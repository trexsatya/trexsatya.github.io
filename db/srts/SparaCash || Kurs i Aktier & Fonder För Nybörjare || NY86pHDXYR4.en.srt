1
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:15,000
I run a Youtube channel and website called SpareCash.se and I started it in 2016.

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:21,000
I became a millionaire as a 27-year-old, it's such a title that newspapers and everything else love to flag with.

3
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Then it goes up and down as you understand, the stock market turns a lot.

4
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:36,000
But my channel anyway, it has 43,500 subscribers, a thousand views about every day.

5
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Overall, over 3.3 million views on the channel.

6
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:46,000
And I have about 500-1000 views on my website at sparecash.se every day.

7
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:53,000
So it is so that you want to learn more about the basics because today we will run about an hour and a half.

8
00:00:53,000 --> 00:01:01,000
So this channel is great, I think.
 But I'm a little biased in this then.

9
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:06,000
But there are a lot of people who appreciate it anyway, as you can see, I'm the biggest in finance on Youtube,

10
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:11,000
As privately owned then, which is not run by Handelsbanken or something like that.

11
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:16,000
And a little story, a background then, to how everything started.

12
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:22,000
So I actually started as a lecturer on young stock savers a few years ago.

13
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:27,000
As you can see here I was in Strängnäs and lectured to a bunch of high school students.

14
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:30,000
And it is a project called Young Private Economics.

15
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:39,000
And then you go through these grounds, shares, funds, savings, pensions and stuff in a short time.

16
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Meanwhile, I traded and played Allan Ballan on the stock exchange as a 19-year-old.

17
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:51,000
And lost quite a lot of money.

18
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:58,000
20,000 on turbocharges, which I heard here, in just over two hours.

19
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:03,000
And then I got a mindset and thought it is better to do something with the money

20
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Instead of just sitting and playing with them to make them try to grow.

21
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:10,000
So I booked a trip to Thailand, to Bangkok.

22
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:13,000
And then I was away, there I was a little more fit.

23
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Snorkeled with whale sharks in the Philippines and got some other thoughts of life.

24
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:24,000
I was in Australia too and saw these cute Wallabies.

25
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:29,000
But while I was in Australia, I got a mindset

26
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:34,000
And I wrote in my notepad on the computer.

27
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Start Your Own Shit.

28
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:41,000
And it was there that, like the foundation for Sparecash, started.

29
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:47,000
So I came home and started knocking code, programming and building sparecash.se.

30
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:52,000
And that was the foundation.
 And it is 2016 and today I live on this.

31
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:56,000
So it's a little short info about me and what I do.

32
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
So this is my full -time job in principle.

33
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:03,000
The goal then was with Sparecash to get beginners to dare to invest.

34
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Because I know how complicated it is.

35
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:09,000
Mathias, you and I are, after all, childhood friends.

36
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Got some questions from you on Facebook about shares and stuff.

37
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,000
And then I felt that why not just build a blog or something

38
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:20,000
So that people can get this simple info in an easy -to -understand way.

39
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
And now I have a shirt on me.

40
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Usually I don't have a shirt on me.

41
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Because I don't want to appear as a banker or anything.

42
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Because I have a little anger against them.

43
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Because you often formulate info quite advanced.

44
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:36,000
But at least it succeeded well.

45
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:39,000
As I mentioned 500-1000 visitors per day.

46
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:43,000
The great thing about spacash is that we also have a discord server

47
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Which is open and free that you can join.

48
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:48,000
And we have a Facebook group with 22,000 members

49
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:51,000
Where you can ask questions and stuff as well.

50
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:54,000
So yes, there you can go in.

51
00:03:54,000 --> 00:04:00,000
On the website we have more than 150 articles, guides and the same on Youtube.

52
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:05,000
Great Success, so far anyway.

53
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
But we haven't stopped there.

54
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:14,000
But now I think we should go into what I guess you are all here for.

55
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:17,000
Right?
 Learning about shares and funds.

56
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Yes, awesome!

57
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Is that as I said so you have any questions

58
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:28,000
So just pause me and get up a hand and set it.

59
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
I don't want me to just stand here and talk without

60
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:35,000
I really want you to also be involved.

61
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:40,000
So I want you to reach out a hand if you know what a share is.

62
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Raise them out loud now so I see it.

63
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Does anyone know what a stock is?

64
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:52,000
Great!

65
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:57,000
Raise up one hand if you know what a fund is.

66
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
Super good!

67
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:02,000
Does anyone know what a fund is?

68
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:05,000
Great, lovely!
 We have a little mixed level here today.

69
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:12,000
And then I want you who have bought funds entirely yourself to reach a hand high.

70
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Yes, a couple.

71
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:20,000
And if you have bought shares all by yourself, I want you to reached a hand.

72
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:23,000
Great!

73
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:27,000
A little 50-50.
 I actually had a mentimeter here before

74
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:31,000
But it takes too long so we drive hand raising.

75
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
But type 50-50.

76
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:37,000
And then I think like this now that we should go through.

77
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:41,000
It is not in order but we have written some points.

78
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:46,000
Common mistakes that I have made on my ten years on the stock exchange.

79
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:50,000
And then common mistakes that you will make if you start investing.

80
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:53,000
When you start investing.

81
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:58,000
We will also go through some basic theory of how shares and funds work.

82
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:01,000
How to buy them.

83
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:07,000
And also which shares and funds I do not recommend

84
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:12,000
But still suggest that you may want to choose if you are a beginner.

85
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:17,000
So, if we start with my mistakes I have done.

86
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:21,000
Number one I mentioned.
 Tried to play Daytrades.

87
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:25,000
And if there is any word here now that people do not understand then stay me and ask "Marcus, can you explain it?"

88
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
What is a Daytrader?

89
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
Great question.

90
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:34,000
A Daytrades is short for daytrading.

91
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:39,000
This means buying a share or an investment today.

92
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
Maybe in the morning.

93
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:45,000
And then you sell it in the evening to make money during one day.

94
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:48,000
Then there is also something called swingtrading.

95
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
Or swing trader.

96
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:55,000
It has nothing to do with the swingers here.

97
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:59,000
It's about owning a share for a little longer.

98
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
But also in the short term.

99
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:05,000
So maybe a week, maybe a month and try to make money in the short term.

100
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:09,000
And then we have those like me who are long -term investors instead.

101
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:13,000
So daytrading is that you try to make quick money.

102
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:18,000
And one more mistake is that I have not been long -term enough.

103
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:22,000
And that is, for example, here you see a graph at Fortnox.

104
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:25,000
Which is an accounting company.

105
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:28,000
And then you see that this is a five -year graph.

106
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:31,000
So when the green line goes up, you make money.

107
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
When it goes down you lose money.

108
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
Or it increases or drops in value then.

109
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:38,000
And I owned it for maybe two, three months.

110
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:44,000
If I had kept it for five years instead, maybe I had doubled my money instead.

111
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:49,000
To earn maybe 10 percent on it, I could have made 600 percent.

112
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:52,000
An example of not being long -term.

113
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:56,000
Missed to take home profits and ignored for high values.

114
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
And there is a picture of it.

115
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
Which is sinch!

116
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
Have you seen my Youtube channel.

117
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:06,000
Then you have seen some videos about the company Sinch.

118
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:11,000
Where the blue pups are when I buy and the red pups when I sell.

119
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:15,000
Can anyone explain what the error is with this picture?

120
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:18,000
Or what I've done wrong?

121
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:22,000
You buy when it's expensive.

122
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
Exactly.

123
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:28,000
I actually bought pretty well in the beginning.

124
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:32,000
But the problem is that I continued to buy when it was fell.

125
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
But it is impossible to know.

126
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:38,000
If I were to cross this picture until we're on top.

127
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:41,000
Then everyone had said ooh what a nice stock.

128
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:45,000
But no one knows how it will go in the future.

129
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:49,000
What I didn't think about was the valuation of this company.

130
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:52,000
It was quite expensive and highly valued.

131
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
This is almost a whole lecture.

132
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:58,000
about how to know it is high or low valued.

133
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:01,000
I can try to make it a bit in the end.

134
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,000
But that was the problem.

135
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,000
Then when it fell, I sold the shares.

136
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
And mistakes you will make.

137
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,000
If you are now starting to invest.

138
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,000
When you start investing.

139
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
You will make mistakes.

140
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:16,000
That you try to chase quick money.

141
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
As I said.

142
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:22,000
You go in.
 It increases by 5% - good then I take home the profit.

143
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
Sell off in panic when something falls.

144
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,000
It is also common.

145
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
When it dives 5-10 percent.

146
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:35,000
So it is not certain that it is justified for it to do so.

147
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,000
Without it, maybe it is that.

148
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:40,000
Yes there was a war somewhere in Europe.

149
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:45,000
And that does not mean that the company is going worse for it.

150
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:48,000
So sometimes it can be good to have some ice in the stomach.

151
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
This point.

152
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:53,000
Buy shares that you don't understand.

153
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:56,000
Does anyone can answer what I mean?

154
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,000
No you drive.

155
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,000
That one does not understand the product

156
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,000
Great.

157
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:11,000
Hard to value.

158
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,000
Hard to understand the whole and the future about the company.

159
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
Exactly.

160
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
That you do not understand the product.

161
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:21,000
We will get into what shares are for something.

162
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,000
In short, shares are a company.

163
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,000
And when you buy shares.

164
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:28,000
So it is good to know what the company does for something.

165
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
If I buy shares in Holmen.

166
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:33,000
Because I have seen this in town.

167
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,000
I even know what they actually do.

168
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:38,000
There is something about paper and so on.

169
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
Forest and a little so.

170
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,000
Yes sometimes it is enough.

171
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:47,000
But sometimes you may have to cave in and understand what they are making money from.

172
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:51,000
So it is important to buy shares that you understand.

173
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,000
A common mistake to.

174
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:56,000
Is that you get greedy when something goes up.

175
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
Although you do not understand why.

176
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:01,000
As you saw in my case with the share Sinch.

177
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,000
I bought more as soon as it went down.

178
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:06,000
Bought more and thought this is just a dip.

179
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,000
It will turn up soon.

180
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
It didn't.

181
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:13,000
So it's pretty common if you get greedy then.

182
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,000
And the last point I wrote in little text.

183
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,000
Because I barely got a seat.

184
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
But which is very important.

185
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
You will make mistakes.

186
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,000
But learn from them.

187
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,000
Many people completely leave the stock exchange.

188
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
We talked a little about it on the phone.

189
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
That many who may go into the stock exchange.

190
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,000
Investing a bit.

191
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,000
Losing a lot of money.

192
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,000
They think.

193
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,000
"It's a casino shitty."

194
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,000
"I will never be on the stock exchange again"

195
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:43,000
And then they will lose all potential rises in the future.

196
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,000
And then maybe you save.

197
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
In a savings ponto for his child for 40 years.

198
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:51,000
And misses 500 % rise on the stock exchange.

199
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000
So it is very common.

200
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,000
Some thoughts spontaneously there.

201
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,000
Someone who has something about adding.

202
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,000
As they have been through.

203
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,000
As a mistake maybe.

204
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,000
I have been with 2 things you are talking about.

205
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:12,000
Before Corona broke out.

206
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,000
So I had.

207
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000
Quite a lot of money on the stock exchange.

208
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,000
And it.

209
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,000
After all, it dropped.

210
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,000
It was many years.

211
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:25,000
Incorrected crowns that fell.

212
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,000
But then it went up again.

213
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,000
And then I chose to sell the shit.

214
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,000
And never ever.

215
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,000
Put my foot on the stock exchange again.

216
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,000
I did it.

217
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,000
Now.

218
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,000
I put them on.

219
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,000
Long -term.

220
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,000
Long -term funds instead.

221
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,000
But.

222
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,000
I laid.

223
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,000
My private pension.

224
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,000
On something I might not have done.

225
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,000
And.

226
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:56,000
I am not a one who goes to Avanza and looks every day.

227
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,000
But maybe I look once every six months.

228
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,000
But I had a discussion with a friend.

229
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,000
And I prayed.

230
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,000
"I save in this"

231
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,000
But I can go in and show how it goes.

232
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,000
And then they had gone bankrupt.

233
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,000
And that was my pension.

234
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,000
Yes it sucks ...

235
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,000
But.

236
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,000
Was the private pension couple?

237
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,000
So I had put in.

238
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,000
SEK 500-1000 each month.

239
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,000
As well as.

240
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,000
500-1000 not 500000. *giggle *

241
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,000
You don't know!
 - No you don't!
 ;)

242
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,000
It was a little.

243
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,000
Typical.

244
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,000
It's not something I hang lip for.

245
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,000
It's a bit that you've gone into.

246
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,000
I knew what the company was doing.

247
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,000
And I saw.

248
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,000
That they wanted to.

249
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,000
But it was like.

250
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,000
How do they earn money.

251
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,000
And it was there.

252
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,000
I might not have been aware.

253
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,000
Exactly.

254
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,000
But that has been learned from their mistakes.

255
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,000
Great.

256
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,000
Spread the risks.

257
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,000
Just.

258
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,000
Great thing.

259
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,000
Unfortunately, it is so.

260
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,000
Companies go bankrupt sometimes.

261
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,000
Therefore, it is important when choosing shares.

262
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,000
That you look at them.

263
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,000
And we will come in on a few different pieces.

264
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,000
How to avoid them.

265
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,000
To filter out such companies.

266
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,000
Which can potentially go bankrupt.

267
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,000
It is by far the worst outcome.

268
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,000
When we invest.

269
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,000
If a company goes bankrupt.

270
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,000
Then we lose all our money.

271
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,000
There is no value left then.

272
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,000
Most often.

273
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,000
And now we will go into some theory.

274
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,000
And as I said.

275
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,000
Don't be afraid to cancel.

276
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,000
And ask questions.

277
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,000
And often.

278
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,000
So it usually looks like this.

279
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,000
When talking to someone.

280
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,000
About shares and funds.

281
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,000
It is said that shares are high risk.

282
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:54,000
And it is said that funds are low risk.

283
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:57,000
What do you think about that?

284
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,000
You shake your head!

285
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,000
Incorrect.

286
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,000
Why?

287
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,000
The funds also own shares.

288
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,000
Exactly.

289
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,000
It's wrong.

290
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,000
Just as you say.

291
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,000
But if we say this.

292
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,000
That shares are higher risk.

293
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,000
And funds are high risk.

294
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,000
Do you think it sounds better?

295
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,000
Yes it can be.

296
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,000
It can be.

297
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,000
It can be so.
 Depends on which company you are investing in.

298
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,000
Yes.

299
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,000
I did that.

300
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,000
I wrote that this is right anyway.

301
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,000
But that is a subjective issue.

302
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,000
But I would still say that.

303
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,000
To stock.

304
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,000
Many people are looking for stable shares.

305
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,000
Safe shares.

306
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,000
There are safe companies.

307
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,000
But you still have to keep in mind that as an investment.

308
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,000
So shares are always high risk.

309
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:52,000
And almost always higher risk than funds are.

310
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,000
But both are still high risk.

311
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,000
Because you stop your money.

312
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,000
And they will swing in value.

313
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,000
So.

314
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,000
Then it depends on how you define risk.

315
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,000
Easily explained.

316
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,000
Higher risk in shares.

317
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,000
High risk in funds.

318
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,000
And what is the difference between equities and funds?

319
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,000
Now let's see if.

320
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:15,000
I thought about showing here.

321
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,000
Because everyone has not seen me before.

322
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:19,000
So I'll see if I can outsource this to myself.

323
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,000
And yes the biggest.

324
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,000
The difference between shares and funds.

325
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:25,000
It is that when you buy shares.

326
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,000
So you indirectly own part of a company.

327
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,000
And if you buy a fund instead.

328
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:33,000
Then you get some of a bunch of different shares.

329
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,000
Up to 20-50 different companies.

330
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,000
Maybe you get if you invest in a fund.

331
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,000
So.

332
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,000
So there it may look.

333
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,000
It's a pretty old video you see.

334
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,000
I had no glasses on me.

335
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,000
But.

336
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,000
Now this is also the example.

337
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,000
Pretty fun.

338
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,000
I don't know if anyone sees an error here on the left side.

339
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,000
Ica I heard!

340
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,000
They no longer exist - exactly.

341
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,000
It is a limited company.

342
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,000
But you can't buy them over the stock exchange anymore.

343
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:09,000
Because they were bought.

344
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,000
Or purchased from the stock exchange.

345
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,000
But the practice is like this.

346
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:15,000
If you buy shares, you buy a share.

347
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,000
Or a business.

348
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,000
When you buy a fund.

349
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,000
So.

350
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,000
With the traditional rules in Sweden.

351
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,000
So you get at least 16 companies.

352
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,000
On a fund.

353
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,000
And that's why I say it.

354
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,000
Funds are high risk.

355
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:36,000
But it is not as high risk as buying a stock.

356
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:39,000
I think it was you who said it.
 To spread the risk then.

357
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:42,000
And that's what is so nice with funds.

358
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:48,000
If you are a beginner, maybe start by buying a fund.
 To then spread the risk among several companies.

359
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:52,000
So it's good to start with a fund so you don't have to think about it.

360
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:55,000
That one must buy 10-20 shares yourself

361
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:57,000
And when choosing between them here.

362
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:59,000
So I usually say this.

363
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:01,000
Do you want to spend time on your savings?

364
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:03,000
Yes or no?

365
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,000
What do you say?

366
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,000
Do you want to spend time on your savings?

367
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:09,000
No?

368
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:11,000
You shake your head a little.

369
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:13,000
You?

370
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,000
And you?

371
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,000
No?

372
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,000
Yes.

373
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:21,000
So yes then I would say that you can buy shares.

374
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,000
But if you don't feel like it.

375
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,000
Then choose funds.

376
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:31,777
And are you interested in specific companies?

377
00:18:32,290 --> 00:18:36,076
Yes but then choose shares.

378
00:18:36,076 --> 00:18:37,000
If you think

379
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:40,410
Spotify they will go well.
 Yes but maybe buy some shares in them then

380
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:43,000
But if you are not interested - buy funds.

381
00:18:45,547 --> 00:18:50,196
Are you okay with your money swinging up and down very much?

382
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:56,324
If you say yes here.

383
00:18:56,324 --> 00:18:59,716
Then maybe you can lean on buying shares.

384
00:18:59,716 --> 00:19:05,000
But if you are not comfortable with it.
 Then you should stick to funds.

385
00:19:05,812 --> 00:19:10,000
Because I think most people will understand it when I show this picture.

386
00:19:10,196 --> 00:19:12,196
It is taken today.

387
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:17,691
And this is a company called Hexatronic.
 Does anyone recognize this company?

388
00:19:17,691 --> 00:19:19,000
Yes.

389
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:21,854
Does anyone own shares in Hexatronic?

390
00:19:22,110 --> 00:19:24,068
No longer.

391
00:19:24,239 --> 00:19:25,000
Did you sell today?

392
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:27,555
No a few months ago.

393
00:19:27,555 --> 00:19:29,000
Yes the same here.

394
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:31,641
Yes I suffer with you who own shares in Hexatronic.

395
00:19:31,641 --> 00:19:34,794
Today, the share fell 32 or more percent.

396
00:19:35,612 --> 00:19:39,000
And it is like this that can happen when you own individual shares!

397
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,513
Because I have also owned Hexatronic.

398
00:19:42,026 --> 00:19:45,174
And went from having made a mega win

399
00:19:45,174 --> 00:19:47,000
To leave.

400
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:49,000
I think I made a thousand dollars in profit.

401
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:51,000
But from having been in 200,000 plus in Hexatronic.

402
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:53,000
Down to maybe 20,000 plus.

403
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:55,000
Or less.

404
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:57,000
I do not remember.

405
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:59,000
I've suppressed it.

406
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:01,000
So it's like this.

407
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:03,000
This is how you buy shares.

408
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:05,000
It can be so.

409
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:11,000
So now we come up with a little how to start.

410
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:13,000
So now we come up with a little how to start.

411
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:15,000
If you are going to start investing then.

412
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:17,000
And here from my website.

413
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:19,000
Sparecash.se

414
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:21,000
Then I have a list of slightly different shares and fund brokers.

415
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:23,000
Then I have a list of slightly different shares and fund brokers.

416
00:20:23,590 --> 00:20:27,000
And now I thought it was just a little quick going through them.

417
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:29,000
So you have a phone with QR code scanner.

418
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:31,000
So you can scan and get there directly.

419
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:33,000
So you have them lying on their phone.

420
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:35,000
Because you who are here.

421
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:38,794
I want everyone in here to start investing.

422
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:43,563
So be sure to scan them here and put them in the browser.
 So you have them there.

423
00:20:43,563 --> 00:20:47,691
And then after this lecture we sit down and chat a little out there.

424
00:20:47,691 --> 00:20:50,246
And then you open accounts so you get started.

425
00:20:50,658 --> 00:20:53,427
So you don't go from here and just think "what should I do for something"

426
00:20:53,427 --> 00:20:55,000
It is today we start.

427
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:58,453
The best day to invest was yesterday.

428
00:20:58,453 --> 00:21:02,375
The second best day to invest is today.

429
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:06,068
Avanza is what I use most.

430
00:21:07,248 --> 00:21:10,000
Then you scan that code and you will get there right there!

431
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:16,400
It is free to save in shares and funds up to 50,000 in total savings

432
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:19,000
Then you get the fees back

433
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:21,000
Once you have reached 50,000

434
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:23,000
Then it starts to cost fees.

435
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:28,640
They have the largest range of funds and shares in Sweden by the niche brokers.

436
00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:31,299
The easiest way to use I think.

437
00:21:31,299 --> 00:21:35,403
I mostly use it.
 And you get interest on ISK.

438
00:21:38,094 --> 00:21:42,609
Interest rates on savings account get up to 3.7%

439
00:21:42,609 --> 00:21:44,760
Does anyone recognize Avanza?

440
00:21:44,760 --> 00:21:47,760
Yes, most.

441
00:21:48,760 --> 00:21:54,360
I will go through five different ones here.

442
00:21:54,360 --> 00:21:58,520
I see that we have one that records physically, which I like.

443
00:21:58,520 --> 00:22:02,000
Am I too fast here, so tell me and stay.

444
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:07,560
Next we have Nordnet, which is a major player in Scandinavia.

445
00:22:07,560 --> 00:22:11,760
Here, too, they have up to 50,000 in total savings without fees.

446
00:22:11,760 --> 00:22:14,520
This means that you can start at Avanza.

447
00:22:14,560 --> 00:22:18,520
Once you have reached 50,000, you can switch to Nordnet.

448
00:22:18,520 --> 00:22:21,920
So you can save 100,000 without fees.

449
00:22:21,920 --> 00:22:25,920
Fantastic.

450
00:22:25,920 --> 00:22:28,320
They also have English language in the app.

451
00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:35,520
If you are not so good in Swedish, then this is better than Avanza's app.

452
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:37,920
If you prefer English.

453
00:22:37,920 --> 00:22:43,960
Interest rate on savings account is 3.6% so Avanza is a little better.

454
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,000
Then we have a newcomer.

455
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:50,000
I forgot to ask how many recognize Nordnet?

456
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:52,200
Not as many.

457
00:22:52,200 --> 00:22:54,600
It proves that Avanza has a strong brand.

458
00:22:54,600 --> 00:22:58,600
And my shares there are doing well.

459
00:22:58,600 --> 00:23:01,200
But Nordnet also has good potential.

460
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:05,000
Levler, how many recognize it?

461
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:07,600
One.
 No other.

462
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:10,600
Today I heard about them.

463
00:23:10,840 --> 00:23:14,040
Levler is a bit like a Avanza/Nordnet, though even less.

464
00:23:14,040 --> 00:23:17,040
Owned by Söderberg Partners.

465
00:23:17,040 --> 00:23:22,040
They offer that you can buy shares free of charge.

466
00:23:22,040 --> 00:23:26,040
So you can buy shares completely free of charge.

467
00:23:26,040 --> 00:23:31,440
Until the billion, until 2025.

468
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:32,640
It's great.

469
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:37,640
Easy to use.
 25 % discount on fund fees compared to Avanza Nordnet.

470
00:23:37,680 --> 00:23:42,680
The fund fee you receive at the big bank and Avanza Nordnet.

471
00:23:42,680 --> 00:23:45,680
Discounts by 25 %!

472
00:23:45,680 --> 00:23:48,680
I think so.

473
00:23:48,680 --> 00:23:51,680
And they have a slightly higher interest rate on ISK.

474
00:23:51,680 --> 00:23:54,680
This one is for those who like to buy clothes.

475
00:23:54,680 --> 00:23:57,680
So you should use without Levler.

476
00:23:57,680 --> 00:24:00,680
For Levler looks like you are at Zalando.

477
00:24:00,680 --> 00:24:03,680
So they have simpler user interfaces.

478
00:24:03,680 --> 00:24:06,680
Is it easy to change the bank?

479
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:09,720
Great question.

480
00:24:09,720 --> 00:24:12,720
I would say both yes and no.

481
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:15,720
If you are running in an investment savings account.

482
00:24:15,720 --> 00:24:20,720
Then you can move the entire investment savings account to the bank.

483
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:24,720
But if you have a capital insurance, you cannot move from bank to bank.

484
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:29,720
So if you want to be able to move from bank to bank, it runs an investment savings account.

485
00:24:29,720 --> 00:24:32,720
But I think it sucks a little.

486
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:35,720
Too often it can take a month to move the entire account.

487
00:24:35,760 --> 00:24:38,760
And unless the investments are there.

488
00:24:38,760 --> 00:24:41,760
For example, if Levler has a little limited supply of shares.

489
00:24:41,760 --> 00:24:44,760
They do not have foreign shares yet.

490
00:24:44,760 --> 00:24:47,760
Then you have to sell them.

491
00:24:47,760 --> 00:24:50,760
Then you will not bring them to the other bank.

492
00:24:50,760 --> 00:24:53,760
Could it also be purchasing information that you lose?

493
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:56,760
Yes exactly.

494
00:24:56,760 --> 00:24:59,760
You lose what you have bought in for price.

495
00:24:59,760 --> 00:25:02,760
So you have to enter it manually.

496
00:25:02,800 --> 00:25:08,800
If you have purchased your shares in Telia or Holmen to SEK 100.

497
00:25:08,800 --> 00:25:11,800
And now they stand in SEK 300 so maybe it will not come along.

498
00:25:11,800 --> 00:25:14,800
But at Avanza and Nordnet you can change it.

499
00:25:14,800 --> 00:25:17,800
So then you can put it in.

500
00:25:17,800 --> 00:25:20,800
I think there are several apps.

501
00:25:20,800 --> 00:25:25,800
Can you move other shares and funds on all different shares?

502
00:25:25,800 --> 00:25:28,800
Great question.
 If they have the same range then?

503
00:25:28,840 --> 00:25:31,840
This one is a bit limited at present.

504
00:25:31,840 --> 00:25:34,840
It is quite newly started.

505
00:25:34,840 --> 00:25:37,840
But if you want to get hold of all shares, it's Avanza and Nordnet.

506
00:25:37,840 --> 00:25:41,840
But there is then if you may want to buy shares in Poland.

507
00:25:41,840 --> 00:25:48,840
Or maybe in the UK or so.

508
00:25:48,840 --> 00:25:51,840
So it can be a little limited.

509
00:25:51,840 --> 00:25:56,840
But often you have American, Swedish, Norwegian, Danish, German and Avanza and Nordnet.

510
00:25:56,880 --> 00:25:59,880
Then it is the others who are a little limited then.

511
00:26:01,880 --> 00:26:04,880
Savr we went on.

512
00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:08,880
SAVR is a platform just for funds at present.

513
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:13,880
They offer a discount on the fund fees like Levler then.

514
00:26:13,880 --> 00:26:16,880
Although they do not have this fixed 25 percent.

515
00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:19,880
It's easy to use and also ...

516
00:26:19,880 --> 00:26:25,880
Are you in the share savers and not using SAVR

517
00:26:25,920 --> 00:26:28,920
So you have SEK 300 to start investing for.

518
00:26:28,920 --> 00:26:32,920
If you choose to join SAVR and are a member.

519
00:26:32,920 --> 00:26:35,920
If you are not members then you can become members

520
00:26:35,920 --> 00:26:40,920
And then you automatically get SEK 300 to save for in SAVR.

521
00:26:40,920 --> 00:26:43,920
More information on the membership page, the share savers.

522
00:26:43,920 --> 00:26:46,920
Yes, they can talk to you then after.

523
00:26:46,920 --> 00:26:51,920
SAVR is good and there you get 300 bucks with the share savers and membership.

524
00:26:51,960 --> 00:26:56,960
When you invite friends you get 100 bucks.

525
00:26:56,960 --> 00:26:59,960
Because I have Instagram account.

526
00:26:59,960 --> 00:27:02,960
Unfortunately, now they have limited it.

527
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:07,960
Back in the days then, I think I got 5,000.

528
00:27:07,960 --> 00:27:10,960
You can invite friends and get 100 SEK.

529
00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:13,960
And so it goes straight into the investment savings account.

530
00:27:13,960 --> 00:27:15,960
Shit smart.

531
00:27:15,960 --> 00:27:18,960
They will launch stock trading in the future as well.

532
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:21,000
I think they also pay.

533
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:24,000
Do you know the programmers who are good?

534
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:26,000
So email them.

535
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:34,691
I think they pay type 20,000 if they find a programmer.

536
00:27:36,828 --> 00:27:38,836
Shit smart, free cash!

537
00:27:39,391 --> 00:27:45,789
It is a little cheaper to save in the fund at SAVR.
 Because they take a platform fee.

538
00:27:45,789 --> 00:27:49,023
Instead of that fee Avanza and Nordnet takes.

539
00:27:49,244 --> 00:27:56,466
Levler, for example, has a fixed 25% discount

540
00:27:56,466 --> 00:28:01,040
While SAVR you get 5 % and you get 25 %.

541
00:28:01,040 --> 00:28:06,322
But you can always compare where it is the cheapest if you want to buy a fund.

542
00:28:06,322 --> 00:28:13,620
Check out what it costs at Avanza and SAVR and then make a decision.

543
00:28:16,824 --> 00:28:19,635
Aktieinvest!

544
00:28:19,635 --> 00:28:23,498
This one is a little fun because it was owned by the share savers a while ago.

545
00:28:24,481 --> 00:28:29,566
Even there, it is free to buy stock but up to 60,000 instead of 50,000.

546
00:28:29,824 --> 00:28:35,523
This I have not really agreed as well as Avanza Nordnet.
 But it works.

547
00:28:35,523 --> 00:28:40,120
The best thing about Aktieinvest is the second part there.

548
00:28:40,120 --> 00:28:43,120
Which is the purchase of parts of shares.

549
00:28:43,120 --> 00:28:47,120
If you want to buy a share in Apple or Google.

550
00:28:47,120 --> 00:28:50,120
So maybe you must have 1000 SEK.

551
00:28:50,120 --> 00:28:52,120
But here you can buy part of a share.

552
00:28:52,120 --> 00:28:54,120
So you don't have to have 1000 SEK.

553
00:28:54,120 --> 00:28:57,120
Without it, maybe SEK 100 is enough.

554
00:28:57,120 --> 00:28:59,120
So that's the best.

555
00:28:59,120 --> 00:29:01,120
There is also another platform that I just started testing.

556
00:29:01,120 --> 00:29:03,120
Called Kiwi Trader.

557
00:29:03,120 --> 00:29:05,120
Which is similar.

558
00:29:05,160 --> 00:29:07,160
I can add there.

559
00:29:07,160 --> 00:29:11,160
The good thing about Aktieinvest is also that you can save monthly in shares.

560
00:29:11,160 --> 00:29:15,160
So you can say that 1000 SEK you want to invest per month.

561
00:29:15,160 --> 00:29:18,160
Then you can choose which shares to invest in.

562
00:29:18,160 --> 00:29:21,160
And it does not offer many others.

563
00:29:21,160 --> 00:29:24,160
It is often that you saving monthly in funds.

564
00:29:24,160 --> 00:29:27,160
But here you can save monthly in the shares you want.

565
00:29:27,160 --> 00:29:29,160
Found in Aktieinvest.

566
00:29:29,160 --> 00:29:31,160
If you want to spend time and check it out.

567
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:34,200
And it was owned by the share savers that you mentioned.

568
00:29:34,200 --> 00:29:36,200
Exactly.

569
00:29:36,200 --> 00:29:38,200
Those kiwi trader as i said too

570
00:29:38,200 --> 00:29:40,200
I have started testing them.
 It is the same.

571
00:29:40,200 --> 00:29:42,200
So it's great.

572
00:29:42,200 --> 00:29:45,200
You can build a whole portfolio with 50 different American shares.

573
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:48,200
It is a very low cost to save monthly.

574
00:29:48,200 --> 00:29:50,200
And they also have savings boxes.

575
00:29:50,200 --> 00:29:52,200
It's kind of a bit like funds ..

576
00:29:52,200 --> 00:29:54,200
But read the price lists.

577
00:29:54,200 --> 00:29:58,200
Because I know it was part of these cooperative shares.

578
00:29:58,240 --> 00:30:01,240
There may be some hidden fees that you do not understand.

579
00:30:01,240 --> 00:30:04,223
So it is important to read them too.

580
00:30:07,240 --> 00:30:08,240
Okay.

581
00:30:08,240 --> 00:30:13,240
Now you have found out where to start investing.

582
00:30:13,240 --> 00:30:17,308
You have these banks on the phone.

583
00:30:18,240 --> 00:30:22,240
And now there is some outsourcing of Marcus again.

584
00:30:22,240 --> 00:30:25,240
And when you have opened an account at a bank.

585
00:30:25,280 --> 00:30:29,280
Then you need an account to have your shares or funds on.

586
00:30:29,280 --> 00:30:32,280
And there are three such types of account.

587
00:30:32,280 --> 00:30:34,280
There is a equity fund account.

588
00:30:34,280 --> 00:30:36,280
There is an investment savings account.

589
00:30:36,280 --> 00:30:38,280
And there is a capital insurance.

590
00:30:38,280 --> 00:30:40,280
When you buy Swedish shares.

591
00:30:40,280 --> 00:30:43,280
So I recommend that you have an investment savings account.

592
00:30:43,280 --> 00:30:45,280
Because it has a low tax.

593
00:30:45,280 --> 00:30:48,280
And you don't have to declare your business to the Swedish Tax Agency.

594
00:30:48,280 --> 00:30:50,280
Do you have a equity fund account.

595
00:30:50,280 --> 00:30:53,280
So you have to pay 30% tax on profits.

596
00:30:53,320 --> 00:30:56,320
And besides, you have to declare this.

597
00:30:56,320 --> 00:30:59,320
So in your tax return after you have sold your shares.

598
00:30:59,320 --> 00:31:02,320
Then you have to report it to the Swedish Tax Agency.

599
00:31:02,320 --> 00:31:04,320
And it can be a little complicated.

600
00:31:04,320 --> 00:31:06,320
So, as I said, open an account at a bank.

601
00:31:06,320 --> 00:31:08,320
Open an investment savings account.

602
00:31:08,320 --> 00:31:10,320
And then you're up and running.

603
00:31:12,320 --> 00:31:14,320
Like, briefly explained.

604
00:31:14,320 --> 00:31:17,320
Choose one of these brokers that I have shown.

605
00:31:17,320 --> 00:31:19,320
Or all.

606
00:31:19,320 --> 00:31:21,320
It does not matter.
 Test everyone.

607
00:31:21,360 --> 00:31:24,360
Open an account on a bank and then open an ISK account.

608
00:31:24,360 --> 00:31:26,360
It's kind of the easiest.

609
00:31:26,360 --> 00:31:28,360
Low tax, you don't have to think so much about it.

610
00:31:28,360 --> 00:31:31,360
The tax comes in pre -printed in the declaration.

611
00:31:32,360 --> 00:31:36,360
It is important to point out that it does not cost to open several accounts either.

612
00:31:36,360 --> 00:31:39,360
You can have an account for different purposes.

613
00:31:39,360 --> 00:31:41,360
For that I also get questions about.

614
00:31:41,360 --> 00:31:43,360
Does it cost anything to open an account?

615
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:45,360
No, you can open.

616
00:31:45,360 --> 00:31:47,360
Open as many accounts as you like.

617
00:31:47,360 --> 00:31:49,360
Exactly, great Byron.

618
00:31:49,400 --> 00:31:52,400
It is therefore completely free of charge to open accounts at these banks.

619
00:31:52,400 --> 00:31:55,400
And it is free of charge to open an investment savings account.

620
00:31:55,400 --> 00:31:58,400
At my Avanza I have two investment savings accounts.

621
00:31:58,400 --> 00:32:00,400
A capital insurance.

622
00:32:00,400 --> 00:32:02,400
Some have 20 investment savings accounts.

623
00:32:02,400 --> 00:32:05,400
Just to test different strategies and such.

624
00:32:05,400 --> 00:32:07,400
Or different purposes.

625
00:32:07,400 --> 00:32:11,400
This is an account for children, for the trip, to the car.

626
00:32:11,400 --> 00:32:14,400
It depends on what one is for a person.

627
00:32:14,400 --> 00:32:16,400
Exactly.

628
00:32:16,440 --> 00:32:18,440
Have order and find out.

629
00:32:23,440 --> 00:32:25,440
Okay.

630
00:32:25,440 --> 00:32:27,440
Investment savings account, low tax.

631
00:32:27,440 --> 00:32:29,440
Don't have to declare.

632
00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:31,440
Equity fund account, maybe I should say so before.

633
00:32:31,440 --> 00:32:33,440
When you open the account first.

634
00:32:33,440 --> 00:32:36,440
Do not throw 100,000 into an investment savings account.

635
00:32:36,440 --> 00:32:38,440
And then it doesn't matter.

636
00:32:38,440 --> 00:32:40,440
Because then you have to pay tax on them.

637
00:32:40,440 --> 00:32:43,440
For every penny you deposit into the investment savings account.

638
00:32:43,440 --> 00:32:45,440
Raises the tax that comes then in the declaration.

639
00:32:46,440 --> 00:32:49,440
First put money into such a common thing.

640
00:32:49,440 --> 00:32:50,440
Equity fund account.

641
00:32:50,440 --> 00:32:52,440
It gets a little complicated maybe.

642
00:32:52,440 --> 00:32:54,440
And then from there when you know.

643
00:32:54,440 --> 00:32:57,440
I will buy these funds for SEK 1000.

644
00:32:57,440 --> 00:33:00,440
Then you can transfer the money to the investment savings account.

645
00:33:00,440 --> 00:33:02,440
And buy them there.

646
00:33:02,440 --> 00:33:05,440
If you do not have a monthly rolling fund pair.

647
00:33:05,440 --> 00:33:07,440
Which is drawn in ISK.

648
00:33:07,440 --> 00:33:09,440
Automatically

649
00:33:09,440 --> 00:33:11,440
Yes exactly.

650
00:33:11,440 --> 00:33:13,440
Difficult?
 - Yes

651
00:33:13,440 --> 00:33:15,440
Take it again then.

652
00:33:16,440 --> 00:33:18,440
Okay.

653
00:33:18,440 --> 00:33:21,440
Let's say we have Avanza up here.

654
00:33:21,440 --> 00:33:23,440
You see my mouse pointer.

655
00:33:23,440 --> 00:33:25,440
So you deposit money.

656
00:33:25,440 --> 00:33:28,440
And then you do it in the equity fund account.

657
00:33:28,440 --> 00:33:31,440
Then you also have an ISK account.

658
00:33:31,440 --> 00:33:33,440
And you can have a capital insurance.

659
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:36,440
But as soon as you put money away.

660
00:33:36,440 --> 00:33:37,440
In here.

661
00:33:37,440 --> 00:33:40,440
Then the tax will be increased for you.

662
00:33:40,440 --> 00:33:43,440
Then you will have to pay tax on it.

663
00:33:43,480 --> 00:33:46,480
So money that is in an investment savings account.

664
00:33:46,480 --> 00:33:48,480
You would like to have invested.

665
00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:51,480
Otherwise, you pay tax unnecessarily.

666
00:33:52,480 --> 00:33:54,480
Comment?

667
00:33:54,480 --> 00:33:56,480
Good.

668
00:33:56,480 --> 00:33:58,480
So...

669
00:33:58,480 --> 00:34:01,480
Do not have uninvested money in investment savings account!

670
00:34:01,480 --> 00:34:02,480
Exactly.

671
00:34:02,480 --> 00:34:05,480
And then when you deposit money here too.

672
00:34:05,480 --> 00:34:08,480
So the tax is based on one year.

673
00:34:08,480 --> 00:34:10,480
Without making it too complicated.

674
00:34:10,520 --> 00:34:13,520
So don't put money in and then withdraw them.

675
00:34:13,520 --> 00:34:16,520
And then put in money and withdraw them as a payroll account.

676
00:34:16,520 --> 00:34:19,520
Money you put on the investment savings account.

677
00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:22,520
Let them stay there and be invested.

678
00:34:22,520 --> 00:34:24,520
But for us to catch up with everything.

679
00:34:24,520 --> 00:34:27,520
So I think we will move on to the investments.

680
00:34:27,520 --> 00:34:29,520
That's what you are here for.

681
00:34:29,520 --> 00:34:31,520
For making money or how ...

682
00:34:31,520 --> 00:34:32,520
So...

683
00:34:32,520 --> 00:34:36,520
And now it's time to choose which shares to buy or invest in.

684
00:34:36,520 --> 00:34:38,520
And this can be a little difficult.

685
00:34:38,560 --> 00:34:41,560
I have made many different videos where I talk about finding shares.

686
00:34:41,560 --> 00:34:45,560
But a type of share that I think is worth mentioning if you are a beginner.

687
00:34:45,560 --> 00:34:47,560
These are investment companies.

688
00:34:47,560 --> 00:34:51,560
Investment companies shares, yes they invest in other companies.

689
00:34:51,560 --> 00:34:53,560
So it's almost like buying a fund.

690
00:34:53,560 --> 00:34:56,560
And this I think is a good type of shares to start with.

691
00:34:56,560 --> 00:34:58,560
Because you then spread the risk.

692
00:34:58,560 --> 00:35:00,560
Even if you only buy one share.

693
00:35:00,560 --> 00:35:04,560
So your risk is spread to the companies in which they in turn own shares.

694
00:35:04,560 --> 00:35:07,560
And examples of investment companies are Investor.

695
00:35:07,600 --> 00:35:08,600
Industrivärden.

696
00:35:08,600 --> 00:35:09,600
Lundbergs.

697
00:35:09,600 --> 00:35:10,600
Crees.

698
00:35:10,600 --> 00:35:11,600
Svolder.

699
00:35:11,600 --> 00:35:14,600
Yes, there are many different investment companies that are ...

700
00:35:14,600 --> 00:35:17,600
Which is good, I would say.

701
00:35:17,600 --> 00:35:19,600
But I'm pausing this one.

702
00:35:22,600 --> 00:35:25,600
So this is what I usually tell beginners about.

703
00:35:25,600 --> 00:35:28,600
When you do not know which shares to buy.

704
00:35:28,600 --> 00:35:30,600
Start with the investment companies.

705
00:35:31,600 --> 00:35:33,600
And what I'm showing here.

706
00:35:33,600 --> 00:35:35,600
This is the investment company.

707
00:35:35,640 --> 00:35:36,640
To be a little clear.

708
00:35:36,640 --> 00:35:38,640
Investor is a company.

709
00:35:38,640 --> 00:35:41,640
Which owns shares in Atlas Copco.

710
00:35:41,640 --> 00:35:42,640
ABB.

711
00:35:42,640 --> 00:35:43,640
AstraZeneca.

712
00:35:43,640 --> 00:35:44,640
Seb.

713
00:35:45,640 --> 00:35:47,640
Do you keep up with how it works?

714
00:35:48,640 --> 00:35:49,640
Good.

715
00:35:49,640 --> 00:35:52,640
So that's why I said it is a bit like buying a fund.

716
00:35:52,640 --> 00:35:55,640
Because they in turn own more shares.

717
00:35:55,640 --> 00:35:57,640
So you don't have to do it yourself.

718
00:35:59,640 --> 00:36:00,640
Industrivärden.

719
00:36:00,640 --> 00:36:01,640
Volvo.

720
00:36:01,640 --> 00:36:02,640
Sandvik.

721
00:36:02,640 --> 00:36:03,640
Handelsbanken.

722
00:36:03,680 --> 00:36:05,680
Do you recognize some of these companies?

723
00:36:08,680 --> 00:36:09,680
Lundbergs.

724
00:36:09,680 --> 00:36:12,680
Does anyone recognize Lundbergs from here town?

725
00:36:14,680 --> 00:36:17,680
Indutrade, Holmen, Lundberg's properties.

726
00:36:17,680 --> 00:36:18,680
And lots of others.

727
00:36:18,680 --> 00:36:20,680
Hufvudstaden and so on.

728
00:36:20,680 --> 00:36:22,680
We have a little more technology focused.

729
00:36:22,680 --> 00:36:25,680
They are the founder of Avanza.

730
00:36:25,680 --> 00:36:26,680
Sticker app.

731
00:36:26,680 --> 00:36:28,680
If you order stickers online.

732
00:36:28,680 --> 00:36:29,680
Google.

733
00:36:29,680 --> 00:36:31,680
Buy stickers.

734
00:36:31,720 --> 00:36:34,720
So you will definitely see this website.

735
00:36:34,720 --> 00:36:35,720
Apotea.

736
00:36:35,720 --> 00:36:37,720
Most people in here I recognize.

737
00:36:38,720 --> 00:36:39,720
Instabox.

738
00:36:39,720 --> 00:36:41,720
Or called Instabee Group Now I think huh.

739
00:36:43,720 --> 00:36:46,720
Svolder, Beijer Group, Troax, New Wave Group.

740
00:36:46,720 --> 00:36:47,720
If you are doing.

741
00:36:47,720 --> 00:36:49,720
Is it Bajen.

742
00:36:49,720 --> 00:36:51,720
So you have probably seen that there is a craft on their sweaters.

743
00:36:51,720 --> 00:36:52,720
So Hammarby.

744
00:36:52,720 --> 00:36:55,720
And they are owned by New Wave.

745
00:36:55,720 --> 00:36:56,720
Or it's a brand.

746
00:36:58,720 --> 00:37:00,720
As you can see, there are still a lot of brands.

747
00:37:00,760 --> 00:37:02,760
As you may have seen sometime.

748
00:37:02,760 --> 00:37:07,760
And why should you chance to buy something like this cancer company.

749
00:37:07,760 --> 00:37:11,760
As any old guy on Facebook tips on.

750
00:37:11,760 --> 00:37:14,760
Where you can instead trust these big companies.

751
00:37:14,760 --> 00:37:17,760
Who has made very good historical returns.

752
00:37:17,760 --> 00:37:18,760
Instead.

753
00:37:18,760 --> 00:37:19,760
As a beginner.

754
00:37:19,760 --> 00:37:21,760
Good tips I think.

755
00:37:21,760 --> 00:37:23,760
Can I add?

756
00:37:23,760 --> 00:37:25,760
Also when looking at investment companies.

757
00:37:25,760 --> 00:37:27,760
So you can take part in companies.

758
00:37:27,760 --> 00:37:29,760
Which you can't buy on the stock exchange yourself.

759
00:37:29,800 --> 00:37:30,800
On the stock market.

760
00:37:30,800 --> 00:37:32,800
So -called unlisted companies.

761
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:34,800
So it is also a huge advantage.

762
00:37:34,800 --> 00:37:35,800
Yes.

763
00:37:36,800 --> 00:37:37,800
Exactly.

764
00:37:37,800 --> 00:37:38,800
What do we have there then?

765
00:37:38,800 --> 00:37:39,800
Spiltan?

766
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:42,800
Apotea can be purchased now.

767
00:37:42,800 --> 00:37:43,800
No.

768
00:37:43,800 --> 00:37:44,800
Exactly.

769
00:37:44,800 --> 00:37:46,800
Apotea and Creades.

770
00:37:47,800 --> 00:37:48,800
Just.

771
00:37:48,800 --> 00:37:49,800
So.

772
00:37:49,800 --> 00:37:50,800
You are.

773
00:37:50,800 --> 00:37:52,800
With an investment company.

774
00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:53,800
As you can see here.

775
00:37:53,800 --> 00:37:54,800
Atlas Copco, ABB.

776
00:37:54,800 --> 00:37:56,800
Seb, AstraZeneca.

777
00:37:56,800 --> 00:37:58,800
All of them can be purchased on the stock exchange.

778
00:37:58,840 --> 00:38:00,840
That is, when you go into Avanza.

779
00:38:00,840 --> 00:38:02,840
And looking for companies.

780
00:38:02,840 --> 00:38:04,840
Then you can find them.

781
00:38:04,840 --> 00:38:06,840
But instead of buying them.

782
00:38:06,840 --> 00:38:08,840
So you can buy Investor.

783
00:38:08,840 --> 00:38:10,840
So you get all them in one package.

784
00:38:10,840 --> 00:38:12,840
But for example.

785
00:38:12,840 --> 00:38:14,840
Apotea, Instabox.

786
00:38:14,840 --> 00:38:15,840
Or instabee.

787
00:38:15,840 --> 00:38:17,840
You cannot buy shares in them.

788
00:38:17,840 --> 00:38:19,840
Or type Savecash AB.

789
00:38:19,840 --> 00:38:21,840
They are not on the stock exchange.

790
00:38:21,840 --> 00:38:23,840
Because I'm a private company.

791
00:38:23,840 --> 00:38:25,840
Small crap company.

792
00:38:25,840 --> 00:38:27,840
But these.

793
00:38:27,880 --> 00:38:28,880
Fine.

794
00:38:28,880 --> 00:38:30,880
You can get them by buying.

795
00:38:30,880 --> 00:38:32,880
For example, Crees.

796
00:38:32,880 --> 00:38:34,880
Then you can ride on the scale that it is going well for them.

797
00:38:34,880 --> 00:38:36,880
And so.

798
00:38:37,880 --> 00:38:39,880
Were you about to say Spiltans?

799
00:38:39,880 --> 00:38:40,880
Yes.

800
00:38:40,880 --> 00:38:42,880
You can buy several of these.

801
00:38:42,880 --> 00:38:44,880
Investment companies.

802
00:38:44,880 --> 00:38:46,880
If you buy Spiltans.

803
00:38:46,880 --> 00:38:47,880
Shares.

804
00:38:47,880 --> 00:38:48,880
Fund.

805
00:38:48,880 --> 00:38:49,880
Equity fund.

806
00:38:49,880 --> 00:38:51,880
Then you get part of.

807
00:38:51,880 --> 00:38:53,880
Then you buy several of these.

808
00:38:53,880 --> 00:38:54,880
Great fund.

809
00:38:54,880 --> 00:38:56,880
I will show it later.

810
00:38:56,920 --> 00:38:57,920
But also.

811
00:38:57,920 --> 00:39:00,920
The investment companies have a lower fee.

812
00:39:00,920 --> 00:39:02,920
Than the funds have.

813
00:39:02,920 --> 00:39:04,920
Great.

814
00:39:04,920 --> 00:39:06,920
Exactly.

815
00:39:06,920 --> 00:39:08,920
You can buy a fund.

816
00:39:08,920 --> 00:39:10,920
Called Spiltan's investment company.

817
00:39:10,920 --> 00:39:12,920
And get all of them here.

818
00:39:12,920 --> 00:39:14,920
But then it costs a fee every year.

819
00:39:14,920 --> 00:39:16,920
To own that fund.

820
00:39:16,920 --> 00:39:18,920
So it is cheaper instead to buy these investment companies

821
00:39:18,920 --> 00:39:20,920
and make "your own fund".

822
00:39:20,920 --> 00:39:22,920
Okay, one last then.

823
00:39:22,920 --> 00:39:25,920
So the investment companies are so good.

824
00:39:25,960 --> 00:39:28,960
It is that there is skills there.

825
00:39:28,960 --> 00:39:32,960
So they go into the board of the companies.

826
00:39:32,960 --> 00:39:34,960
And helps them with their skills.

827
00:39:34,960 --> 00:39:37,960
So that if you have someone from Investor.

828
00:39:37,960 --> 00:39:40,960
So they can come and control and help.

829
00:39:40,960 --> 00:39:42,960
So that the companies are moving forward.

830
00:39:42,960 --> 00:39:45,960
While funds can be more passive.

831
00:39:45,960 --> 00:39:48,960
And just own the companies.

832
00:39:48,960 --> 00:39:50,960
So that's why.

833
00:39:50,960 --> 00:39:54,960
As you said they have succeeded historically.

834
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:57,000
Thanks to his skills.

835
00:39:57,000 --> 00:40:00,000
Therefore, maybe you can expect them to continue to do so.

836
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:02,000
Yes exactly.

837
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:04,000
They go in and actively help companies.

838
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:06,000
So okay, when you have to choose shares then.

839
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:08,000
As I said first.

840
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:10,000
Start with investment companies.

841
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:12,000
Or you don't even have to choose shares first.

842
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:14,000
You can start with funds.

843
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:16,000
But then.

844
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:21,000
I think it is more important to focus on which companies should avoid.

845
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:23,000
Rather than which one should I choose.

846
00:40:23,040 --> 00:40:26,040
If you focus on which to choose.

847
00:40:26,040 --> 00:40:30,040
Then you often choose the companies that go best right now.

848
00:40:30,040 --> 00:40:33,040
But that may not be the best in the long term.

849
00:40:39,040 --> 00:40:41,040
Basically everything that contains.

850
00:40:41,040 --> 00:40:43,040
Biotech, Pharma and so on.

851
00:40:43,040 --> 00:40:46,040
Does anyone have something like that?

852
00:40:46,040 --> 00:40:48,040
Bone support

853
00:40:48,040 --> 00:40:50,040
Bone support!

854
00:40:50,040 --> 00:40:52,040
It has gone well.

855
00:40:52,080 --> 00:40:54,080
It has gone well.

856
00:40:54,080 --> 00:40:56,080
But it is also such an example.

857
00:40:56,080 --> 00:40:58,080
Where you might buy it.

858
00:40:58,080 --> 00:41:00,080
Although you do not really know exactly what they are doing.

859
00:41:00,080 --> 00:41:02,080
That's why I usually say it.

860
00:41:02,080 --> 00:41:04,080
Avoid such companies.

861
00:41:04,080 --> 00:41:07,080
Who will research and save the world.

862
00:41:07,080 --> 00:41:09,080
Through cancer and innovation.

863
00:41:09,080 --> 00:41:12,080
They often need to raise a lot of money.

864
00:41:12,080 --> 00:41:14,080
And they burn money very fast.

865
00:41:14,080 --> 00:41:19,080
Which means that the value of your shares goes down here.

866
00:41:19,080 --> 00:41:21,080
And then it will be concerning.

867
00:41:21,120 --> 00:41:23,120
Bankruptcy.

868
00:41:23,120 --> 00:41:25,120
Sometimes.

869
00:41:25,120 --> 00:41:27,120
But often it is.

870
00:41:27,120 --> 00:41:29,120
Make sure the companies make a profit.

871
00:41:29,120 --> 00:41:31,120
Very important.

872
00:41:31,120 --> 00:41:34,120
That's probably the most important thing I would say.

873
00:41:34,120 --> 00:41:36,120
Important to check it out.

874
00:41:36,120 --> 00:41:39,120
And you can do that by going to allabolag.se.

875
00:41:39,120 --> 00:41:43,120
And so you can see that the bars are green and not red.

876
00:41:43,120 --> 00:41:46,120
A simple notch.

877
00:41:46,120 --> 00:41:50,120
I will also show it at Avanza.

878
00:41:50,160 --> 00:41:52,160
Once we have finished this presentation.

879
00:41:52,160 --> 00:41:54,160
We are soon ready.

880
00:41:54,160 --> 00:41:56,160
And the last thing.

881
00:41:56,160 --> 00:42:00,160
Do not buy things that are recommended in Facebook groups.

882
00:42:00,160 --> 00:42:02,160
It's so common.

883
00:42:02,160 --> 00:42:05,160
There are so many who go into the Facebook group and write.

884
00:42:05,160 --> 00:42:07,160
What shall I buy?

885
00:42:07,160 --> 00:42:10,160
But how can we compare it then?

886
00:42:10,160 --> 00:42:12,160
It's kind of like ...

887
00:42:12,160 --> 00:42:14,160
I do not know.

888
00:42:14,160 --> 00:42:17,160
Do we have any good comparison?

889
00:42:17,200 --> 00:42:20,200
No I don't come up with anything.

890
00:42:20,200 --> 00:42:22,200
Tris lots

891
00:42:22,200 --> 00:42:24,200
Trislott, exactly.

892
00:42:26,200 --> 00:42:30,200
I just think that those who print things are looking to make money.

893
00:42:30,200 --> 00:42:32,200
Yes exactly.

894
00:42:32,200 --> 00:42:36,200
Those on Facebook groups that say buy this share.

895
00:42:36,200 --> 00:42:38,200
It is because they own it.

896
00:42:38,200 --> 00:42:40,200
They want...

897
00:42:40,200 --> 00:42:43,200
Most often it is because they have gone down so much after them.

898
00:42:43,240 --> 00:42:46,240
That they have to get people to buy it so that the price will go up again.

899
00:42:46,240 --> 00:42:48,240
So that they can get out of it a little easier.

900
00:42:48,240 --> 00:42:50,240
And not lose so much money.

901
00:42:50,240 --> 00:42:52,240
It is usually so.

902
00:42:52,240 --> 00:42:55,240
Or that they write, now comes the rocket.

903
00:42:55,240 --> 00:42:57,240
Or, now it will fly.

904
00:42:57,240 --> 00:42:59,240
It's bullshit.

905
00:42:59,240 --> 00:43:02,240
It is almost always such companies that have gone down 99 percent.

906
00:43:02,240 --> 00:43:05,240
Which people write about this.

907
00:43:05,240 --> 00:43:09,240
I can also add that if you are on such a forum.

908
00:43:09,240 --> 00:43:12,240
So there is probably some starting company that everyone is talking about.

909
00:43:12,280 --> 00:43:14,280
And these are probably high risk.

910
00:43:14,280 --> 00:43:16,280
So I can fly or it can fall.

911
00:43:16,280 --> 00:43:18,280
It's not like this, what should I buy?

912
00:43:18,280 --> 00:43:20,280
Then pull something with something boring and stable here.

913
00:43:20,280 --> 00:43:22,280
Investor.

914
00:43:22,280 --> 00:43:24,280
That's probably what to buy.

915
00:43:24,280 --> 00:43:26,280
But it may not be so fun to hear it.

916
00:43:26,280 --> 00:43:28,280
You want a clip.

917
00:43:28,280 --> 00:43:30,280
People want back dumpings.

918
00:43:30,280 --> 00:43:33,280
Hope this is the next clip that I will become a millionaire on.

919
00:43:33,280 --> 00:43:35,280
Next gamestop.

920
00:43:35,280 --> 00:43:37,280
Yes, the next gamestop.

921
00:43:37,280 --> 00:43:39,280
And we saw how it went ... It didn't go well.

922
00:43:39,280 --> 00:43:41,280
So...

923
00:43:41,320 --> 00:43:43,320
Should we see if it will continue.

924
00:43:43,320 --> 00:43:45,320
Do not buy this if 99 percent have fallen.

925
00:43:45,320 --> 00:43:48,320
There is a reason why the share has dropped 99 percent.

926
00:43:49,320 --> 00:43:51,320
And it's not because it's cheap.

927
00:43:51,320 --> 00:43:53,320
If you check SAS for example.

928
00:43:54,320 --> 00:43:56,320
Does anyone own SAS shares in here?

929
00:43:57,320 --> 00:43:59,320
Thanks, good God, for that.

930
00:44:01,320 --> 00:44:05,320
SAS CEO himself has said in the reports.

931
00:44:07,320 --> 00:44:09,320
I don't even think he owns shares in SAS.

932
00:44:09,360 --> 00:44:12,360
There will be no shareholder value left.

933
00:44:14,360 --> 00:44:16,360
So don't buy it.

934
00:44:19,360 --> 00:44:22,360
They need to raise more money and the share is diluted.

935
00:44:23,360 --> 00:44:27,360
It's the same thing, you shovel money into a burning fire.

936
00:44:28,360 --> 00:44:30,360
Buying shares in SAS right now.

937
00:44:30,360 --> 00:44:33,360
And they will be delisted and the money will disappear.

938
00:44:34,360 --> 00:44:38,360
So there are still ten thousands who have shares in SAS.

939
00:44:38,400 --> 00:44:41,400
So you know a friend who owns SAS, ask them and sell them.

940
00:44:41,400 --> 00:44:43,400
For that money will disappear.

941
00:44:46,400 --> 00:44:48,400
So that's an example.

942
00:44:48,400 --> 00:44:50,400
Okay, but some tips now.

943
00:44:51,400 --> 00:44:53,400
Some tips when buying shares.

944
00:44:54,400 --> 00:44:56,400
And this is a picture from Lundbergs.

945
00:44:56,400 --> 00:44:58,400
It is an investment company.

946
00:44:58,400 --> 00:45:01,400
So it is a graph of how I have traded in Lundbergs.

947
00:45:03,400 --> 00:45:07,400
And the green line, so it is the share price.

948
00:45:07,440 --> 00:45:10,440
How that price of it goes up and down.

949
00:45:10,440 --> 00:45:14,440
The yellow line is the average of all companies on the stock exchange.

950
00:45:14,440 --> 00:45:16,440
So you understand the difference there.

951
00:45:20,440 --> 00:45:22,440
Divide your purchases.

952
00:45:22,440 --> 00:45:26,440
So it means, if you have ten thousand SEK that you want to invest.

953
00:45:26,440 --> 00:45:28,440
But don't throw everyone in at once.

954
00:45:28,440 --> 00:45:30,440
Without here, as you can see.

955
00:45:30,440 --> 00:45:34,440
Here I have divided ten thousand SEK and buy a thousand SEK now.

956
00:45:34,440 --> 00:45:36,440
A thousand SEK tomorrow.

957
00:45:36,480 --> 00:45:37,480
Next week.

958
00:45:37,480 --> 00:45:39,480
But as you can see, things go up and down.

959
00:45:39,480 --> 00:45:40,480
I have no idea.

960
00:45:40,480 --> 00:45:42,480
You see, I bought at the top there.

961
00:45:42,480 --> 00:45:44,480
But over there.

962
00:45:44,480 --> 00:45:46,480
There I made a really good purchase.

963
00:45:46,480 --> 00:45:48,480
But I have no idea.

964
00:45:48,480 --> 00:45:51,480
I don't know when it's on top or on the bottom.

965
00:45:51,480 --> 00:45:53,480
So divide them instead.

966
00:45:53,480 --> 00:45:56,480
So that you do not go all in with a hundred thousand at once.

967
00:45:56,480 --> 00:45:58,480
When you have been inherited.

968
00:45:58,480 --> 00:46:00,480
Or a thousand.

969
00:46:01,480 --> 00:46:03,480
So I think that's good.

970
00:46:13,520 --> 00:46:17,520
And then when you see it, it is very low to watch three years to Marka.

971
00:46:17,520 --> 00:46:18,520
Just.

972
00:46:18,520 --> 00:46:21,520
Do you dare to invest so much money then?

973
00:46:21,520 --> 00:46:23,520
That's what is a good question.

974
00:46:23,520 --> 00:46:26,520
It is never easy to answer it.

975
00:46:26,520 --> 00:46:29,520
You can never know what is right and wrong with.

976
00:46:29,520 --> 00:46:31,520
There are some who look at graphs like this.

977
00:46:31,560 --> 00:46:34,560
Then when I have probably seen such ads on Instagram.

978
00:46:34,560 --> 00:46:36,560
Buy my course.

979
00:46:36,560 --> 00:46:37,560
I know.

980
00:46:37,560 --> 00:46:39,560
This share should go up.

981
00:46:39,560 --> 00:46:42,560
Become rich.
 Earn a thousand kronor in one day.

982
00:46:42,560 --> 00:46:44,560
I earned a million yesterday.

983
00:46:44,560 --> 00:46:47,560
Why are you selling a course then?

984
00:46:47,560 --> 00:46:50,560
If you are so good at knowing which shares to buy.

985
00:46:50,560 --> 00:46:51,560
I usually say.

986
00:46:51,560 --> 00:46:53,560
Take it easy.

987
00:46:53,560 --> 00:46:54,560
Instead.

988
00:46:54,560 --> 00:46:57,560
Do not try to look at graphs.

989
00:46:57,560 --> 00:47:00,560
When will it go up?
 You don't know that.

990
00:47:00,600 --> 00:47:03,600
The important thing is not to look at the graph.

991
00:47:03,600 --> 00:47:05,600
Without looking at the company.

992
00:47:05,600 --> 00:47:07,600
I know this is a bit subjective.

993
00:47:07,600 --> 00:47:09,600
Now I only show a graph.

994
00:47:09,600 --> 00:47:14,600
But we see, for example, these figures down here.

995
00:47:14,600 --> 00:47:18,600
This is something that makes people not go into shares.

996
00:47:18,600 --> 00:47:21,600
You rarely look at these p & e ratio and stuff.

997
00:47:21,600 --> 00:47:23,600
Stock market value.

998
00:47:23,600 --> 00:47:24,600
Profit per share.

999
00:47:24,600 --> 00:47:26,600
Unfortunately, we have not unlimited time today.

1000
00:47:26,600 --> 00:47:29,600
So we can't go through exactly what it means.

1001
00:47:29,640 --> 00:47:34,640
But the P & E century is a pretty good measure of companies.

1002
00:47:34,640 --> 00:47:37,640
To know if they are expensive or cheap.

1003
00:47:37,640 --> 00:47:40,640
But avoid keeping in mind that this is an exception.

1004
00:47:40,640 --> 00:47:41,640
Lundbergs.

1005
00:47:41,640 --> 00:47:44,640
At an investment company you cannot check out a P & E figure in the same way.

1006
00:47:44,640 --> 00:47:48,640
But if we were to take Nibe selling heat pumps.

1007
00:47:48,640 --> 00:47:51,640
This stands for years ...

1008
00:47:51,640 --> 00:47:52,640
How do you say now?

1009
00:47:52,640 --> 00:47:54,640
Help me Markus.

1010
00:47:54,640 --> 00:47:55,640
Award.

1011
00:47:55,640 --> 00:47:58,640
So how many years it takes until you get your investment back?

1012
00:47:58,680 --> 00:48:01,680
Exactly how many annual gains it is valued at.

1013
00:48:01,680 --> 00:48:04,680
If you were to say that this is a regular company now.

1014
00:48:04,680 --> 00:48:09,680
So you say that there are 11 annual profits that it costs to buy this stock.

1015
00:48:09,680 --> 00:48:14,680
And if the P & E century is negative, it means that they are at a loss.

1016
00:48:14,680 --> 00:48:19,680
So if you see p & e ratios, you who record write this down.

1017
00:48:19,680 --> 00:48:21,680
Because this is the most important thing you need to know.

1018
00:48:21,680 --> 00:48:25,680
If the P & E figure is negative, the company is at a loss.

1019
00:48:25,720 --> 00:48:28,720
And avoid them when you are a beginner.

1020
00:48:28,720 --> 00:48:31,720
I'm not saying buy them, not.

1021
00:48:31,720 --> 00:48:34,720
But please avoid them until you understand.

1022
00:48:34,720 --> 00:48:41,720
So p & e figure, then you often say on the Swedish stock exchange P/E 10-20.

1023
00:48:41,720 --> 00:48:44,720
It's a good valuation.

1024
00:48:44,720 --> 00:48:46,720
Or a reasonable valuation.

1025
00:48:46,720 --> 00:48:52,720
During p/e 10, then you can say that the company can be cheap.

1026
00:48:52,760 --> 00:48:56,760
And you want to buy cheaply valued shares.

1027
00:48:56,760 --> 00:48:59,760
So now it gets a little complicated here.

1028
00:48:59,760 --> 00:49:03,760
But cheaply valued has nothing to do with what the price of the share costs.

1029
00:49:03,760 --> 00:49:07,760
A share can cost a penny or a thousand SEK.

1030
00:49:07,760 --> 00:49:09,760
It does not matter.

1031
00:49:09,760 --> 00:49:14,760
You have to look at the valuation and you usually see this easily via the P/E figure.

1032
00:49:14,800 --> 00:49:22,800
And a measure to know how big the company is by looking at the market capitalization.

1033
00:49:22,800 --> 00:49:28,800
If I start a company today and cost SEK 25,000 in share capital.

1034
00:49:28,800 --> 00:49:31,800
Then I have a market capitalization of SEK 25,000.

1035
00:49:31,800 --> 00:49:38,800
Here you see Lundbergs, they have a market capitalization of SEK 119 billion.

1036
00:49:38,800 --> 00:49:41,800
So it's a little bigger.

1037
00:49:41,840 --> 00:49:44,840
Pretty big.

1038
00:49:44,840 --> 00:49:48,840
And then you get a hum if it is a small company or a large company.

1039
00:49:48,840 --> 00:49:52,840
If there is a million there in market capitalization, then it is a very small company.

1040
00:49:52,840 --> 00:49:57,840
And small companies have much higher risk than the larger established ones then.

1041
00:49:57,840 --> 00:50:00,840
Can have.

1042
00:50:00,840 --> 00:50:03,840
Will you mention interest on the interest effect?

1043
00:50:03,840 --> 00:50:06,840
No, I actually haven't included that.

1044
00:50:06,840 --> 00:50:08,840
But we can show it later.

1045
00:50:08,880 --> 00:50:11,880
Is it going well?

1046
00:50:11,880 --> 00:50:16,880
Great.

1047
00:50:16,880 --> 00:50:21,880
We can pick it up later.

1048
00:50:23,880 --> 00:50:26,880
Okay, more tips then!

1049
00:50:26,880 --> 00:50:28,880
Now we have come in on valuation.

1050
00:50:28,880 --> 00:50:30,880
Don't panic when something crashes.

1051
00:50:30,880 --> 00:50:33,880
Read on before acting.

1052
00:50:33,920 --> 00:50:38,920
That is, when Hexatronic falls by 33 percent as it did today.

1053
00:50:38,920 --> 00:50:43,920
First, think why do it and then think about.

1054
00:50:43,920 --> 00:50:46,920
Should I sell or not?

1055
00:50:46,920 --> 00:50:49,920
And then the long -term perspective was the most important thing.

1056
00:50:49,920 --> 00:50:51,920
Just as you said, interest on the interest effect.

1057
00:50:51,920 --> 00:50:56,920
When you buy shares, do so for at least three to five years ahead.

1058
00:50:56,920 --> 00:51:01,920
So when you invest, think so far ahead.

1059
00:51:01,960 --> 00:51:05,960
So that you do not think that after a week I should sell.

1060
00:51:05,960 --> 00:51:11,960
For the longer you wait the greater the likelihood that you actually make money.

1061
00:51:13,960 --> 00:51:16,960
We do not have many slides left.

1062
00:51:16,960 --> 00:51:19,960
And now we come up to funds.

1063
00:51:19,960 --> 00:51:22,960
A little quick ice cream, it's the last here now.

1064
00:51:22,960 --> 00:51:26,960
And then I show this particular fund that you talked about.

1065
00:51:26,960 --> 00:51:28,960
Spiltan equity fund investment company.

1066
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:32,000
So we talked about investment companies before.

1067
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:37,000
And not to make it too confusing with the game, this is a fund then.

1068
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:42,000
The game itself is also an investment company.

1069
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:47,000
But this fund invests in investment companies.

1070
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:54,000
So, for example, here you see that for five years each month and even more often I have bought in it.

1071
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:56,000
And I think that is great.

1072
00:51:56,040 --> 00:51:59,040
It is the small saver's best friend for everyone in here who has not invested.

1073
00:51:59,040 --> 00:52:01,040
Start in funds.

1074
00:52:01,040 --> 00:52:04,040
Then you can save, for example, Avanza a penny.

1075
00:52:04,040 --> 00:52:07,040
Maybe a hundred kronor per month.

1076
00:52:09,040 --> 00:52:13,040
And then you spread the risk in several other companies.

1077
00:52:13,040 --> 00:52:16,040
But it's not just the best friend of the small saver.

1078
00:52:16,040 --> 00:52:18,040
It is also the bank's cashier.

1079
00:52:18,040 --> 00:52:20,040
Just as you mentioned.

1080
00:52:20,040 --> 00:52:25,040
After all, there are funds that banks make a lot of money from.

1081
00:52:25,080 --> 00:52:27,080
And that is through fees then.

1082
00:52:27,080 --> 00:52:29,080
And we get that right away.

1083
00:52:29,080 --> 00:52:34,080
But when you save in funds, set up an automatic monthly savings.

1084
00:52:34,080 --> 00:52:37,080
So that you go in and choose monthly.

1085
00:52:37,080 --> 00:52:41,080
And then it is every month that is drawn with direct debit.

1086
00:52:41,080 --> 00:52:44,080
Directly when the salary comes, you buy for a hundred SEK a month.

1087
00:52:44,080 --> 00:52:46,080
Two hundred kronor, five hundred kronor.

1088
00:52:46,080 --> 00:52:48,080
As much as you can afford.

1089
00:52:48,080 --> 00:52:52,080
Because as you said with interest on the interest effect.

1090
00:52:52,120 --> 00:52:56,120
Over time, there will be a lot of money.

1091
00:53:00,120 --> 00:53:03,120
My monthly savings looks like this.

1092
00:53:03,120 --> 00:53:05,120
Two thousand SEK a month.

1093
00:53:05,120 --> 00:53:09,120
In Swedish funds, global funds and small company funds.

1094
00:53:10,120 --> 00:53:13,120
I would have liked to go through more about funds.

1095
00:53:13,120 --> 00:53:16,120
But unfortunately I don't have time for that.

1096
00:53:17,120 --> 00:53:19,120
There is more to read.

1097
00:53:19,160 --> 00:53:21,160
But there is a lot of info.

1098
00:53:21,160 --> 00:53:23,160
Everything is available on my website sparecash.se

1099
00:53:23,160 --> 00:53:27,160
So when you want, if you are going to set up a monthly saving.

1100
00:53:27,160 --> 00:53:29,160
Don't make it harder than it is.

1101
00:53:29,160 --> 00:53:31,160
And choose a Swedish fund.

1102
00:53:31,160 --> 00:53:34,160
And choose a global fund.

1103
00:53:36,160 --> 00:53:38,160
It is enough.

1104
00:53:38,160 --> 00:53:41,160
It is not needed more than that.

1105
00:53:41,160 --> 00:53:45,160
And then please choose a cheap fund.

1106
00:53:45,160 --> 00:53:48,160
And then I have written avoid these funds.

1107
00:53:48,200 --> 00:53:51,200
Then I do not mean specifically this fund

1108
00:53:51,200 --> 00:53:55,200
Without some benchmarks.

1109
00:53:55,200 --> 00:54:00,200
I have funds that cost more than one percent per year.

1110
00:54:00,200 --> 00:54:04,200
But try when you are new to avoid them.

1111
00:54:04,200 --> 00:54:07,200
Until you know if they are worth that fee.

1112
00:54:08,200 --> 00:54:11,200
So benchmarks, avoid funds with one percent in fee and up.

1113
00:54:11,200 --> 00:54:13,200
Fund in fund solutions.

1114
00:54:13,200 --> 00:54:16,200
This means that the fund has funds in itself.

1115
00:54:16,240 --> 00:54:19,240
If you are on the Avanza app or on your computer.

1116
00:54:19,240 --> 00:54:21,240
So you can scroll down a bit.

1117
00:54:21,240 --> 00:54:23,240
Under the fund and then you see the holdings

1118
00:54:23,240 --> 00:54:26,240
And there are a lot of funds in there.

1119
00:54:26,240 --> 00:54:29,240
I hope no one works at Maxmathiessen or Söderberg Partners.

1120
00:54:29,240 --> 00:54:32,240
But they have a tendency to do.

1121
00:54:32,240 --> 00:54:35,240
They have a tendency to buy funds in their funds.

1122
00:54:35,240 --> 00:54:38,240
Which means you receive a fee on the fee.

1123
00:54:38,240 --> 00:54:40,240
So you pay a double fee.

1124
00:54:40,240 --> 00:54:42,240
And also in the pension for example.

1125
00:54:42,280 --> 00:54:46,280
So it may be that you have a fee for the entire pension savings.

1126
00:54:46,280 --> 00:54:48,280
So you who have an occupational pension.

1127
00:54:48,280 --> 00:54:50,280
Check out your occupational pensions.

1128
00:54:50,280 --> 00:54:52,280
There may be very hidden fees.

1129
00:54:52,280 --> 00:54:54,280
Which you don't think about.

1130
00:54:56,280 --> 00:54:58,280
If you don't know what you are doing.

1131
00:55:00,280 --> 00:55:03,280
Avoid funds that have been best in 2023.

1132
00:55:03,280 --> 00:55:05,280
It's pretty common.

1133
00:55:05,280 --> 00:55:07,280
I know there is a lot of traffic on my article.

1134
00:55:07,280 --> 00:55:09,280
Called the best funds 2023.

1135
00:55:09,280 --> 00:55:11,280
There is a reason why I baptized it.

1136
00:55:11,320 --> 00:55:14,320
Because people like to click on it.

1137
00:55:14,320 --> 00:55:17,320
But funds that have gone best this year.

1138
00:55:17,320 --> 00:55:22,320
Has no guarantee that they will be the best next year.

1139
00:55:22,320 --> 00:55:25,320
Without this is an example of such a fund.

1140
00:55:25,320 --> 00:55:27,320
Which did not go best this year.

1141
00:55:27,320 --> 00:55:29,320
But previous years.

1142
00:55:29,320 --> 00:55:31,320
As you can see in five years, it has gone 101 percent.

1143
00:55:33,320 --> 00:55:35,320
But this year it has backed 20 percent.

1144
00:55:37,320 --> 00:55:39,320
Hedge funds I also say that you should avoid.

1145
00:55:39,360 --> 00:55:41,360
It's a bit complicated.

1146
00:55:41,360 --> 00:55:45,360
And fixed income funds if you are long -term, I think you should avoid.

1147
00:55:45,360 --> 00:55:47,360
If you save in 10-20 years term.

1148
00:55:47,360 --> 00:55:50,360
So you won't get that much return with fixed income funds.

1149
00:55:50,360 --> 00:55:52,360
But it also depends on.

1150
00:55:52,360 --> 00:55:54,360
I'm not saying don't use fixed income funds.

1151
00:55:54,360 --> 00:55:56,360
But myself for my long -term savings avoids it.

1152
00:55:56,360 --> 00:55:58,360
Because I want to get as much return as possible.

1153
00:56:00,360 --> 00:56:02,360
And what I meant by this fund.

1154
00:56:02,360 --> 00:56:04,360
Now I have a picture.

1155
00:56:04,360 --> 00:56:06,360
Why I mean to avoid them.

1156
00:56:06,400 --> 00:56:08,400
One should avoid those who have gone best.

1157
00:56:12,400 --> 00:56:14,400
If you see the difference between these two.

1158
00:56:18,400 --> 00:56:20,400
So you see here now that I've taken from the top.

1159
00:56:20,400 --> 00:56:22,400
2022-08-10.

1160
00:56:22,400 --> 00:56:24,400
Until today.

1161
00:56:24,400 --> 00:56:26,400
So it has backed 30-31 percent.

1162
00:56:30,400 --> 00:56:32,400
But the stock market that is yellow.

1163
00:56:32,400 --> 00:56:34,400
Located basically plus minus zero.

1164
00:56:34,440 --> 00:56:36,440
So if you had gone for 2021.

1165
00:56:36,440 --> 00:56:38,440
Or what it was when this one went really well.

1166
00:56:38,440 --> 00:56:40,440
And pushed in 100,000.

1167
00:56:40,440 --> 00:56:42,440
Because this fund went so well.

1168
00:56:42,440 --> 00:56:44,440
So you had been back 30 percent today.

1169
00:56:46,440 --> 00:56:48,440
It is very common for people to do so.

1170
00:56:48,440 --> 00:56:50,440
You buy the fund that has gone best.

1171
00:56:50,440 --> 00:56:52,440
And then you think it will continue to go well.

1172
00:56:52,440 --> 00:56:54,440
And then it just gets pancake

1173
00:56:56,440 --> 00:56:58,440
Like when buying Tesla.

1174
00:57:00,440 --> 00:57:02,440
Yes Tesla is a classic.

1175
00:57:02,480 --> 00:57:04,480
Yes.

1176
00:57:04,480 --> 00:57:06,480
That's all I had.
 Super good.

1177
00:57:06,480 --> 00:57:08,480
Now I can switch to questions.

1178
00:57:08,480 --> 00:57:10,480
So I say thank you for your time.

1179
00:57:10,480 --> 00:57:12,480
And then I go over to questions.

1180
00:57:12,480 --> 00:57:14,480
And if you want to check out my youtube.

1181
00:57:14,480 --> 00:57:16,480
So just scan this code.

1182
00:57:16,480 --> 00:57:18,480
And we have time.

1183
00:57:18,480 --> 00:57:20,480
So I can also go in and check out my corporate portfolio at Avanza

1184
00:57:20,480 --> 00:57:22,480
Thanks.
