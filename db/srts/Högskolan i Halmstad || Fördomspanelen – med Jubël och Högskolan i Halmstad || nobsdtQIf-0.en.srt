1
00:00:11,700 --> 00:00:13,400
Well, we are Jubël.

2
00:00:13,600 --> 00:00:17,733
Fun that you have found here.
 Today we will talk prejudice about Halmstad-

3
00:00:17,800 --> 00:00:20,133
-The student life in Halmstad and University.

4
00:00:20,133 --> 00:00:22,400
Welcome here.
 Who do we have in front of us?

5
00:00:23,100 --> 00:00:26,866
My name is Fannie Andersson and I study as a sports psychologist.

6
00:00:27,066 --> 00:00:28,860
Right now I'm in the second year.

7
00:00:29,060 --> 00:00:30,400
My name is Timmie.

8
00:00:30,566 --> 00:00:34,533
I plug in business economics at the master's level here-

9
00:00:34,730 --> 00:00:37,933
-and I've just started my third semester.

10
00:00:38,600 --> 00:00:39,600
My name is Elin.

11
00:00:39,620 --> 00:00:43,400
I read my third and last year on the business system program.

12
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:45,133
Who are we, then?

13
00:00:45,460 --> 00:00:47,500
- Victor is my name.
 - Seebastian is my name.

14
00:00:47,566 --> 00:00:51,200
We are also Jubël - music duo from Halmstad.

15
00:00:51,833 --> 00:00:54,733
Born and raised in this wonderful city.

16
00:00:55,366 --> 00:00:58,766
And we are here today for us to run some prejudice.

17
00:00:58,930 --> 00:01:01,066
We're starting the first question, I guess.

18
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:02,400
Are you ready?

19
00:01:03,100 --> 00:01:04,100
I think so.

20
00:01:04,200 --> 00:01:05,666
Throw some jingle here.

21
00:01:06,500 --> 00:01:08,133
Students do only three things-

22
00:01:08,633 --> 00:01:11,100
-Plugs, partying and gym.

23
00:01:13,300 --> 00:01:16,066
- Otherwise, that's not wrong.
 -No, it is not.

24
00:01:16,630 --> 00:01:19,466
- It sounds like student life.
 - Yes, that sounds wonderful.

25
00:01:19,760 --> 00:01:22,266
It's kind of a clock that always goes around.

26
00:01:22,300 --> 00:01:25,830
It's probably also because we have so many gyms here in Halmstad.

27
00:01:26,366 --> 00:01:29,266
After all, there are almost as many gyms as pizzerias.

28
00:01:29,733 --> 00:01:32,560
Most people who are studying at the university are from Halmstad.

29
00:01:32,630 --> 00:01:37,766
Since I go for a master's program, I only have international classmates.

30
00:01:39,033 --> 00:01:42,200
So I plug with classmates from all over the world.

31
00:01:42,533 --> 00:01:44,466
-International.
 -Really.

32
00:01:44,866 --> 00:01:51,866
It is one from Halmstad, we are 3-4 pieces from Sweden-

33
00:01:52,033 --> 00:01:58,433
-And then we have Europeans, some from Asia and from South America.

34
00:01:58,533 --> 00:01:59,533
Exciting.

35
00:01:59,866 --> 00:02:02,930
It is only played Per Gessle at the pre -parties.

36
00:02:02,930 --> 00:02:05,800
–... and Jubël.
 -Exactly.

37
00:02:06,633 --> 00:02:08,166
-No.
 -Not?

38
00:02:09,033 --> 00:02:11,133
Jubël maybe, but not Per Gessle.

39
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:15,666
- It's not my ... - plus points.
 Continue like that.

40
00:02:16,260 --> 00:02:18,666
There is no student life in Halmstad.

41
00:02:18,900 --> 00:02:19,900
Is it true?

42
00:02:20,100 --> 00:02:21,000
Absolutely not.

43
00:02:21,500 --> 00:02:24,933
It may not look the same as in the big student cities-

44
00:02:25,166 --> 00:02:28,233
-But we have two student pubs.

45
00:02:28,433 --> 00:02:30,233
-Tell me more.
 Where is that?
 -Exactly.

46
00:02:32,966 --> 00:02:37,733
It is Lilla Smålands, which is located in a small basement at Nyhem.

47
00:02:38,633 --> 00:02:40,700
-Still.
 - Frightened, after all.

48
00:02:41,133 --> 00:02:43,700
Then we have our big student pub Little heart-

49
00:02:43,700 --> 00:02:47,033
-while driven by the student union.

50
00:02:47,366 --> 00:02:50,266
It feels like the students have a secret life.

51
00:02:50,566 --> 00:02:51,700
-Yes.
 - Yes, a little so.

52
00:02:52,100 --> 00:02:56,460
As a non-student, it doesn't feel like there are so many students in town.

53
00:02:56,460 --> 00:03:00,740
- No, we stick to our pubs.
 - With your community.

54
00:03:00,766 --> 00:03:02,300
So don't get there and ruin.

55
00:03:03,166 --> 00:03:06,833
I think it has to do with campus being outside.

56
00:03:07,660 --> 00:03:12,133
It is not outside town, but it is not in the center-

57
00:03:12,300 --> 00:03:15,160
-Or you have it a little south.

58
00:03:15,160 --> 00:03:20,366
And then it becomes like the bubble we live in ports in that direction.

59
00:03:20,630 --> 00:03:22,480
This side of the railway, so to speak.

60
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:25,560
And you do not want to put 300 bucks on entry.

61
00:03:25,833 --> 00:03:28,300
-No.
 - No, that's right.

62
00:03:29,100 --> 00:03:31,500
If you cog your first exam you will be turned off.

63
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,300
-No.
 -No.

64
00:03:33,566 --> 00:03:35,100
But many are probably afraid of that-

65
00:03:35,100 --> 00:03:38,000
-If I first coach I will never do this.

66
00:03:38,100 --> 00:03:40,110
- Is it more a matter of setting?
 -Yes.

67
00:03:40,133 --> 00:03:41,630
Have you cogged?

68
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,300
-Not yet.
 -Yes.

69
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:45,233
-Not yet.
 —Mixed.

70
00:03:45,366 --> 00:03:47,000
Okay.

71
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,833
- But God ... - it does well.

72
00:03:49,850 --> 00:03:52,000
You come directly from high school-

73
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:55,900
-And then it is not uncommon to pass all the tests right away.

74
00:03:55,930 --> 00:03:57,800
But it's a completely different thing here.

75
00:03:57,800 --> 00:04:00,133
There are much larger tasks and tentor-

76
00:04:00,466 --> 00:04:04,033
-So you are not really prepared for that kind of test.

77
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:07,060
But it's totally okay to cog an exam.

78
00:04:07,060 --> 00:04:09,400
You are not suspended and sent home.

79
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:10,630
You plug in.

80
00:04:10,630 --> 00:04:13,900
Maybe an angry text message from mom saying: now you have not plugged-

81
00:04:13,900 --> 00:04:16,033
-And then you say: No, I haven't.

82
00:04:17,933 --> 00:04:22,700
You must have a green card in golf to get people to record you in Halmstad.

83
00:04:22,700 --> 00:04:25,480
I really don't hope so, because then I'm run.

84
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:27,000
Then I have to move.

85
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,500
Is it a lot of golf talk?

86
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:31,910
Now you did not have many with Halmstad connection.

87
00:04:31,930 --> 00:04:34,530
No, but many in my class play golf.

88
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,530
Halmstad is a golf city.

89
00:04:36,530 --> 00:04:39,030
Yes, there is a lot of talk about it.

90
00:04:39,030 --> 00:04:42,166
But now it has almost become more frisbee golf in the summer.

91
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:44,660
Yes, it has become a thing, I have seen.

92
00:04:44,660 --> 00:04:45,866
What about paddle then?

93
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:49,266
Oh, all students have probably tried it at some point.

94
00:04:49,400 --> 00:04:53,466
- We tested it.
 - We talked about booking another.

95
00:04:53,900 --> 00:04:58,633
You have complexes not to be as old and rich as Lund University.

96
00:04:59,533 --> 00:05:00,300
Is that so?

97
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:04,000
-No.
 - No, so we ...

98
00:05:04,866 --> 00:05:08,230
Halmstad will never be Lund, and is not Lund-

99
00:05:08,230 --> 00:05:09,733
-And we don't want to be Lund.

100
00:05:10,533 --> 00:05:13,600
All bikes in Halmstad, regardless of the weather or wind.

101
00:05:14,366 --> 00:05:16,100
How else should you get there?

102
00:05:17,466 --> 00:05:18,460
Not a bus?

103
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:23,466
- Is there no buses?
 - It's so close so it's unnecessary.

104
00:05:24,700 --> 00:05:27,666
You still live at the far end.

105
00:05:27,833 --> 00:05:31,360
Yes, it takes me 7 minutes to cycle.

106
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:32,200
Where do you live?

107
00:05:32,666 --> 00:05:35,200
About at the City Library.

108
00:05:36,700 --> 00:05:40,433
There is no distance and this is missing now that we have moved from here.

109
00:05:40,633 --> 00:05:43,200
It is a damn mecca with collective here and there.

110
00:05:43,433 --> 00:05:46,660
I imagine it is so in larger cities.

111
00:05:46,660 --> 00:05:48,530
It is a project wherever you go.

112
00:05:48,530 --> 00:05:50,066
I miss my bike.

113
00:05:50,233 --> 00:05:52,300
- You have bought a new bike.
 -Yes.

114
00:05:52,300 --> 00:05:53,466
Cycle on it.

115
00:05:54,033 --> 00:05:55,600
When the college comes on speech-

116
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:58,633
-Can you don't stop boasting about how good looking and cool the school is.

117
00:05:58,830 --> 00:06:01,900
- We said that before.
 - Yes, it's very nice.

118
00:06:03,266 --> 00:06:06,700
I think many people get stuck for the big tower - Trade Center.

119
00:06:06,833 --> 00:06:08,433
That it is visible everywhere-

120
00:06:08,633 --> 00:06:14,360
-And it is the more modern thinking with glazed.

121
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:17,400
But does it have anything to do with the university?

122
00:06:17,733 --> 00:06:22,560
The campus area is an area that not only consists of the university.

123
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:25,400
We take the majority of places here-

124
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:31,533
-But there are small businesses and the Trade Center is a place for different companies.

125
00:06:31,733 --> 00:06:40,133
But we as students may be lucky to have lessons and other things in the Trade Center.

126
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:43,133
- You have to drink alcohol during zeroing.
 -No.

127
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:45,500
You really don't have to.

128
00:06:45,660 --> 00:06:46,933
But many people think so.

129
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:49,800
It is because that is what is in all articles.

130
00:06:49,933 --> 00:06:53,700
Yes, but Halmstad's zeroing is not like zeroing in other cities.

131
00:06:55,100 --> 00:06:58,400
I have been in x number of different cities-

132
00:06:58,666 --> 00:07:02,960
-And was surprised when I came to Halmstad and didn't get a beer in hand-

133
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:07,200
-What we drive sober and have kind of soda in the days.

134
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:09,980
Late in the evening there is a party if you want.

135
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,500
Feels spontaneously really sensible.

136
00:07:12,500 --> 00:07:17,000
Yes, it's fun to get to know their classmates in sober state-

137
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,433
-But still under zero.

138
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:23,466
If you are over 28, you are too old to study at college.

139
00:07:24,100 --> 00:07:25,100
No.

140
00:07:26,633 --> 00:07:28,466
No, I really don't think so.

141
00:07:29,266 --> 00:07:34,366
We have one that is 32 in our class and he fits perfectly.

142
00:07:35,066 --> 00:07:38,433
Sure, we are very young in our class- 97s, 98: or-

143
00:07:38,833 --> 00:07:43,300
-It's some 94s, but then he comes and raises and is 32.

144
00:07:43,533 --> 00:07:46,430
No matter how old you are, you can always start over.

145
00:07:46,430 --> 00:07:48,830
You should always find what you want to do yourself.

146
00:07:48,830 --> 00:07:50,630
Who is the oldest who goes to school?

147
00:07:51,166 --> 00:07:55,033
- Oh, there is ... — it must be some record.

148
00:07:55,700 --> 00:08:02,433
There are, after all, the courses that provide a professional degree, such as teachers-

149
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:08,333
-And nurse, and I think they have a higher average age.

150
00:08:08,933 --> 00:08:09,960
It is not to late.

151
00:08:09,960 --> 00:08:13,633
There must be some record on it.
 Someone who is 65 or 70.

152
00:08:13,933 --> 00:08:16,300
After all, there is a limit to when you can take CSN.

153
00:08:16,433 --> 00:08:19,400
I think it's just before retirement.

154
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:21,600
Switch over from CSN to retirement.

155
00:08:23,033 --> 00:08:25,160
There are re -exams but no surrounding parties.

156
00:08:25,160 --> 00:08:25,833
Yeah.

157
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:31,266
- For us who cog exams, so.
 -Thanks.

158
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:34,833
- Unfortunately, I couldn't stop it.
 - No, okay.

159
00:08:35,230 --> 00:08:38,766
The thing is well that I say that you have to value it-

160
00:08:38,900 --> 00:08:42,060
-If you should be diplomatic in saying that was the way it was.

161
00:08:42,060 --> 00:08:46,160
Yes, you might not go out to cog, because you want to party-

162
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:47,700
-But the possibility.

163
00:08:47,700 --> 00:08:51,600
Has it been so ever that it has been a party, but you have to plug-

164
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:52,866
-But shit the same -now we drive.

165
00:08:53,100 --> 00:08:54,466
I combine it then.

166
00:08:54,930 --> 00:08:56,400
You bring the book with you then?

167
00:08:56,433 --> 00:08:57,900
- Yeah.
 -How?

168
00:08:58,100 --> 00:09:00,800
- It's great.
 –I have been sitting evening-

169
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:03,966
-What you should go out, so I-sits-

170
00:09:04,966 --> 00:09:08,166
-Then we are a bunch that has a small party.

171
00:09:08,566 --> 00:09:14,930
Then I spontaneously get some help too, when you have a submission.

172
00:09:14,930 --> 00:09:20,633
And the faster you have written it clearly, the faster you can move on.

173
00:09:21,900 --> 00:09:26,230
Then you can't determine the quality of this.

174
00:09:26,230 --> 00:09:30,230
Then you see on the paper that it starts well, but then it is just ...

175
00:09:30,230 --> 00:09:32,360
- It is lucky that we have computers.
 -Yes.

176
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:35,300
It starts with writing style, as the first time you wrote ...

177
00:09:35,300 --> 00:09:38,540
It's been a long time since he went to school.
 He only wrote on paper.

178
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:41,200
It is not possible to understand the Dutch dialect.

179
00:09:41,860 --> 00:09:44,300
Then we could not have this discussion.

180
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:45,400
No, exactly.

181
00:09:45,500 --> 00:09:48,100
- You are still the farthest from here.
 - Do you understand us?

182
00:09:48,100 --> 00:09:51,430
Yes, yes, it was difficult in the beginning.
 I still have to say that.

183
00:09:51,450 --> 00:09:54,400
But those who come from Skåne speak so mushy so ...

184
00:09:55,266 --> 00:09:56,600
Yes, but that's something else.

185
00:09:56,666 --> 00:09:58,200
Halmstad is a mix there.

186
00:09:58,200 --> 00:10:02,560
Yes, but they swing on the words all the time when they talk.

187
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:05,000
It was difficult to understand in the beginning.

188
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,166
But, don't you think so?

189
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:09,730
-I do not think so.
 -No?

190
00:10:09,730 --> 00:10:12,333
They Joddles Fram: Servant.

191
00:10:13,933 --> 00:10:15,433
Students only eat noodles.

192
00:10:15,933 --> 00:10:16,833
-No.
 -No.

193
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,500
- Food boxes.
 - Food boxes with noodles ...

194
00:10:19,500 --> 00:10:20,500
...just kidding.

195
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,633
Do you have any budget?

196
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:24,800
Do you go after the cheapest?

197
00:10:24,960 --> 00:10:29,200
When you see spaghetti, do you take the cheapest kind?

198
00:10:29,466 --> 00:10:32,433
- Or you go too little ... - no, I always think about taste.

199
00:10:32,660 --> 00:10:34,790
It is no idea to eat if it is not good.

200
00:10:34,810 --> 00:10:37,360
- a little so ... - quality over quantity.

201
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:38,300
Very good.

202
00:10:40,266 --> 00:10:43,033
In Halmstad there are more gyms than grocery stores.

203
00:10:44,233 --> 00:10:48,133
-Yes.
 - If you count on it, it certainly does.

204
00:10:48,500 --> 00:10:51,733
Students drink more coffee than water in a day.

205
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:53,866
- Is it a lot of coffee?

206
00:10:53,880 --> 00:10:56,360
I look at you two because I don't drink coffee.

207
00:10:56,400 --> 00:10:58,133
- Coffee, type.
 -Yes.

208
00:10:58,566 --> 00:11:00,166
I've gone down now.

209
00:11:00,566 --> 00:11:03,400
I went from 10 cups to type 3.

210
00:11:03,566 --> 00:11:06,633
--Wow!
 - It's still strong.

211
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:10,466
–10 cups.
 - Yes, it is almost heart attack.

212
00:11:11,160 --> 00:11:15,866
I had a week when I tried, when I locked myself.

213
00:11:15,900 --> 00:11:17,730
Nobody wanted to be with me right then.

214
00:11:18,233 --> 00:11:19,566
Yes, but ...

215
00:11:19,666 --> 00:11:22,100
- There will be some cups in one day.
 - Yes, it will be.

216
00:11:22,120 --> 00:11:23,933
It was the last prejudice we had.

217
00:11:24,030 --> 00:11:25,433
What have we learned today?

218
00:11:25,560 --> 00:11:28,300
We have learned that there are more gyms than pizzerias.

219
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:32,033
Everyone in Halmstad plays paddle.
 Golf is no longer relevant.

220
00:11:32,166 --> 00:11:33,700
Paddle and muscles.

221
00:11:34,433 --> 00:11:38,633
And there is a nice community between all students.

222
00:11:38,633 --> 00:11:40,630
I thought it was nice.

223
00:11:41,566 --> 00:11:43,000
This was everything from us.

224
00:11:43,020 --> 00:11:44,360
We are Jubël.

225
00:11:44,360 --> 00:11:47,110
We hope you thought this was fun and educational.

226
00:11:47,133 --> 00:11:49,333
- students - out in life.
 -Thanks.
