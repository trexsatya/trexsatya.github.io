1
00:00:04,260 --> 00:00:07,740
- These make you sweaty.
- I felt that.

2
00:00:07,840 --> 00:00:09,740
- Zero, zero, zero.
- Zero, zero, zero.

3
00:00:18,540 --> 00:00:21,060
Hey, hey!

4
00:00:21,200 --> 00:00:25,960
Today we are trying candy
from Finland!

5
00:00:26,100 --> 00:00:29,520
Where they invent things.

6
00:00:29,680 --> 00:00:31,680
Oh? Maybe so.

7
00:00:31,680 --> 00:00:40,460
In our latest "Opening mail"-video we received
Finnish candy by a kind viewer in Finland, named Ingrid.

8
00:00:40,660 --> 00:00:45,420
She asked if we wanted to try
Finnish candy, and we said "Yes!".

9
00:00:45,540 --> 00:00:54,040
Shortly thereafter,
this showed up with "Posti".

10
00:00:54,680 --> 00:00:57,960
Here's a letter!

11
00:00:58,140 --> 00:01:09,260
This package, full of Finnish candy, was sent to us from
Liam and Tindra, and their parents Sabrina and Robert.

12
00:01:09,440 --> 00:01:14,700
They live in Ekenäs in Finland,
and they want us to try this Finnish candy.

13
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:19,280
- Of course we will.
- So fun! Are you ready?

14
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:21,460
- Yes!
- Yes! Let's go.

15
00:01:21,620 --> 00:01:23,860
"Pantteri - Sour Cat"

16
00:01:24,140 --> 00:01:29,280
It's jelly candies
shaped like panther faces.

17
00:01:29,500 --> 00:01:33,400
- Do we just pick a color each?
- I'll try this yellow one.

18
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:35,880
- I'll try a pink one.
- I'll try this one.

19
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:39,300
- Orange. What's left for me?
- Green or black.

20
00:01:39,300 --> 00:01:41,720
I'll try a green one.

21
00:01:41,720 --> 00:01:43,300
- Ready?
- Yes.

22
00:01:43,300 --> 00:01:46,660
1, 2, 3...

23
00:01:53,060 --> 00:02:00,080
- Fruity. Quite sweet, not that sour.
- No! "Sour Cat" - I don't think it's that sour.

24
00:02:02,300 --> 00:02:05,720
Harry seems to like it.

25
00:02:06,180 --> 00:02:09,220
No, Harry...

26
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:15,640
- He's doing the... "flappity-flap man".
- Help! What does this mean?

27
00:02:15,640 --> 00:02:18,680
- Scatman?
- I don't know.

28
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:22,780
- I flew away.
- You flew away. Was it that good?

29
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:27,880
- Don't smack. The viewers go crazy.
- Oh, sorry.

30
00:02:28,020 --> 00:02:32,100
We get comments about that
every time we try candy.

31
00:02:32,100 --> 00:02:38,340
If our smacking annoys you, I'm really sorry.
It's difficult to avoid.

32
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:43,800
How many points
do you give it from 1-5?

33
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:46,340
Harry first.

34
00:02:46,540 --> 00:02:49,400
- 4.
- 5+.

35
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:54,420
- 5+, wow. 3.5.
- 3.

36
00:02:54,700 --> 00:02:55,880
"Suffeli"

37
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:59,260
It's a chocolate dipped wafer.

38
00:03:03,460 --> 00:03:06,980
Oh, there's caramel in it.

39
00:03:06,980 --> 00:03:13,020
- It just tastes like "Kexchoklad". (a chocolate wafer)
- Nice! I've had so many boring wafer-candies.

40
00:03:13,020 --> 00:03:20,900
- It's much better than "Kexchoklad", Harry.
- And much better than the wafers in bags. Really good.

41
00:03:22,100 --> 00:03:26,500
- There's something white in here too.
- That's banana-mallow-mallow, or something.

42
00:03:26,620 --> 00:03:32,720
From 1-5, I think...

43
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:39,180
Maybe... Let me think.

44
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:41,300
Two fives.

45
00:03:41,300 --> 00:03:43,700
- Two fives?
- Yes.

46
00:03:43,860 --> 00:03:48,760
I think 5+, again.
I think it was so good!

47
00:03:48,920 --> 00:03:53,020
- Yes. Me too.
- Me too. I give it 5 points.

48
00:03:53,160 --> 00:03:55,360
I give it 4 points.

49
00:03:55,420 --> 00:03:58,100
- Almost a "full potter".
- Almost.

50
00:03:58,100 --> 00:04:00,360
A potter?

51
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:05,860
- It's a saying. (full score)
- Oh, I thought you meant a full potty.

52
00:04:05,860 --> 00:04:09,900
- "Almost a full potty". No.
- No, absolutely no full potty.

53
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:14,720
Don't forget to hit the thumbs up button
if you like when we try candy.

54
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:16,500
"Pepe"

55
00:04:16,660 --> 00:04:19,300
It's a soft licorice stick.

56
00:04:19,520 --> 00:04:25,240
I ate these when I was a kid, it's delicious.
Well, I thought so back then. It's sweet licorice.

57
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:28,880
- Eww...
- It's super good!

58
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:32,960
It looks like
the world's longest cigarette.

59
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:39,620
- Cigarettes aren't usually black.
- And you don't usually blow in them.

60
00:04:46,640 --> 00:04:51,220
- Good texture on licorice.
- Super good.

61
00:04:51,220 --> 00:04:54,480
Hey you!

62
00:04:55,180 --> 00:04:59,100
Don't try it, Harry.

63
00:05:02,280 --> 00:05:05,520
Awesome, Harry. Good job.

64
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:11,960
I mean... what's wrong with you guys?

65
00:05:14,940 --> 00:05:21,700
It sounds like he's spitting down my neck - he's not.
There's a sink back there.

66
00:05:23,540 --> 00:05:29,400
How can you not like sweet licorice?

67
00:05:30,680 --> 00:05:34,600
- It's delicious.
- I think so too.

68
00:05:34,820 --> 00:05:42,200
I don't like licorice because it's
black, gross, sticky, long...

69
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:44,880
Oh, a hiccup.

70
00:05:45,140 --> 00:05:46,460
It's gross!

71
00:05:46,460 --> 00:05:54,140
I don't like licorice because it's
salty and sweet all in one, and it's a "biter" and...

72
00:05:54,140 --> 00:06:00,080
- "Biter"?!
- A biter flavor, I wonder what that is.

73
00:06:00,260 --> 00:06:03,760
You haven't understood
the good things in life.

74
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:11,540
Or maybe a slimy snail
mixed with black pudding.

75
00:06:11,740 --> 00:06:15,320
Is it just our kids
that don't like licorice?

76
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:25,340
Do your children like licorice? Or if you are a child,
do you like licorice or not? Please comment below.

77
00:06:25,340 --> 00:06:28,180
- Comment.
- Please do. A lot.

- I give it 4 points.
- I give it 2 points.

84
00:06:50,100 --> 00:06:52,500
"Maxi Pätkis Crunchy"

85
00:06:52,660 --> 00:06:55,760
It's a crunchy chocolate bar.

86
00:06:59,980 --> 00:07:04,340
- Oh, mint...
- Yes. Mint, yummy.

87
00:07:04,540 --> 00:07:07,120
Mm, it was pretty good.

88
00:07:11,080 --> 00:07:17,920
- It could've been so much tastier.
- Mm, if it wasn't minty.

89
00:07:18,520 --> 00:07:27,780
I agree, but not because of the mint.
It was alright, but the texture wasn't very fun.

90
00:07:27,940 --> 00:07:30,700
Where's he going? Oh.

91
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:32,440
0 points.

92
00:07:32,440 --> 00:07:35,380
- Zero?
- I don't like mint, at all.

93
00:07:35,380 --> 00:07:37,380
1 point.

94
00:07:37,380 --> 00:07:43,420
I'm nice now, I give it 2 points. I liked the puffed rice
and the chocolate, but I hated the mint.

95
00:07:43,540 --> 00:07:46,060
Oh, okay.
I also give i 2 points.

96
00:07:46,140 --> 00:07:47,120
"Ässä"

97
00:07:47,220 --> 00:07:52,600
It's little jelly candies in different colors,
and they're shaped like letters.

98
00:07:52,980 --> 00:07:56,720
- I think you say "ässä".
- What did I say?

99
00:07:56,860 --> 00:08:00,920
- You said "ässä".
- Oh, what a big difference.

100
00:08:01,060 --> 00:08:02,820
Let's try it.

101
00:08:02,820 --> 00:08:06,520
- 1, 2, 3...
- Go.

102
00:08:08,980 --> 00:08:13,320
Good. Nice and sour.
I'll take another one.

103
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:17,700
- Oh, these are ones that make you sweaty.
- I felt that.

104
00:08:17,700 --> 00:08:19,740
Sweaty eyelids.

105
00:08:19,740 --> 00:08:22,900
Don't smack, don't smack.

106
00:08:25,760 --> 00:08:30,820
- Oh, they're really sour. Good!
- Have you tried the yellow one?

107
00:08:30,820 --> 00:08:33,220
- No.
- Yes. It was good.

108
00:08:33,220 --> 00:08:37,280
- Don't smack!
- Oh... so synthetic.

109
00:08:37,420 --> 00:08:40,420
The smack-police.

110
00:08:40,840 --> 00:08:46,600
- I give it 5 points.
- Oh! Good. I give it 3.5 points.

111
00:08:46,940 --> 00:08:51,040
- Five fives.
- Oh!

112
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:56,040
They're rolling around in my head.

113
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:58,220
I give it 4 points.

114
00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:02,300
"Karl Fazer - Maitosuklaa"

115
00:09:02,520 --> 00:09:06,220
It's milk chocolate.

116
00:09:11,980 --> 00:09:14,900
The Finnish equivalent of Marabou.

117
00:09:14,900 --> 00:09:19,040
- But a bit more boring.
- According to you.

118
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:27,780
- I think so. It tastes more like... hot chocolate.
- It kind of tastes like "grandma" to me.

119
00:09:27,900 --> 00:09:30,720
Good. Nice.

120
00:09:30,900 --> 00:09:36,380
More tasty.
I mean, more flavors inside.

121
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:40,560
It was good.
I give it 3 points.

122
00:09:41,020 --> 00:09:45,200
Everything at once.
I also give it 3 points.

123
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:48,220

124
00:09:49,060 --> 00:09:51,280

125
00:09:51,520 --> 00:09:54,520
I also give it 3 points.

126
00:09:55,000 --> 00:10:02,440
Let's take a break and answer Question of the Day
which is from Liam and Tindra, in their letter.

127
00:10:02,680 --> 00:10:09,860
They wonder if we will ever come visit
their small town, Ekenäs, if we travel to Finland.

128
00:10:10,060 --> 00:10:14,640
We would love to.
I actually think I've been to Ekenäs.

129
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:20,560
- You have?
- I think so. With my dad, like... oh God, 20 years ago.

130
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:22,620
Oh my gosh!

131
00:10:22,620 --> 00:10:24,000
We're old.

132
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:29,740
We would love to visit Finland.
All of Finland!

133
00:10:29,880 --> 00:10:33,440
This darn virus
just has to go away first.

134
00:10:33,560 --> 00:10:39,680
Yes. But, we would love to
come to Finland and visit you there.

135
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:41,680
Yes!

136
00:10:43,140 --> 00:10:45,480
"Suffeli Puffi Snacks"

137
00:10:45,820 --> 00:10:48,620
It's chocolate puffs.

138
00:10:49,540 --> 00:10:51,540

but it kind of looks like poop. ♪

142
00:11:10,040 --> 00:11:16,180
- It tastes just like corn.
- Mm, it tastes like corn, kind of.

143
00:11:16,380 --> 00:11:24,580
Well, puffed corn, with chocolate.
I liked the other "Suffeli" better.

144
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:25,780
Me too.

145
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:28,880
It tastes like badly popped...

146
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:34,560
I mean, like not well-popped popcorn
with like, a chocolate coating.

147
00:11:34,840 --> 00:11:39,620
I give this candy 1.5 point.
I didn't think it was that good.

148
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:42,060
I give it 3 points.

00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:50,720
It's diamond shaped jelly candies.

153
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:56,760
Oh, my poor little "H".

154
00:11:57,080 --> 00:12:00,440
- Did you eat an "H"?
- Yes.

155
00:12:00,520 --> 00:12:04,920
They all have letters.
They like alphabet candies in Finland.

156
00:12:04,980 --> 00:12:05,940
I think.

157
00:12:06,120 --> 00:12:11,200
I think this candy was like
a boring "Gott & Blandat" candy. 1 point.

158
00:12:11,260 --> 00:12:13,260
2 points.

159

161
00:12:16,960 --> 00:12:21,520
It's a piece of chocolate
with a white filling.

162
00:12:24,180 --> 00:12:29,200
- It's like, foamy...
- Oh, eww...

163
00:12:29,420 --> 00:12:36,960
- It's a weird mallow flavor.
- It's like a really bad mallow candy.

164
00:12:38,140 --> 00:12:42,720
- It's a little sour.
- It almost tastes like alcohol.

165
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:47,900
I popped up
at the wrong place.

166
00:12:48,300 --> 00:12:51,140
- What's happening?
- I don't know.

167
00:12:51,300 --> 00:12:55,580
Things are going south here.
What are you two doing?

168
00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:59,200
- They're spitting out the candy.
- Oh.

169
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:03,320
♪ I give it 0 points! ♪

170
00:13:03,540 --> 00:13:06,240

172
00:13:11,900 --> 00:13:15,100

- 1 point.

173
00:13:15,540 --> 00:13:16,780
"Gifu"

174
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:19,920
It's tiny black pastilles.

175
00:13:23,320 --> 00:13:27,040
- Too hard.
- It tastes like "Viol" pastilles.

176
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:32,240
- Yes, it does!
- It's really good.

177
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:42,340
- Calm down. You have to taste it before you react.
- You have to really chew on it.

178
00:13:42,620 --> 00:13:49,620
I liked "Viol"-flavor when I was little.
It has xylitol, so it's like... fresh.

179
00:13:49,620 --> 00:13:54,240
- It is a bit like "Läkerol" pastilles.
- Mm.

180
00:13:54,420 --> 00:13:59,460
- It's good for the teeth... xylitol is.
- Candy that's good for the teeth...

181
00:13:59,460 --> 00:14:04,000
- Xylitol is good for the teeth.
- Yes.

182
00:14:06,820 --> 00:14:09,720
- I give it 2 points.
- I give it 1 point.

183
00:14:09,900 --> 00:14:12,560
- 1 point.
- 3 points.

184
00:14:12,900 --> 00:14:14,740
"Tyrkisk Peber"

185
00:14:14,980 --> 00:14:20,100
It's a black hard candy
that many Swedes have tried.

186
00:14:20,440 --> 00:14:23,840
But not Alma and Harry.

187
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:28,260
- You have to chew this one.
- Chew it to pieces.

188
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:42,680
But "Tyrkisk Peber" is so good!

189
00:14:43,240 --> 00:14:47,260
Are we not good parents, or what?

190
00:14:47,260 --> 00:14:51,440
- I don't think it's that bad.
- I love "Tyrkisk Peber"! I loved it as a kid too.

191
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:53,200
Yes, it's so nice!

192
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:58,860
- My mouth is on fire, for real!
- But it's in a good way.

193
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:04,040
- Did you break it?
- Yes, it was like a grainy sauce inside.

194
00:15:04,040 --> 00:15:09,720
No, it's a powder.
And it's like... in the mouth.

195
00:15:09,840 --> 00:15:13,080
Look, it's a fire. A yummy fire.

196
00:15:13,080 --> 00:15:17,740
- Harry, did you bite yours?
- No. Luckily.

197
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:23,200
- Luckily? Yeah...
- Then you haven't even tasted it for real.

198
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:28,400
It's a pretty fun candy to have on Halloween
when someone comes knocking on your door.

199
00:15:28,580 --> 00:15:31,340
I give it 4 points.

200
00:15:31,620 --> 00:15:34,120
I give it 1 point.

201
00:15:34,300 --> 00:15:36,580
I give it 4.5 points.

202
00:15:36,740 --> 00:15:38,060
Zero!

203
00:15:38,300 --> 00:15:44,140
Thank you for watching this video!

204
00:15:44,340 --> 00:15:49,160
Please leave a thumbs up, or down.

205
00:15:49,300 --> 00:15:50,880
Most up, most up!

206
00:15:51,020 --> 00:15:54,860
Leave comments, ask questions
and take care until next time.

207
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:58,000
Bye bye!
