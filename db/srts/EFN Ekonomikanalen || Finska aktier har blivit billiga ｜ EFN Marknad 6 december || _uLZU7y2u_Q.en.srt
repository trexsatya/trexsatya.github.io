00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,280
A stock exchange that has not delivered well this year is the Helsinki Stock Exchange.

2
00:00:05,360 --> 00:00:11,040
But how you can bring it in your portfolio and build the perfect portfolio-

3
00:00:11,120 --> 00:00:14,840
-Do you get with you in today's EFN market.

4
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:23,640
Congratulations on Independence Day, Finland.

5
00:00:23,720 --> 00:00:30,840
In honor of the day, we have Kim Pessala, CEO of Evli Fondbolag. - Warm welcome.

6
00:00:30,920 --> 00:00:37,280
The year has been incredibly tough for Finnish companies and we see a pretty big discount.

7
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:45,440
Our graph shows that maybe ... something has happened. What happened?

8
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:51,960
That the year has been very tough in Finland is right. And...

9
00:00:52,040 --> 00:00:56,840
The levels are starting to become very advantageous.

10
00:00:56,920 --> 00:01:02.040
The Finnish stock exchange is interesting.

11
00:01:02,120 --> 00:01:07.720
But it differs slightly from the other Nordic stock exchanges.

12
00:01:07,800 --> 00:01:11,240
The difference is really significant.

13
00:01:11,320 --> 00:01:17,400
Personally, I connect the Swedish stock exchange and its companies a lot with the Finnish.

14
00:01:17,480 --> 00:01:20,960
Much industry, financial and insurance companies.

15
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:25,880
We export paper and so on. Industrial products.

16
00:01:25,960 --> 00:01:31,200
Why have you lost value this year?

17
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:37,240
First is good to remember that Finland is a much smaller market-

18
00:01:37,320 --> 00:01:43,080
-An the Swedish stock exchange. In declines, illikvid markets are usually punished more severely.

19
00:01:43,160 --> 00:01:46,520
We are very dependent on foreign investors-

20
00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:53,160
-which has been more cautious in Finland this year. Perhaps the war is in Ukraine in the background-

21
00:01:53,240 --> 00:01:58,240
-And affects how you think about the risk. The proximity to Russia.

22
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:05,080
We have a 1,400 kilometer limit to Russia and some investors are worried about it.

23
00:02:05,160 --> 00:02:11,080
We look at the stock exchange as such is the Finnish smaller, but very concentrated-

24
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:14,920
-If we look at the Helsinki stock market index.

25
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:19,720
There are some large companies that have gone very badly.

26
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:23,640
I mention two: Nokia and Neste.

27
00:02:23,720 --> 00:02:32,160
Both have gone very badly and it greatly affects the index level.

28
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:36,720
Compared to the Swedish Stock Exchange-

29
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:44,600
-Heas the forest industry a much larger proportion of the index in Finland today.

30
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:51,200
Then maybe it gives a little security that we have different currencies, or give the wrong picture.

31
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:57,640
I was thinking about the euro. It has made many people await the Swedish market-

32
00:02:57,720 --> 00:03:05,120
-Or because of the risk of ... you have had to work with interest rate hikes, among other things.

33
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:09,120
And uncertainty that makes international investors ...

34
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:16,280
-But the euro has not given the sustainability yet? -No, it has not attracted buyers.

35
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:21,640
As a whole, we in Evli think that the euro has been good for Finland and for the companies.

36
00:03:21,720 --> 00:03:25,680
If we look at the stable exchange rate for our companies.

37
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:31,800
And also the interest rate level. So it has made it easier for the economy in Finland.

38
00:03:31,880 --> 00:03:38,360
But otherwise the Finnish economy has been bleak. A bit like elsewhere too.

39
00:03:38,440 --> 00:03:44,720
Everything that happens with industrial production, growth, the prospects has been quite weak.

40
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:50,920
But you still see resilience during the latter part of the year. What are you saying?

41
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:59,440
If we look at individual companies, they are starting to be very cheaply priced.

42
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:04.800
Finland has had two years of downward stock prices.

43
00:04:04,880 --> 00:04:11,680
At the same time, the companies' situation is not completely hopeless.

44
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:19,400
Next year, we expect a profit growth of 5-7 % if we look at index level.

45
00:04:19,480 --> 00:04:22,920
And at the same time, these companies are very cheap.

46
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:30,120
So if you look a little longer you should own the Finnish stock exchange as well.

47
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:33,880
Could it be a good position to come in if you don't have ...?

48
00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:37,880
Not getting in at the top is always nice.

49
00:04:37,960 --> 00:04:43,440
Exactly, that's it. And as we all see when we look forward at 2024-

50
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:49,600
-As we are a little more positive, because we see that interest rates should not rise anymore.

51
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:55,320
Fed has done its thing, the ECB has probably done its thing.

52
00:04:55,400 --> 00:05:01.440
At the same time we see that the growth figures are getting a little lower-

53
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:06,240
-in the start of next year. If it becomes a "soft landing" in the US, we will see ...

54
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:10,160
But clearly lower growth.

55
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:15,280
And it is already priced that the policy rates will be lower in 2024.

56
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:19,160
It should stimulate the economy to some extent.

57
00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:26,920
You started working in the financial market before 1992.

58
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:33,160
You are a bit back in a world with a lot of uncertainty-

59
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:36.560
-But where interest rates are also interesting again.

60
00:05:36,640 --> 00:05:38,800
-Just. -Do you other synergies?

61
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:44,360
That's right. In 1992 I started as an interest portfolio manager in a Finnish company-

62
00:05:44,440 --> 00:05:49,600
-What was called Invest at that time. 1995 I moved to Evli where I was five years-

63
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:52.920
-When "market maker" in Finnish government bonds.

64
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:59.560
At that time we had much higher interest rates. The interest rate level was 6-10 %-

65
00:05:59,640 --> 00:06:06,040
-Depend on which year we are talking about. Then you got used to significantly higher interest rates.

66
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:09.640
What has now happened is that it has been normalized.

67
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:12,640
We have returned to a normal environment.

68
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:16,760
This whole zero -interest environment was not normal.

69
00:06:16,840 --> 00:06:23,920
We probably do not return to a zero-interest environment, at least not in five to ten years.

70
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:27,320
And it has an impact on many things.

71
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:35.560
Is it interesting to look wider ...? You should always have a diversified portfolio.

72
00:06:35,640 --> 00:06:41,920
But do you see a trend, against interest, but also among portfolios?

73
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,560
If we look at our Finnish customers-

74
00:06:44,640 --> 00:06:50,880
-Boe the institutional and our private banking customers.

75
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:55.560
As you said, they have started allocating much more to interest rates.

76
00:06:55,640 --> 00:06:59.440
That logic is very simple.

77
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:05,160
A good interest portfolio returns 5-6 %.

78
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:12,280
Are you prepared to take a little more "high yield loan", loans with lower rating-

79
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:15,840
-Can you get a return of 8-9 %.

80
00:07:15,920 --> 00:07:19,480
More than the stock exchange on average has returned in many years.

81
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:23,840
Yes, and therefore allocates investors to these assets.

82
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:26,160
Where do they take the assets?

83
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:30,280
Very many reduce the share weight in Finland.

84
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:33,480
What do you do then on the alternative side?

85
00:07:33,560 --> 00:07:39,240
Our investors in Finland are very careful when it comes to housing-

86
00:07:39,320 --> 00:07:45,440
-and real estate. That market is calm-

87
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:50,800
-The sellers want better prices than the buyers are prepared to pay.

88
00:07:50,880 --> 00:07:56,880
We see investors who are prepared to start buying properties again.

89
00:07:56,960 --> 00:08:03,240
But they still want to see slightly higher Yield levels, lower prices on real estate.

90
00:08:03,320 --> 00:08:08.640
But the real estate market is very close to the bottom, thanks to be-

91
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:14,600
-That interest rates no longer rise. It is certainly the most important component for it.

92
00:08:14,680 --> 00:08:22,040
As for the other alternatives, we have always been quite cautious in Evli-

93
00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:26,360
-With unlisted, smaller growth companies.

94
00:08:26,440 --> 00:08:33,400
We focus more on bigger “buyout”-

95
00:08:33,480 --> 00:08:38,080
-As private, global companies, well diversified.

96
00:08:38,160 --> 00:08:42,880
So there is a potential for companies that have matured a little more?

97
00:08:42,960 --> 00:08:47,080
Do you invest more there? Or invest more there?

98
00:08:47,160 --> 00:08:50,680
There we are still investing.

99
00:08:50,760 --> 00:08:56,600
We bought a company in 2019 that had done so since the beginning of the 2000s.

100
00:08:56,680 --> 00:09:04,240
And it has returned significantly more for 20 years than the listed stock exchange.

101
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:08,360
Significantly more. And we don't see that engine being broken in any way.

102
00:09:08,440 --> 00:09:13,840
Which listed companies would you say are interesting-

103
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:20,720
-And can stand well on the Finnish stock exchange now that there is still a little more harsh climate?

104
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:26,320
Although the interest rate drops, and it usually benefits growth company-

105
00:09:27,520 --> 00:09:33,040
-So we like companies that make money at the moment. "Cash Flow is King."

106
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:36,640
And it may be companies that pay high dividends.

107
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:42,320
We think that can be a good strategy. Or companies that have steady cash flows.

108
00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:46,600
Quite traditional companies. We see them very cheaply priced at the moment.

109
00:09:46,680 --> 00:09:50,760
We think it is a good long -term placement.

110
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:55,440
Many times these companies correlate quite well with inflation as well-

111
00:09:55,520 --> 00:09:58.560
-If it would start rising again.

112
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:03,680
Any specific sectors that you find interesting to mention?

113
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:07.640
Most sectors are very cheap.

114
00:10:07,720 --> 00:10:11,200
Small companies are very cheaply priced.

115
00:10:11,280 --> 00:10:16,120
In the long run we have ... The biggest finds we have found in small companies.

116
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:23,200
So we tend to allocate a lot to small and medium -sized companies.

117
00:10:23,280 --> 00:10:28,640
More defensive shares, which you usually say may stay better ...

118
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:33,720
For example, you mentioned Nokia as an actor.

119
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:38,440
Why do they lose ground and will they continue, do you think?

120
00:10:38,520 --> 00:10:44,360
With Nokia, there are probably some company-specific challenges and problems-

121
00:10:44,440 --> 00:10:48,040
-which has hit them, and ...

122
00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:52,760
If we want to go to telecom or IT sector-

123
00:10:52,840 --> 00:10:55,960
-The so we usually want to look at the United States.

124
00:10:56,040 --> 00:10:59,240
They are so much stronger and more dynamic.

125
00:10:59,320 --> 00:11:05,640
When things are going well for "growth", the growth sectors, then things are going well in the United States.

126
00:11:05,720 --> 00:11:09.800
Then we usually take that exposure from the United States.

127
00:11:09,880 --> 00:11:14,520
We miss a little that exposure in Finland. It is also a cause to-

128
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:18,840
-Why the stock exchange has been so much weaker, especially compared to the US stock exchange

129
00:11:18,920 --> 00:11:22,240
-As has returned almost 20 % this year.

130
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:25,280
But that is an opportunity for someone.

131
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:30,520
For example, we see some acquisitions and acquisition candidates.

132
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:34,080
Is this something that you think will continue?

133
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:39,520
Surely some. This year there has been very little of it. A problem is enough-

134
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:44,320
-That IPOs are at a low level. There will be no new listed companies.

135
00:11:44,400 --> 00:11:50,640
It is also a problem for these "Buy Out" companies, the "Buy Out" funds.

136
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:53,680
-How should they be able to make an exit? -Good question.

137
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:57,080
Then we see such "Continuation" funds that you do instead.

138
00:11:57,160 --> 00:12:03,360
One has a fund that has been placed for ten years and should come to the end of his maturity-

139
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:08,720
-And then make a new fund that becomes one of this "Continuation"-Fond-

140
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:13,920
-As a first fund's holding instead of making an IPO.

141
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,880
This is perhaps something on the alternative side-

142
00:12:16,960 --> 00:12:21,120
-As our Finnish investors are currently thinking about ...

143
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:26,880
Do they dare "commit" so much assets to these alternatives in the coming years?

144
00:12:26,960 --> 00:12:29,960
Because it has come very little money back-

145
00:12:30,040 --> 00:12:33,120
-It has not been done much exit.

146
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:37.560
And when not much exit is done, or much IPOs who then do exit-

147
00:12:37,640 --> 00:12:40,200
-Then the investors become more careful.

148
00:12:40,280 --> 00:12:45,480
And they may not have received their money back so that they can go into something new.

149
00:12:45,560 --> 00:12:48,880
Not to mention minor growth company-

150
00:12:48,960 --> 00:12:53,840
-There they've actually burned up their money.

151
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:58,840
For several of them, EBIT is negative. Now it is out of money.

152
00:12:58,920 --> 00:13:04,160
They need new money and make a new funding round, a fourth or fifth.

153
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:09,640
And the environment is pretty much colder at the moment. So what we see is-

154
00:13:09,720 --> 00:13:16,680
-That the values go down sharply in the companies when they seek new funding.

155
00:13:16,760 --> 00:13:23,080
There is a lack of venture capital to these growth companies.

156
00:13:23,160 --> 00:13:26,520
They are cautious, venture capital players.

157
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:31,000
But is it just as cold on the private side? I think for example ...

158
00:13:31,080 --> 00:13:35,240
In Sweden, we have so much invested in our properties and housing-

159
00:13:35,320 --> 00:13:42,240
-So we are very sensitive to a decline in values. What does it look like in Finland there?

160
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:45,400
-Is you just as scared? -You are worried in Finland.

161
00:13:45,480 --> 00:13:50,400
But it is probably mainly because the labor market looks much weaker.

162
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:54,160
So the consumer entrance indicators are at a very low level.

163
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:57,000
And you are a little more worried about your own finances.

164
00:13:57,080 --> 00:14:03,640
Rising interest rates, falling property prices, high energy costs, high inflation ...

165
00:14:03,720 --> 00:14:07,120
All this eats on the consumer's confidence.

166
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:10,280
We see this signs of in Finland.

167
00:14:10,360 --> 00:14:14,520
And the Finnish small savers have had two tough years.

168
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:19,680
Whatever they have bought on the Finnish stock exchange, it is almost at minus this year.

169
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:25,360
Do you think they expect the light in the tunnel now 2024-

170
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:28,320
-or are you preparing for the worst?

171
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:34,640
I think the investors will see that next year will be better.

172
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:40,160
What we know is that interest rates are not rising anymore. It is a very important factor.

173
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:43,400
And for normal investors ...

174
00:14:43,480 --> 00:14:49,040
The fact that the interest rate comes down facilitates their costs for home loans.

175
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:52,800
In Finland, almost all home loans are bound to Euribor.

176
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:57,720
So if Euribor goes down, they immediately receive a smaller interest cost.

177
00:14:57,800 --> 00:15:03,320
So you will see, especially when we look at the investment market on the Finnish stock exchange-

178
00:15:03,400 --> 00:15:06,960
-So it will brighten.

179
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:11,480
Then if you look at the business-

180
00:15:11,560 --> 00:15:18,040
-and on some investment funds and products-

181
00:15:18,120 --> 00:15:24,840
-So we may see that there is a lot of debt that must be financed again.

182
00:15:24,920 --> 00:15:30,440
And though the policy rate drops so ...

183
00:15:30,520 --> 00:15:34,480
There are so much loans that need to be financed again-

184
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:42,280
-So it may be that the risk premium, the price they have to pay for new loan-

185
00:15:42,360 --> 00:15:44,560
-will rise.

186
00:15:44,640 --> 00:15:48,280
But can't it be that you now get in at the top?

187
00:15:48,360 --> 00:15:54,400
That those who allocate about their portfolios, that they invest errors at the top in the interest rate market-

188
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:58,240
-and that they get a lower return. Isn't that risk?

189
00:15:58,320 --> 00:16:02.560
As an investor, if you have a little longer horizon and place in corporate loans ...

190
00:16:02,640 --> 00:16:05,760
Then this is a great buying position.

191
00:16:05,840 --> 00:16:09,520
But for companies ... we had an example here in Finland.

192
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:14,960
A medium-sized company in the construction industry that in 2021 had borrowed money-

193
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:20,080
-with an interest rate level of 4.75 %...

194
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:24,840
A month ago they borrowed money again at an interest rate of 11.4.

195
00:16:24,920 --> 00:16:30,600
It is a pretty big extra cost that eats up the profit.

196
00:16:30,680 --> 00:16:36,920
But for the investors it is good, as long as the company just doesn't go bankrupt.

197
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,320
-The cash flows become important. -Yes.

198
00:16:39,400 --> 00:16:43,240
And in interest investment - diversify. It is the most important thing.

199
00:16:43,320 --> 00:16:47,160
We take that with us. And one last question ...

200
00:16:47,240 --> 00:16:52,120
What does the perfect portfolio look like for 2024?

201
00:16:52,200 --> 00:16:56,800
The perfect portfolio for 2024, there is a lot of interest rates.

202
00:16:56,880 --> 00:17:04,200
We currently take the assets we invest in interest rates from the liquid equity portfolio.

203
00:17:04,280 --> 00:17:08,240
We are less positive about growth companies.

204
00:17:08,320 --> 00:17:14,800
That said, "Cash Flow is King". We enjoy stock risk that generate cash flow-

205
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:18,120
-Companies that pay high dividends.

206
00:17:18,200 --> 00:17:24,880
On the alternative side, we are still waiting on the property side.

207
00:17:24,960 --> 00:17:28,160
But we do not reduce that allocation.

208
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:32,200
And we continue to place in “Private Equity”-

209
00:17:32,280 --> 00:17:37,200
-When we see as a long game. You place in alternative products-

210
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:42,080
-So you have to have a horizon that is ten years plus.

211
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:44,640
Thank you so much for being with you.

212
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:47,640
We're back in a couple of days.

213
00:17:47,720 --> 00:17:53,560
This is actually my last program as program manager for EFN Market.

214
00:17:53,640 --> 00:17:59,320
So I have to thank you for being with you. Thanks for some amazing years together.

215
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:01,840
See you soon.
