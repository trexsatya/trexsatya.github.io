1
00:00:05,376 --> 00:00:08.192
To our constant need for

2
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:13,312
staggering, winding and witty stories intensified

3
00:00:13,568 --> 00:00:15,104
in the shadow of the farms

4
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:18,176
is equally indisputably true here and now

5
00:00:18,432 --> 00:00:21,504
a half month into the second year of Pandemin

6
00:00:22,016 --> 00:00:24,320
As it was almost 700 years ago

7
00:00:24,832 --> 00:00:27,392
When Giovanni Boccaccio in his Decamerone

8
00:00:27,904 --> 00:00:30,976
let ten young florentinians escape the bulge

9
00:00:30,976 --> 00:00:32,976
to a country villa there

10
00:00:33,024 --> 00:00:35,584
They told ten stories each,

11
00:00:36,352 --> 00:00:38,144
one nicer than the other

12
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:43,520
About lurid priests and women who dated in their men the most amazing lies

13
00:00:43,776 --> 00:00:45.568
to get a shepherd's time with their lovers.

14
00:00:47,616 --> 00:00:49,152
During these miserable months

15
00:00:49,408 --> 00:00:50,432
Soon 15

16
00:00:50,688 --> 00:00:54,528
Have we devoured both large and widely landscaped novels

17
00:00:54,784 --> 00:00:58.368
As Lydia Sandgren "Collected works" and Klas Östergren's "Renegates"

18
00:00:58,624 --> 00:01:02.720
And countless television series, which most recently the wonderful "fast cash".

19
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07.072
It is with joy and gratitude, a privilege,

20
00:01:07,584 --> 00:01:10,656
that this sunny and chilled spring evening

21
00:01:10,912 --> 00:01:16,288
Get health all you out in the digital Gutenberg galaxy, welcome to the Gothenburg City Library

22
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:22,432
And a conversation with one of the truly great storytelling artists, the Finnish -Swedish author Kjell Westö,

23
00:01:22,944 --> 00:01:26,272
whose latest novel "Tritonus" coming out last fall,

24
00:01:26,528 --> 00:01:28,320
be played out in a close

25
00:01:28,576 --> 00:01:29,344
Postpandemic

26
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:30,112
future.

27
00:01:31,648 --> 00:01:32,672
Welcome Kjell!

28
00:01:33,184 --> 00:01:34,208
Thank you, Ragnar!

29
00:01:34,208 --> 00:01:36,208
It was a nice presentation.

30
00:01:37,024 --> 00:01:42,400
I will also greet you from a mutual friend, namely Teo Kallifatides,

31
00:01:42,912 --> 00:01:45,984
that sounds good for

32
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:47,520
When you call him

33
00:01:48,032 --> 00:01:50,080
the most elegant by writers

34
00:01:50,336 --> 00:01:52,128
So he completely agrees with you.

35
00:01:56,224 --> 00:02:01,600
Kjell Westö debuted in 1986 with the poetry collection "Tango Orange"

36
00:02:01,856 --> 00:02:03.648
and got its big breakthrough

37
00:02:03,904 --> 00:02:05.440
ten years later with the novel

38
00:02:05,952 --> 00:02:07.488
"The dragons over Helsinki"

39
00:02:07,744 --> 00:02:13,632
who began a series of independent novels about human fate with the Helsinki of the 20th century

40
00:02:13,888 --> 00:02:14,912
as suggestive

41
00:02:15,168 --> 00:02:15,936
and detailed fund.

42
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:23,104
In 2013, Westö received the Nordic Council Literature Prize, to name one of many

43
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:25,920
prestigious awards and awards Westö has been awarded.

44
00:02:26,688 --> 00:02:28,736
He is also a guitarist in

45
00:02:28,992 --> 00:02:30.016
The cover band what

46
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:34,624
And once upon a time, key players in the Finnish writer's team.

47
00:02:35,648 --> 00:02:37,440
Like Jaques Werup and

48
00:02:37,696 --> 00:02:43,840
Theodor Kallifatides is Kjell Westö a nice example of the fact that musicality and ball mind are

49
00:02:44,096 --> 00:02:44.608
Large assets for a writer.

50
00:02:47,936 --> 00:02:48,960
What does

51
00:02:49,216 --> 00:02:50,240
Kjell Westös

52
00:02:50,496 --> 00:02:54.848
round paintings at one time so accessible and challenged,

53
00:02:55,616 --> 00:02:56,896
is partly, of course,

54
00:02:56,896 --> 00:03:01.248
Prosan's artistically immense distribution of shadows and days,

55
00:03:01,248 --> 00:03:08.928
which is Shakespeare's definition of poetry, donates "Airy nothing. A local habitation and a name."

56
00:03:08,928 --> 00:03:14,816
Partly that they are permeated by the conviction of the power and ability of the story

57
00:03:15,072 --> 00:03:16,864
to explore human life

58
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:17,888
and its riddles,

59
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:23,776
Where the present is cohabiting with history like Siamese twins, back to back,

60
00:03:24,191 --> 00:03:29,666
so that at the same time we see the past sucked in and down into the drainage of time

61
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:30,944
And the future rush us to meet.

62
00:03:32,992 --> 00:03:36,320
At Kjell Westö, every human being is a miracle.

63
00:03:37,088 --> 00:03:41,440
As the last sentence in “Don't go alone in the night” the fourth

64
00:03:41,696 --> 00:03:44,512
the novel in the Helsinki Site, reads in

65
00:03:44,768 --> 00:03:46.048
All melancholy trust.

66
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:56,544
Speaking of "Don't go alone in the night" you said with empfas in an interview,

67
00:03:56,800 --> 00:04:00,128
When it came out ten years ago 2011 that you were

68
00:04:00,384 --> 00:04:01.408
And now I quote you,

69
00:04:01,664 --> 00:04:03,200
"Finished with Helsinki".

70
00:04:04,992 --> 00:04:06,272
Once for all.

71
00:04:06,784 --> 00:04:08.832
And was even attracted to the idea of becoming

72
00:04:09,088 --> 00:04:11,954
"Minimalist at fifty".

73
00:04:12,416 --> 00:04:12,928
Now

74
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:14,208
Do I want to ask you:

75
00:04:15,488 --> 00:04:17,791
Ten years and three novels, of which only

76
00:04:18,303 --> 00:04:21,119
"Tritonus" does not have Helsinki as a stage room

77
00:04:21,887 --> 00:04:22,399
later,

78
00:04:22,655 --> 00:04:24,447
Plus a novel project

79
00:04:24,703 --> 00:04:30,847
in progress with Helsinki during the intermediate peace until the continuation war as a fund and

80
00:04:30,847 --> 00:04:36,223
“The sulfur yellow sky” about to become a movie

81
00:04:36,223 --> 00:04:41.087
it seems to me as your narrative voice has made you abandon

82
00:04:41,343 --> 00:04:43,391
the minimalist ambitions,

83
00:04:43,659 --> 00:04:47,219
And getting rid of Helsinki? Is it true?

84
00:04:47,743 --> 00:04:49,279
Two things I will immediately think about.

85
00:04:49,535 --> 00:04:50,559
One is

86
00:04:51,071 --> 00:04:57,215
the unfortunate thing in always being interviewed, or very often being interviewed, when you have just completed a book

87
00:04:57,471 --> 00:05:01.567
And it has gone into print. Because then at least I am so pumped so that

88
00:05:01,823 --> 00:05:03,359
I say the most,

89
00:05:03,615 --> 00:05:04,383
what to call it,

90
00:05:04,895 --> 00:05:11,039
I seek empathy in my fatigue and say things of that kind.

91
00:05:11,295 --> 00:05:11,807
When I regain the forces

92
00:05:12,319 --> 00:05:16,415
So it will be as you just explained, differently.

93
00:05:16,927 --> 00:05:18,207
Yet

94
00:05:18,463 --> 00:05:20,767
a word of truth in this.

95
00:05:21,023 --> 00:05:27,167
Now there have been three novels after that, two of them Helsinki novels, "Hägring 38" and "the sulfur yellow sky"

96
00:05:27,423 --> 00:05:28,447
and i'm doing a novel again

97
00:05:28,703 --> 00:05:34,847
But I just postponed this minimalist dream. Now it is minimalist at 65.

98
00:05:35,103 --> 00:05:41,418
I'll be there but I've been postponing it for 15 years.

99
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:42,271
Yes

100
00:05:42,527 --> 00:05:46,367
I love short stories and the fact is that, I'll insert a parenthesis here.

101
00:05:47,647 --> 00:05:51,487
Alongside my novel project that maybe we will come back to later, so I'm going on right now

102
00:05:51,743 --> 00:05:56.607
and writes, along with a writer colleague whose name I do not intend to state,

103
00:05:57,119 --> 00:06:00.703
A short prose book with the working name! The years "where we write short texts

104
00:06:00,959 --> 00:06:03.007
which deals with the passage of time

105
00:06:03,263 --> 00:06:04.031
With offspring

106
00:06:04,543 --> 00:06:05.311
in different years.

107
00:06:05,823 --> 00:06:06,591
And I enjoy

108
00:06:06,847 --> 00:06:08.895
great by writing these

109
00:06:09,151 --> 00:06:10,687
one to four sides

110
00:06:10,943 --> 00:06:14,015
short prose texts that I actually seriously,

111
00:06:14,271 --> 00:06:16,575
This dream of becoming a minimalist has rather

112
00:06:16,831 --> 00:06:20,927
grown and strengthened but as long as the novel ideas

113
00:06:21,439 --> 00:06:22,719
forces me ...

114
00:06:22,975 --> 00:06:24,767
And they seem to

115
00:06:25,023 --> 00:06:26,559
do.

116
00:06:27,071 --> 00:06:27,583
Yes.

117
00:06:29,119 --> 00:06:33,727
As you said when we were talking to before the broadcast got started so

118
00:06:34,495 --> 00:06:40,639
crossed our roads last in the mind world in the queue to ETC's alternative book fair tent on Heden,

119
00:06:40,895 --> 00:06:43,199
that sungous Saturday

120
00:06:43,455 --> 00:06:46,015
In September the strange year

121
00:06:46,271 --> 00:06:46,783
2017

122
00:06:47,295 --> 00:06:50,111
With the Nordic Resistance Movement's demonstration in the flags.

123
00:06:51,391 --> 00:06:54,207
Then we talked for a while about the author boycott

124
00:06:54,719 --> 00:06:58.047
toward the book fair because of the decision to invite

125
00:06:58.303 --> 00:07:01,119
The right -wing extremist magazine New Times.

126
00:07:01,631 --> 00:07:05.471
A decision that incidentally became the origin of a tough

127
00:07:05,727 --> 00:07:09.055
And infected debate on freedom of speech and intellectual responsibility.

128
00:07:11,103 --> 00:07:16,223
How do you view that problem and that position today?

129
00:07:16,735 --> 00:07:21,855
In this with your wording a letter to your writer colleague Juha Itkonen

130
00:07:23,903 --> 00:07:24,415
quote:

131
00:07:24,671 --> 00:07:27,487
Where humanity seems fully partly part

132
00:07:27,743 --> 00:07:32,095
As for the longing for, on the one hand, a freedom and solidarity society,

133
00:07:32,351 --> 00:07:34,911
On the other hand, a tyrannical and authoritarian.

134
00:07:35,423 --> 00:07:36,191
How would you

135
00:07:37,215 --> 00:07:38,495
Relate to this today?

136
00:07:40,031 --> 00:07:42,591
Then autumn 2017,

137
00:07:43,103 --> 00:07:49,247
The debate had started long before, it had started in the spring of 2017 or maybe even in the winter of 2017

138
00:07:51,295 --> 00:07:53,855
I grasped after great anguish and very pondering

139
00:07:54,367 --> 00:07:55,135
The choice to

140
00:07:55,903 --> 00:07:57.695
Go to Gothenburg

141
00:07:57,951 --> 00:07:59.743
Book Fair 2017 and

142
00:07:59,999 --> 00:08:03.071
Make resistance to Nazism and fascism in that way.

143
00:08:03,327 --> 00:08:06,143
Then it became a pretty hot debate

144
00:08:07,167 --> 00:08:08,959
There were young colleagues who even

145
00:08:09,215 --> 00:08:11,775
accused us who went for being some kind

146
00:08:13,311 --> 00:08:19,455
runners to dark forces, right -wing extremist forces. It swed, can i say, for i'm

147
00:08:19,711 --> 00:08:22,783
So sworn antinazi and anti -fascist as you can become.

148
00:08:23,039 --> 00:08:25,087
It was then

149
00:08:25,343 --> 00:08:25,855
if

150
00:08:26,367 --> 00:08:30,463
What one thought was the right way to resist

151
00:08:30,975 --> 00:08:32,511
Against the dark forces.

152
00:08:32,767 --> 00:08:37,119
I made the decision after great anguish that decision, and therefore it was so important

153
00:08:37,375 --> 00:08:38.911
When I had free moments at the fair

154
00:08:39,423 --> 00:08:40,703
Vacant moments so

155
00:08:40,959 --> 00:08:42,239
I went out on the heath,

156
00:08:42,495 --> 00:08:47,615
For the alternative fair and for demonstrations because that was where I belonged.

157
00:08:48,127 --> 00:08:48,639
Yes

158
00:08:51,455 --> 00:08:52,223
In summary

159
00:08:52,479 --> 00:08:53,759
Many years later

160
00:08:54,015 --> 00:08:57,343
I think nothing is won. Nothing gets won by

161
00:08:57,855 --> 00:09:00,159
that people who are basically on the same page

162
00:09:00,415 --> 00:09:01.951
holding on and blaming each other

163
00:09:03,231 --> 00:09:04.767
for betrayal and for

164
00:09:05,791 --> 00:09:11,167
wrong decisions. This is very important, we know from history, so many times

165
00:09:11,423 --> 00:09:12.703
in history has

166
00:09:13,471 --> 00:09:17.567
These good forces that are just a little disagreed for each other.

167
00:09:17,823 --> 00:09:22,468
You are almost blinded for where the darkness really comes from.

168
00:09:22,943 --> 00:09:29,087
Don't let the Nazi tree obscure the Social Democratic Forest, like the German

169
00:09:29,343 --> 00:09:30,879
Communist leader Ernst Thälmann once said.

170
00:09:31,647 --> 00:09:34,463
Which we know what led to.

171
00:09:34,719 --> 00:09:35,487
We know that.

172
00:09:35,743 --> 00:09:36,511
Germany, late 20s,

173
00:09:36,767 --> 00:09:40,095
Early 30s are a good example of just that.

174
00:09:40,351 --> 00:09:45,215
Then the Social Democrats and Communists devoted all the forces to fight each other. Then it went as it went.

175
00:09:45,215 --> 00:09:49.567
It is this that also constitutes

176
00:09:49,823 --> 00:09:52,383
the offshoot for,

177
00:09:52,639 --> 00:09:54,687
I don't know if you read, Åsa Linderborgs

178
00:09:55,199 --> 00:09:55.711
diary

179
00:09:55,967 --> 00:09:57.503
"The year by 13 months".

180
00:09:57,759 --> 00:09:59,039
It starts exactly there.

181
00:10:00,575 --> 00:10:04.671
And there metoo comes in too.

182
00:10:05,183 --> 00:10:06,975
The year that followed on

183
00:10:08,767 --> 00:10:10.303
Book Fair

184
00:10:12,607 --> 00:10:13,119
where

185
00:10:14,131 --> 00:10:16,447
the introduction to a polarization

186
00:10:16,703 --> 00:10:20,543
whose aftermath and effects, whose aftershocks

187
00:10:21,055 --> 00:10:22,847
We still feel today.

188
00:10:27,455 --> 00:10:30,783
Polarization might have started a little sneakily in the past

189
00:10:30,979 --> 00:10:34,198
But then the positions were locked.

190
00:10:34,623 --> 00:10:36,159
One must say that under

191
00:10:36,415 --> 00:10:38,719
the four, five last years have

192
00:10:40,255 --> 00:10:43,839
It exploded, so much has happened. It has been tumultuous years.

193
00:10:44,095 --> 00:10:45,631
A result of

194
00:10:46,655 --> 00:10:49,727
The tumultuous world we live in today.

195
00:10:51,519 --> 00:10:57,407
Right -wing extremism has emerged in Europe in a way that I at least, if you had told me when I was young at

196
00:10:57,663 --> 00:11:01,759
The 1980s and 90s like this will go, so I had not believed.

197
00:11:03,039 --> 00:11:04,575
No,

198
00:11:04,831 --> 00:11:06.623
already

199
00:11:06,879 --> 00:11:08.415
When New Democracy

200
00:11:09,183 --> 00:11:10,975
come into parliament

201
00:11:11,487 --> 00:11:16,351
Did you tell yourself that, my God if I had said it 10 years ago, had

202
00:11:16,863 --> 00:11:20,703
I was advised to seek help.

203
00:11:23,775 --> 00:11:28,383
Now it really

204
00:11:28,639 --> 00:11:29,919
Ultralight

205
00:11:30,431 --> 00:11:31,711
position.

206
00:11:32,223 --> 00:11:37,087
It is much, much stronger forces and much more thoughtful forces in motion now.

207
00:11:37,855 --> 00:11:38,367
So it has gone.

208
00:11:38,879 --> 00:11:45,023
For us 20th-century people who both you and I are, it is a few years, but we originate

209
00:11:45,279 --> 00:11:49,887
from the same time, I think that too many of us

210
00:11:50,143 --> 00:11:54,751
so the new millennium's first two decades have been

211
00:11:55,007 --> 00:12:00,383
Let's call it an absurdity's progress that has become more and more bizarre and difficult to understand.

212
00:12:02,687 --> 00:12:07.039
Our thoughts, our performance worlds

213
00:12:11,135 --> 00:12:14,975
stands in relief against World War II.

214
00:12:15,231 --> 00:12:18,815
It was the big story that preceded us.

215
00:12:19,327 --> 00:12:25,471
I was born 5 years after the war and my grandfather was a Jew so I always heard if Hitler won the war you had

216
00:12:25,727 --> 00:12:26,239
not been born.

217
00:12:26,751 --> 00:12:32,895
Which was quite heavy when you were five.

218
00:12:35,711 --> 00:12:39,039
To study the story has for me been a

219
00:12:39,551 --> 00:12:40,319
It's a given

220
00:12:40,831 --> 00:12:41,855
and

221
00:12:42,111 --> 00:12:43,135
a necessity.

222
00:12:44,415 --> 00:12:46,207
For me, it wasn't a matter of course first.

223
00:12:46,463 --> 00:12:49,279
I was born a little later, 1961,

224
00:12:49,791 --> 00:12:54,911
And as a really young, I tried to dive into Anglo -Saxon popular culture and as well as pretending to

225
00:12:55,423 --> 00:12:57,983
I was born long after the Second World War and that it

226
00:12:58,239 --> 00:13:00.031
Don't really affect me that much.

227
00:13:00,543 --> 00:13:06.431
This was so terribly thought error, partly purely chronologically because I was born

228
00:13:06,687 --> 00:13:10,783
Sixteen years after the Second World War ended. What is sixteen years old, it's nothing.

229
00:13:11,039 --> 00:13:15,135
So I also came from a family where both grandfather and grandfather had fallen into the wars.

230
00:13:16,415 --> 00:13:22.559
To think the way I tried to do when I was 15, 20 years old, I discovered then when

231
00:13:23,071 --> 00:13:26,143
I became an adult for real, so I discovered that it was not sustainable.

232
00:13:26,399 --> 00:13:27,679
Because that's exactly as you say.

233
00:13:28,191 --> 00:13:33,434
It is the great tragic story that exists as a fund for our generation

234
00:13:33,823 --> 00:13:34,591
Own experiences.

235
00:13:35,359 --> 00:13:41,503
Also a traditional historical experience

236
00:13:42,271 --> 00:13:43,551
that makes us as,

237
00:13:43,807 --> 00:13:46,111
I will come in at a little later in

238
00:13:46,367 --> 00:13:48,927
connection with “Hägring 38”

239
00:13:49,439 --> 00:13:51,231
that we know what

240
00:13:52,511 --> 00:13:53,535
these

241
00:13:54,047 --> 00:13:56.607
the phrases about cultural -imposing elements,

242
00:13:57,119 --> 00:13:59,167
Where they will end up in the end.

243
00:13:59,679 --> 00:14:01,471
Where they

244
00:14:01,727 --> 00:14:04.031
The ideas for the world.

245
00:14:05,311 --> 00:14:11,199
I imagine there was another complication for you

246
00:14:12,223 --> 00:14:13,247
with two fallen.

247
00:14:13,759 --> 00:14:16,575
A fallen grandfather and a fallen grandfather.

248
00:14:17,087 --> 00:14:21,695
Because Finland de facto was

249
00:14:23,999 --> 00:14:25,279
Germany's allies,

250
00:14:27,071 --> 00:14:29,375
that it was not

251
00:14:29,631 --> 00:14:30,399
Equally obvious

252
00:14:30,655 --> 00:14:32,703
positions and that they

253
00:14:33,215 --> 00:14:36,543
conditioned a prize in social and private life.

254
00:14:37,055 --> 00:14:37,823
Was it so?

255
00:14:38,847 --> 00:14:39,871
That

256
00:14:40,127 --> 00:14:41,151
Very complicated.

257
00:14:42,687 --> 00:14:44,223
That what a thing we Finland

258
00:14:44,735 --> 00:14:48,575
Had very difficult to meet. We all had sorts, when I was a child for example

259
00:14:48,831 --> 00:14:51,135
and went to school and grew up there were all possible

260
00:14:51,903 --> 00:14:52,671
theories

261
00:14:53,183 --> 00:14:54,719
built around this that would

262
00:14:55,999 --> 00:14:58.815
as well as liberate us from the realization that we had been Germany's

263
00:14:59,071 --> 00:14:59,839
Allies.

264
00:15:00,351 --> 00:15:04.447
That we waged a separate war against the Soviet Union between 1941-1944

265
00:15:04,447 --> 00:15:07.519
There was a theory called Driver theory,

266
00:15:07,775 --> 00:15:10,591
which is about small nations

267
00:15:11,103 --> 00:15:12,639
are so powerless

268
00:15:12,895 --> 00:15:14,431
In the great swirls of history

269
00:15:14,943 --> 00:15:15,711
compared with

270
00:15:15,967 --> 00:15:19,807
the great powers. That we are like driftwood in the swirls of these history.

271
00:15:21,087 --> 00:15:22,367
I grew up with that.

272
00:15:23,903 --> 00:15:24,671
It was written

273
00:15:25,439 --> 00:15:26,207
And was said so

274
00:15:26,463 --> 00:15:27,743
but

275
00:15:28,511 --> 00:15:31,071
the bitter and grim truth is, after all

276
00:15:31,327 --> 00:15:32,095
that we ...

277
00:15:34,143 --> 00:15:35,423
It was not a separate war

278
00:15:35,679 --> 00:15:36,447
Without us

279
00:15:36,703 --> 00:15:37,727
fought after all.

280
00:15:40,287 --> 00:15:43,871
But it was also a time when it is very difficult to find,

281
00:15:44,127 --> 00:15:45,919
In Sweden you have spoken

282
00:15:46,943 --> 00:15:51,295
Much about the debt that existed in allowing transit, etc.

283
00:15:54,367 --> 00:15:56,671
It is a theme that has been difficult.

284
00:15:56,927 --> 00:15:58,207
I have not written myself

285
00:15:58,719 --> 00:16:01.023
so much. I actually avoid writing

286
00:16:01,279 --> 00:16:03,839
novels about the war itself just because my

287
00:16:04,095 --> 00:16:07.167
Grandfather had fallen and there has been a trauma in my family.

288
00:16:07,423 --> 00:16:12.031
There has been a lot of Finnish fiction in recent years

289
00:16:12,287 --> 00:16:13,567
who are now trying to treat all of these

290
00:16:15,359 --> 00:16:19,711
German Wermacht that was up in Lapland, how we treated

291
00:16:19,967 --> 00:16:24,540
Soviet prisoners of war and that kind of ...

292
00:16:25,855 --> 00:16:29,951
This I think for us unspoken to just

293
00:16:30,463 --> 00:16:31,999
"Hägring 38"

294
00:16:34,559 --> 00:16:37,631
It is a novel that with Helsinki as a fund

295
00:16:37,887 --> 00:16:41,215
Played in the year 1938.

296
00:16:41,727 --> 00:16:45.567
And as you make a shocking fate drama of,

297
00:16:45,823 --> 00:16:50,175
If any people in the Finnish -Swedish bourgeoisie living in a time

298
00:16:50,431 --> 00:16:51,199
as

299
00:16:51,711 --> 00:16:56.575
Is uncomfortably similar to our own but you do not write the reader on the nose. Which makes it even more

300
00:16:56,831 --> 00:16:57,599
Effective.

301
00:16:58,623 --> 00:17:01,183
And there the dream of purity and community

302
00:17:01,439 --> 00:17:02,975
brought the world to the edge of the abyss.

303
00:17:06,815 --> 00:17:12,959
Those among you out there in cyber space that to adventure not

304
00:17:13,215 --> 00:17:14,239
read “Hägring 38”

305
00:17:14,495 --> 00:17:16,031
can i promise you have a

306
00:17:16,287 --> 00:17:18,847
Completely decisive reading experience ahead of you.

307
00:17:20,127 --> 00:17:23,711
That novel is an artistic complete testimony

308
00:17:24,223 --> 00:17:28,575
about the ambivalence as right and position on the major questions of time,

309
00:17:29,087 --> 00:17:30,111
an obligation.

310
00:17:32,415 --> 00:17:35,743
In your “work diary” from the

311
00:17:36,255 --> 00:17:39,327
years you worked with “Hägring 38” which is now

312
00:17:39,583 --> 00:17:42,655
afterword in the new edition

313
00:17:43,167 --> 00:17:48,287
How to describe your difficulties and efforts to find the right path into the story

314
00:17:48,799 --> 00:17:51,615
About lawyer Thune and the other gentlemen in the Wednesday Club,

315
00:17:52,127 --> 00:17:53,663
that discussion forum

316
00:17:54,175 --> 00:17:55,967
The story revolves around.

317
00:17:56,991 --> 00:18:00.575
You complain that the scenes lacked charge and forward movement as

318
00:18:00,831 --> 00:18:03,391
the thriller -like intrigue requires,

319
00:18:03,647 --> 00:18:09,279
Until you shifted the focus from the gentlemen to Thunes secretary, Matilda Wiik.

320
00:18:10,303 --> 00:18:13,631
That gets haunted by memories from the civil war starvation

321
00:18:13,887 --> 00:18:15,167
When she was a young girl.

322
00:18:15,679 --> 00:18:19,263
This is when you realize that you have to shorten the time shaft

323
00:18:19,519 --> 00:18:21,055
For the story now.

324
00:18:22,335 --> 00:18:22,847
You write:

325
00:18:23,615 --> 00:18:27,967
I have stretched the time shaft as a chewing gum and placed the scenes too far apart.

326
00:18:29,759 --> 00:18:32,831
Instead, you let Matilda in the opening scene

327
00:18:33,087 --> 00:18:36,159
ride a tram through the city after the end of the work day

328
00:18:36,415 --> 00:18:38,719
with their little everyday dreams

329
00:18:38,975 --> 00:18:41,279
and secrets that are also

330
00:18:41,535 --> 00:18:42.047
Finland.

331
00:18:44,095 --> 00:18:48,703
I will return to this with the importance of the time axis for your novel construction but

332
00:18:48,959 --> 00:18:49,983
first set a perhaps

333
00:18:50,239 --> 00:18:51,775
some naive question.

334
00:18:53,055 --> 00:18:59,199
Is the foundation and rough work of creating root systems for the background stories that make the people you depict

335
00:18:59,455 --> 00:19:00,479
three -dimensional,

336
00:19:00,991 --> 00:19:04,319
so that they think, speak, act and react

337
00:19:04,831 --> 00:19:08.415
both in a unique personal and at the same time timely way,

338
00:19:09,183 --> 00:19:10,975
that they do not become anachronistic,

339
00:19:11,743 --> 00:19:16,607
Does that work become more extensive the more distant in time

340
00:19:16,863 --> 00:19:18,143
A story is played out?

341
00:19:18,911 --> 00:19:20,959
Attorney Tune counter

342
00:19:21,215 --> 00:19:25,055
Thomas Brander, the star conductor who is the main character in your new novel "Tritonus"?

343
00:19:27,359 --> 00:19:28,383
The answer is yes.

344
00:19:28,639 --> 00:19:30,175
I have written

345
00:19:30,431 --> 00:19:30,943
partly

346
00:19:31,199 --> 00:19:33,759
the kind of novels such as “Hägring 38”

347
00:19:34,015 --> 00:19:37,087
represents and for example the novel "where we once went"

348
00:19:37,599 --> 00:19:41,183
I have written about the early 1900s that I

349
00:19:41,439 --> 00:19:45.535
Obviously, not having any experience of my own because I was born in 1961.

350
00:19:46,047 --> 00:19:48,095
Research is more demanding

351
00:19:48,351 --> 00:19:49,631
than when I write

352
00:19:50,143 --> 00:19:56.031
The second main type of novels I have written that have sometimes been pure contemporary novels such as "Tritonus".

353
00:19:56,543 --> 00:20:01,407
Or as novels that take off in, for example, 1950s and 60s and late

354
00:20:02,175 --> 00:20:04,479
moves through the decades until the present.

355
00:20:04,735 --> 00:20:09,599
It's easier. It requires a lot of research as well and the risk of anachronisms and

356
00:20:09,855 --> 00:20:15,999
Failure with time depiction also exists when writing about a time you have experienced yourself. There is

357
00:20:16,255 --> 00:20:18,047
A trap in that you may think it is too easy.

358
00:20:18,559 --> 00:20:21,375
The memory is deceitful.

359
00:20:24,703 --> 00:20:28,543
But in some sense it is easier to have your own pictures

360
00:20:29,823 --> 00:20:33,407
A separate visual world to pour out. When you then write about,

361
00:20:33,919 --> 00:20:35,711
The farther behind it goes there is there,

362
00:20:36,223 --> 00:20:37,503
There are like traps

363
00:20:38,271 --> 00:20:42,879
Already in everyday life. Things you might not think about having to ...

364
00:20:43,135 --> 00:20:47,231
It's not just about studying the so -called great story, knowing

365
00:20:47,487 --> 00:20:53,375
What the political developments looked like, the big lines. It is also about that

366
00:20:53,887 --> 00:20:56,959
Learn to understand how people's everyday lives saw.

367
00:20:57,215 --> 00:20:59,690
And it is demanding.

368
00:21:01,823 --> 00:21:03,103
I am doing a novel

369
00:21:03,359 --> 00:21:07.711
that takes place in early January 1940

370
00:21:08,223 --> 00:21:09,759
This banging winter

371
00:21:10,015 --> 00:21:15,135
Cch when I had written 20 pages and was actually not in Finland but in Stockholm,

372
00:21:15,647 --> 00:21:20,000
Had I assumed that Sweden had already started to darken then

373
00:21:20,256 --> 00:21:21,024
their cities.

374
00:21:21,536 --> 00:21:22.304
Until I suddenly found

375
00:21:22,560 --> 00:21:26,144
a source where it emerged that you only test dark

376
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:30,240
during some short periods in 1940.

377
00:21:30,752 --> 00:21:32,032
Then I have to write about

378
00:21:32,288 --> 00:21:38,432
the entire section and light the street lights and remove the blackout curtains.

379
00:21:38,688 --> 00:21:39,968
This type of trap is there.

380
00:21:40,224 --> 00:21:43,040
There I have an awful admiration for

381
00:21:43,808 --> 00:21:49,184
Author who depicts Bellman's life or Emperor Hadrian.

382
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:55,072
I do not experience problems with the historical because I still move so close to modern times.

383
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:58,144
My admiration for those who can write

384
00:21:58,912 --> 00:22:04,032
whether the Viking Age or if the Middle Ages or if the Renaissance is very large.

385
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:09,920
There, like the distance between our everyday lives and their everyday lives, is still greater.

386
00:22:10,688 --> 00:22:12,992
You would probably appreciate

387
00:22:13,248 --> 00:22:15.808
Very deep Ernst Brunners

388
00:22:16,576 --> 00:22:20,416
suite

389
00:22:21,184 --> 00:22:24,000
About the 18th century, Anckarström,

390
00:22:24,512 --> 00:22:25,536
Sergel.

391
00:22:27,328 --> 00:22:30,144
It's a long line of novels that

392
00:22:32,704 --> 00:22:34,240
which is literally very high.

393
00:22:34,752 --> 00:22:39,104
I have read one, the one about Bellman I have read and it thought I was amazing.

394
00:22:41,152 --> 00:22:43,968
The latest about Sergel, the "marble morm"

395
00:22:45,248 --> 00:22:46,528
I think the best so far.

396
00:22:50,112 --> 00:22:54,464
Another danger, I can imagine, with the nearby or

397
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:56,512
the rather nearby

398
00:22:58,048 --> 00:23:00.096
the end 60s,

399
00:23:00,352 --> 00:23:04,192
when I was young. I'm born 50, I had perfect timing

400
00:23:04,448 --> 00:23:07.008
For the late 60's. I was 12

401
00:23:07,264 --> 00:23:08,288
When the Beatles came up

402
00:23:08,544 --> 00:23:10,592
On ten-in-top with Love Me Do.

403
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:16,992
All the way, the Beatles were like a metronome

404
00:23:17,504 --> 00:23:18,272
as

405
00:23:18,528 --> 00:23:22,624
Made me keep the pace in my way to the adult world.

406
00:23:23,904 --> 00:23:25,184
Then you were 17 years old when

407
00:23:25,696 --> 00:23:31,840
The festival in Monterey, 19 years when Woodstock was ...

408
00:23:32,096 --> 00:23:35,680
I sometimes got the question then when I wrote novels about the 60s and 70s,

409
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:37,680
If I have been born any other Åe or in any other epoch,

410
00:23:41,568 --> 00:23:43,104
When would I like to be born?

411
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:47,968
Then I answer for a while that I would have liked to have been born ten years earlier, ie 195.

412
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:50,272
So had I been a teenager

413
00:23:50,784 --> 00:23:54,112
When everything happened in the music, for example in the 60s.

414
00:23:54,368 --> 00:23:57,440
So I usually add that I have a very weak character and

415
00:23:57,440 --> 00:24:01.024
is quite moody and easy to influence

416
00:24:01,280 --> 00:24:02.304
so i think too i

417
00:24:02,560 --> 00:24:04.096
were rescued from flipping out

418
00:24:04,864 --> 00:24:08.961
in different ways by being born ten years later.

419
00:24:10,496 --> 00:24:12,800
Another danger may be that

420
00:24:13,056 --> 00:24:13.568
MAN

421
00:24:13,824 --> 00:24:16,128
Getting so fond

422
00:24:16,384 --> 00:24:18,176
A era like it!

423
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:19,968
That you,

424
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:22,016
If one is not yourself

425
00:24:22,528 --> 00:24:25,088
Has your own experiences

426
00:24:26,368 --> 00:24:27,136
Right timed

427
00:24:27,648 --> 00:24:29,440
so can you rely

428
00:24:29,696 --> 00:24:31,232
The story with

429
00:24:31,488 --> 00:24:34.560
Time markers so that the story

430
00:24:35,072 --> 00:24:38,400
suffocated by all decor and props.

431
00:24:41,216 --> 00:24:44,032
That danger must well one

432
00:24:44,288 --> 00:24:45,824
writer like you as

433
00:24:46,592 --> 00:24:48,640
depicts the entire 20th century

434
00:24:49,152 --> 00:24:50,176
In Helsinki HA?

435
00:24:50,688 --> 00:24:56,832
I think I made these mistakes in the beginning. If I were to write about my first novel "the dragons over

436
00:24:57,088 --> 00:24:57,600
Helsinki"

437
00:24:58,112 --> 00:25:04,256
Should I use slightly fewer music markers. There is so much Led Zeppelin and Beatles and stuff.

438
00:25:05,024 --> 00:25:06.304
For a human being

439
00:25:06,560 --> 00:25:10,400
of an older generation or a clearly younger generation so it gets a little

440
00:25:11,936 --> 00:25:12,960
Strangering

441
00:25:13,472 --> 00:25:15,776
almost. So much time markers.

442
00:25:15,776 --> 00:25:17,824
An exciting thing is to

443
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:21,152
I had a theory that realistically placed writers

444
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:22,944
often think it

445
00:25:23,456 --> 00:25:25,504
epoch or the decade

446
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:26,784
As they have been children

447
00:25:27,296 --> 00:25:28,832
is the most magical there is.

448
00:25:29,344 --> 00:25:31,136
And for me, it's the 60s.

449
00:25:31,392 --> 00:25:37,280
However, I have always failed, I think, or at least partially failed, by portraying

450
00:25:37,536 --> 00:25:38,816
It 1980s

451
00:25:39,328 --> 00:25:40,352
where I myself was

452
00:25:40,864 --> 00:25:41,376
Young.

453
00:25:42,144 --> 00:25:43,680
When I read it

454
00:25:44,448 --> 00:25:46,496
Here in winter winter Lydia Sandgren's "Collected works",

455
00:25:47,264 --> 00:25:49.568
she is so young so she

456
00:25:49,824 --> 00:25:52,128
was born in the shift between the 80s and 90s.

457
00:25:52,384 --> 00:25:53,920
She portrays the 80s

458
00:25:54,432 --> 00:25:56,480
with the same feeling for the magic of the 80's

459
00:25:56,992 --> 00:25:58,016
As I always have

460
00:25:58,784 --> 00:26:01.856
Viljat achieved and hoped to have achieved with the 60s.

461
00:26:02,368 --> 00:26:08,512
While I have thought, what the 80s, what is there to portray there?

462
00:26:08,512 --> 00:26:13,097
Suddenly there is where the shimmer and magic there.

463
00:26:15,168 --> 00:26:17,984
It is an outstanding debut.

464
00:26:20,288 --> 00:26:23,360
We read historical novels even

465
00:26:23,616 --> 00:26:26,688
counterfactic. I read here

466
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:31,296
the French writer Laurent Binet's novel "Civilization",

467
00:26:31,808 --> 00:26:36,672
a counterfactic novel where he turns on this colonial history steak

468
00:26:37,184 --> 00:26:41,536
and sounds an incentive on the run after a defeat in a war of throne

469
00:26:41,792 --> 00:26:43,072
lay down

470
00:26:43,328 --> 00:26:45,169
in the 1530s.

471
00:26:45,376 --> 00:26:46,656
We read

472
00:26:47,424 --> 00:26:49,728
All historical novels with the facts in hand.

473
00:26:50,752 --> 00:26:51,776
But

474
00:26:52,032 --> 00:26:57,920
The fact that, unlike the Roman designs, we know how it will end is not a problem in itself.

475
00:26:58,432 --> 00:26:59,712
On the contrary, increases

476
00:27:00,224 --> 00:27:03.808
the power of power for the people you read about,

477
00:27:04,064 --> 00:27:08.928
Before their confusion and the future fate of the world, the story's charge for me.

478
00:27:10,208 --> 00:27:14,304
As we said before, culturally impronged elements today

479
00:27:14,560 --> 00:27:17,120
will be threat to the people's tribe tomorrow

480
00:27:17,376 --> 00:27:20,960
And become sub -people who must be eradicated the day after tomorrow.

481
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:23,008
That's how we know that

482
00:27:23,008 --> 00:27:24,764
It was what happened.

483
00:27:25,056 --> 00:27:27,616
And in “the sulfur yellow sky”

484
00:27:27,872 --> 00:27:30,688
takes your nameless storyteller with the reader

485
00:27:30,944 --> 00:27:31,456
on a

486
00:27:31,968 --> 00:27:36,064
Absolutely incredible journey from it ended the sixties, which was mine,

487
00:27:36,832 --> 00:27:40,160
to our time as you call, I quote,

488
00:27:40,672 --> 00:27:46.560
"A black future cave where the violence and the upcoming wars moved like flickering shadows".

489
00:27:49,376 --> 00:27:50,400
Is it then

490
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:54,752
For you an obligation

491
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:57.568
for the art, for you as a writer

492
00:27:57,824 --> 00:27:59,872
Which is bigger than the art?

493
00:28:00,896 --> 00:28:05.359
A direct responsibility for the story?

494
00:28:07,040 --> 00:28:10,880
It is a very difficult issue, an important issue.

495
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:14,208
I have had periods in my life and some of me

496
00:28:14,976 --> 00:28:19,328
Want to say that sometimes think that you are yourself enough.

497
00:28:20,096 --> 00:28:22,656
I was fascinated by novels when I was

498
00:28:23,424 --> 00:28:27,264
children or like a teenager and start reading them and not had

499
00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:29,312
The smallest plan to write them yourself.

500
00:28:29,568 --> 00:28:32,640
I devoted much of my life to them and

501
00:28:33,152 --> 00:28:34,176
is very

502
00:28:34,688 --> 00:28:36,480
long prepared to defend

503
00:28:36,992 --> 00:28:39,040
The novel in its own right, so to speak.

504
00:28:39,808 --> 00:28:40,832
But at the same time,

505
00:28:41,856 --> 00:28:43,392
I have a journalist background,

506
00:28:43,904 --> 00:28:46,208
I have always been deeply interested in history,

507
00:28:46,976 --> 00:28:53,120
I am also a political man, a political writer in some sense, even if I am not

508
00:28:53,376 --> 00:28:54,144
party political or

509
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:58,240
pronounced ideological.

510
00:28:58,752 --> 00:29:00,544
Whether I write historically

511
00:29:01,056 --> 00:29:02,592
About the 20th century

512
00:29:03,872 --> 00:29:06,944
horrors and wrongdoing or more in contemporary

513
00:29:07,456 --> 00:29:08,992
I feel that one has one

514
00:29:10,272 --> 00:29:12,320
Responsibility as a realistic novelist.

515
00:29:13,088 --> 00:29:14,624
For example, when I write about

516
00:29:16,160 --> 00:29:22.304
Finland's 20th century history that was so complex and complicated and so brutal. We first had a civil war

517
00:29:23,072 --> 00:29:25,376
where we also got free from Russia

518
00:29:25,632 --> 00:29:29,472
and then were forced to fight two wars against the Soviet Union and then

519
00:29:30,496 --> 00:29:31,520
must

520
00:29:31,776 --> 00:29:36,128
our tired army in 1944-45 chase out wehrmacht out

521
00:29:36,384 --> 00:29:38,432
Lapland. That story

522
00:29:38,944 --> 00:29:40,736
are so complex and bloody and

523
00:29:42,016 --> 00:29:46,112
have influenced all families and families in Finland, there are none

524
00:29:46,368 --> 00:29:47,136
related or family that goes free

525
00:29:47,392 --> 00:29:49,952
or has avoided being affected

526
00:29:50,208 --> 00:29:54.304
of this. This means that when you write about those times you have a responsibility.

527
00:29:55,072 --> 00:29:57,632
You find and you fabricate.

528
00:29:58,400 --> 00:29:59,680
But I have been very careful

529
00:29:59,936 --> 00:30:00,960
Think so ...

530
00:30:01,984 --> 00:30:03,264
I've ever answered,

531
00:30:03,776 --> 00:30:04,288
Or said

532
00:30:05,056 --> 00:30:06,592
that I write about events,

533
00:30:07,616 --> 00:30:10,944
I use a plausibility theory.

534
00:30:11,456 --> 00:30:15,040
I am writing about events that could have happened, which in all likelihood

535
00:30:15,296 --> 00:30:16,576
Has also happened.

536
00:30:17,344 --> 00:30:20,160
So you have a responsibility.

537
00:30:20,928 --> 00:30:25,024
I would not be able to, for example, become a historical satirist,

538
00:30:25,280 --> 00:30:26,816
Write a historical satire.

539
00:30:28,096 --> 00:30:30,656
I see where I go deep in the people and

540
00:30:31,424 --> 00:30:35,520
My people are fictional but they are founded in that book I write about.

541
00:30:36,032 --> 00:30:39,360
And I sincerely hope I make them and the book fair.

542
00:30:40,384 --> 00:30:42,432
One of the major challenges is,

543
00:30:42,688 --> 00:30:45,504
For example, not to apply our time of aftermath

544
00:30:46,784 --> 00:30:47,296
on

545
00:30:48,576 --> 00:30:50,112
The story you write.

546
00:30:50,368 --> 00:30:51,648
When I for example

547
00:30:52,416 --> 00:30:54,464
wrote "Hägring 38" so is

548
00:30:54,976 --> 00:30:56,000
several of these

549
00:30:56,512 --> 00:30:58.560
The men in the Wednesday Club,

550
00:30:59,328 --> 00:31:03,936
They lean strongly to the right and are even Nazi attached. They do not have the facts on hand.

551
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:06,752
It is easy to judge them afterwards but

552
00:31:07,520 --> 00:31:11,616
In countries such as Finland and Sweden in the late 1930s had the bourgeoisie

553
00:31:12,896 --> 00:31:15,712
Old connections to Germany.

554
00:31:15,968 --> 00:31:18,784
Germany had been the cultural nation par Excellence

555
00:31:19,296 --> 00:31:20,832
Together with France

556
00:31:21,088 --> 00:31:22,624
in Europe.

557
00:31:23,648 --> 00:31:25,440
After the Versaille peace.

558
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:31,072
It made people not ... it contributed to blindness

559
00:31:31,584 --> 00:31:33,120
In front of what Hitler's Germany

560
00:31:33,376 --> 00:31:34,144
Actually was.

561
00:31:34,656 --> 00:31:37,472
For many things went up far too late.

562
00:31:38,752 --> 00:31:42,848
I have to write these figures. I remember some sentences I wrote

563
00:31:44,384 --> 00:31:46,176
felt rugged to write

564
00:31:46,432 --> 00:31:46,944
in order to

565
00:31:47,712 --> 00:31:49,760
I have to write them without facts on hand.

566
00:31:51,040 --> 00:31:51,552
As I have.

567
00:31:52,064 --> 00:31:54,112
That is, the Nazi regime was

568
00:31:55,136 --> 00:31:56,416
closest to total evil.

569
00:31:58,464 --> 00:32:04.608
Sometimes and now here during the conversation I start getting for me

570
00:32:04,864 --> 00:32:07.936
that you have chopped into my brain to

571
00:32:08,448 --> 00:32:12,288
it leads step by step along the path

572
00:32:12,800 --> 00:32:14,080
As I have cleared up.

573
00:32:21,248 --> 00:32:23,040
May I postpone one thing, Laurence Binet's book "Civilizations",

574
00:32:23,296 --> 00:32:28,160
I have read reviews of that book in the Swedish Press and it exists

575
00:32:28,416 --> 00:32:30,976
high up on my reading list because I have all my

576
00:32:31,488 --> 00:32:33,024
Life, I read as a child,

577
00:32:33,280 --> 00:32:37,120
There was some boy book series that was played on the Yucatan Peninsula

578
00:32:37,888 --> 00:32:38,656
In Mexico?

579
00:32:39,168 --> 00:32:39,680
Yes!

580
00:32:39,936 --> 00:32:41,984
I don't remember what the hero was called

581
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:44,544
But that boy book series made a deep ...

582
00:32:45,056 --> 00:32:45.568
Yukan!

583
00:32:45,824 --> 00:32:46,336
Exactly!

584
00:32:47,104 --> 00:32:50,944
And it read it and it aroused an interest in me that has kept in his whole life

585
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:52,224
that way is to me

586
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:55,040
have read copiously with books on both inkor,

587
00:32:55,552 --> 00:32:58,112
Mayor and Aztecs.

588
00:32:58,368 --> 00:33:03,536
And also even older cultures.

589
00:33:03,792 --> 00:33:05,536
I wrote about "civilizations" in the Post of Gothenburg

590
00:33:06,304 --> 00:33:09.791
You can probably find that if you google.

591
00:33:13,984 --> 00:33:17,056
That the Inka culture would have invaded Europe

592
00:33:17,312 --> 00:33:20,128
in the 16th century and applied their

593
00:33:20,384 --> 00:33:23,968
Norms, it's fascinating, I want to see what Binet has done from it.

594
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:26,784
Yes, it's a lot of fun, it's entertaining.

595
00:33:27,040 --> 00:33:29,600
There is a lot about Umberto Eco.

596
00:33:29,856 --> 00:33:32,160
Now we're going to have fun with the story and

597
00:33:32,416 --> 00:33:38.560
Sometimes it runs away and the historical references and parallelizations and

598
00:33:38,816 --> 00:33:39,328
the reversals

599
00:33:39,584 --> 00:33:40,608
will end up

600
00:33:41,120 --> 00:33:43,680
Some too many.

601
00:33:43,680 --> 00:33:46,496
But it is a very schwung,

602
00:33:47,008 --> 00:33:52,128
And just like in your novels, enormously throughout.

603
00:33:57,248 --> 00:34:00.064
He is a relatively new writer so he ...

604
00:34:00,576 --> 00:34:03,392
You can give him the Benefit of the Doubt, in terms of self -delight.

605
00:34:05,440 --> 00:34:08,000
Avoiding self -delight takes a whole author life.

606
00:34:08,512 --> 00:34:11,584
Yes!

607
00:34:13,120 --> 00:34:17,984
When we get into this with solidarity towards

608
00:34:18,496 --> 00:34:20,800
the characters, the people,

609
00:34:21,312 --> 00:34:22,592
your figures,

610
00:34:23,104 --> 00:34:24,384
as

611
00:34:24,640 --> 00:34:25,664
is one of your

612
00:34:25,920 --> 00:34:27,200
Main characteristic as a writer.

613
00:34:30,272 --> 00:34:36,416
It is absolutely crucial to me as a reader, my conviction is that the art, the literature

614
00:34:36,672 --> 00:34:41,792
can give a deeper understanding of history and our own location

615
00:34:42,304 --> 00:34:43,840
In the ongoing story,

616
00:34:44,608 --> 00:34:45,888
by shaping

617
00:34:47,680 --> 00:34:50,752
individual unique people's fate on their own terms.

618
00:34:51,776 --> 00:34:56,640
To see the world and time from within with their eyes

619
00:34:56,896 --> 00:35:00.992
in all their complexity and deficiency.

620
00:35:00,992 --> 00:35:02,784
Lars Ahlin formulated

621
00:35:03,040 --> 00:35:04,576
The artistic solidarity

622
00:35:05,344 --> 00:35:07,392
with the people being embodied

623
00:35:08,160 --> 00:35:08,672
like this:

624
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:12,768
"It is important to exceed without abandoning."

625
00:35:15,840 --> 00:35:20,448
What is your opinion of this? Do you share that view of the author as the narrator's task?

626
00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:25,312
Or have I just projected my own conviction of the art's and literature

627
00:35:25,568 --> 00:35:26,080
role

628
00:35:26,080 --> 00:35:28,384
On your novels?

629
00:35:28,785 --> 00:35:32,992
I don't think so, I think we share

630
00:35:32,992 --> 00:35:33,504
sight there.

631
00:35:34,893 --> 00:35:38,368
You never know yourself as an artist and as

632
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:41,696
writer how far one succeeds but I know

633
00:35:42,208 --> 00:35:43,744
What a pursuit I have.

634
00:35:44,256 --> 00:35:45,792
And it's been ...

635
00:35:46,048 --> 00:35:47,328
to be unconditional.

636
00:35:48,352 --> 00:35:50,400
It is more difficult to be solidarity against

637
00:35:50,912 --> 00:35:57,056
The novels' Bad Guys and Bad Girls than against Good Guys but I work very much with gray zones

638
00:35:58,080 --> 00:35:59,872
And shades.

639
00:36:00,384 --> 00:36:01.408
I think very much

640
00:36:01,664 --> 00:36:02.944
Hard to

641
00:36:03,712 --> 00:36:06.016
also the tastiest of people has

642
00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:13,184
Strokes of pain in themselves. Also that man almost always has a good line in itself.

643
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:15,488
This complexity

644
00:36:16,256 --> 00:36:18,816
I always try to get out, and more and more indeed.

645
00:36:19,328 --> 00:36:20,608
The more years have passed.

646
00:36:21,376 --> 00:36:22,656
My novels may have,

647
00:36:24,448 --> 00:36:29.568
Maybe my past novels had a little more like musty anecdotes

648
00:36:29,824 --> 00:36:31,616
than my latter have.

649
00:36:31,872 --> 00:36:33,664
I have sacrificed the anecdotes

650
00:36:34,176 --> 00:36:36,480
In an endeavor to get deeper,

651
00:36:36,736 --> 00:36:38,528
So go vertically to the person.

652
00:36:39,040 --> 00:36:41,088
That's what I can feel now when I

653
00:36:41,344 --> 00:36:42,624
turns 60 this summer.

654
00:36:43,392 --> 00:36:49,536
I think I have some really good novels in me yet but may not be infinitely many.

655
00:36:49,536 --> 00:36:54,144
So the pursuit I have left and where I want to reach even further is to reach even deeper in the people.

656
00:36:55,680 --> 00:36:57,472
Whether I write in the present,

657
00:36:57,728 --> 00:36:59.008
in the same time or if I

658
00:36:59,264 --> 00:37:00.032
writes historically.

659
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:02,080
Then I can be 10 years old,

660
00:37:02,848 --> 00:37:04,128
11 years

661
00:37:04,896 --> 00:37:06,176
minus

662
00:37:06,432 --> 00:37:07.712
10 days

663
00:37:07,968 --> 00:37:11,296
Older than you are, certify that your novels

664
00:37:11,552 --> 00:37:14,624
know more about aging

665
00:37:15,136 --> 00:37:21,024
than you do yourself. It is not something you recommend to young people.

666
00:37:25,120 --> 00:37:26,144
That is very nice,

667
00:37:27,168 --> 00:37:27,936
It's like,

668
00:37:28,448 --> 00:37:30,752
It is also one thing that in some way was the point

669
00:37:31,008 --> 00:37:34,592
For me with narrative, ie with novels and short stories.

670
00:37:35,872 --> 00:37:38,176
When I start in an early short story,

671
00:37:38,432 --> 00:37:42,528
After all, I started as a novelist, had to give two short stories before the first novel came,

672
00:37:43,040 --> 00:37:44,576
Already in the short stories I had

673
00:37:45,344 --> 00:37:48,928
An experience, now I wrote something I didn't know I was thinking.

674
00:37:49,696 --> 00:37:53,536
The story reveals itself as wiser than I am.

675
00:37:54,304 --> 00:37:58,144
I still feel that is in the story. To the novel

676
00:37:59,936 --> 00:38:01.216
becomes wiser.

677
00:38:01,728 --> 00:38:05.056
In favorable cases, the novel becomes wiser than the rather

678
00:38:05,824 --> 00:38:07,360
Pope person who has written it.

679
00:38:09,152 --> 00:38:11,456
Absolutely true!

680
00:38:11,968 --> 00:38:13,504
It is actually

681
00:38:14,272 --> 00:38:18,112
The smallest common denominator for all interesting authorship.

682
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:22,464
To those as with

683
00:38:23,488 --> 00:38:24,512
Lars Ahlin

684
00:38:24,768 --> 00:38:26,048
exceeds without abandoning.

685
00:38:28,352 --> 00:38:29,632
Yes, it is very nice.

686
00:38:29,888 --> 00:38:36,032
I have read some of Lars Ahlin but I did not know that quote, it is very nice.

687
00:38:36,288 --> 00:38:38,592
He has also written "Write weakly about the weak"

688
00:38:38,592 --> 00:38:42,688
Lars Ahlin is for me one of the absolute

689
00:38:42,944 --> 00:38:46,016
Biggest, ever at all.

690
00:38:48,064 --> 00:38:50,112
When you get as old as I

691
00:38:50,368 --> 00:38:53,075
So you will appreciate it.

692
00:38:57,792 --> 00:38:59,584
Then it was this with the time axis again

693
00:39:01,888 --> 00:39:03,424
In yours

694
00:39:04,704 --> 00:39:10,848
Open letters to Juha Itkonen you write that you started writing

695
00:39:11,104 --> 00:39:12,896
your new novel "Tritonus"

696
00:39:13,664 --> 00:39:14,432
Autumn

697
00:39:14,688 --> 00:39:19,552
16 and knew from the beginning that you wanted to place the story in the border zone

698
00:39:19,808 --> 00:39:22,600
between present and future.

699
00:39:22,600 --> 00:39:26,720
The novel was virtually finished already in January

700
00:39:27,232 --> 00:39:28,512
2020

701
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:34,144
But when the Corona epidemic turns from threat to reality, you write,

702
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:36,960
Did you have to do something for the novel's

703
00:39:37,216 --> 00:39:37,728
Time axis.

704
00:39:39,776 --> 00:39:43,872
Here's how you write: I immediately realized that a 2020 without the pandemic, there is.

705
00:39:44,384 --> 00:39:45,920
Not anywhere in the world.

706
00:39:46,688 --> 00:39:48,480
So I started reworking the time shaft.

707
00:39:49,248 --> 00:39:50,784
I didn't just move it,

708
00:39:51,040 --> 00:39:51.808
I also stretched

709
00:39:52,064 --> 00:39:53,856
out it in time to a vague

710
00:39:54,112 --> 00:39:55,392
Postpandemic time there

711
00:39:55,648 --> 00:39:56,928
Fear still

712
00:39:57,440 --> 00:39:57,952
Pyr.

713
00:39:58,976 --> 00:39:59,744
In other words,

714
00:40:00,512 --> 00:40:02.816
in historical novels

715
00:40:04,608 --> 00:40:05,632
through research

716
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:07,680
Do you do background studies

717
00:40:08,448 --> 00:40:11,008
to saturate your characters.

718
00:40:11,264 --> 00:40:17,408
In this contemporary story you give the nerve and forward -looking energy

719
00:40:17,920 --> 00:40:18,688
by

720
00:40:18,944 --> 00:40:19,968
stretch

721
00:40:20,224 --> 00:40:21,504
The timeline in

722
00:40:22,016 --> 00:40:23,040
in a

723
00:40:24,832 --> 00:40:26,112
vague near future.

724
00:40:27,136 --> 00:40:28,416
This is, you write,

725
00:40:28,672 --> 00:40:31,232
The most faustic I have had to do as a writer.

726
00:40:33,280 --> 00:40:34,816
I think many

727
00:40:35,072 --> 00:40:38,400
with me out there, in front of their computers and toads

728
00:40:38,656 --> 00:40:40,448
Like to hear you describe

729
00:40:40,960 --> 00:40:43,264
in which the faustic in the extended time axis consists,

730
00:40:44,288 --> 00:40:44,800
a little closer?

731
00:40:46,080 --> 00:40:46,848
It was like this,

732
00:40:47,104 --> 00:40:48,896
when the novel, as you just said

733
00:40:49,152 --> 00:40:52,480
or quoted me, low pre -written

734
00:40:53,760 --> 00:40:55.808
In January 2000,

735
00:40:56,320 --> 00:41:00,416
Then I have the habit of doing one last processing, often my books come out in August,

736
00:41:00,672 --> 00:41:06.304
September, then I do one last processing in the spring and it has almost always been purely linguistic.

737
00:41:07,072 --> 00:41:09.120
But now I sat with a contemporary novel there ...

738
00:41:10,144 --> 00:41:12,192
Tritonus is divided into a

739
00:41:12,448 --> 00:41:13,216
autumn department,

740
00:41:13,728 --> 00:41:16,800
Half of the book will be played in the fall from October to December.

741
00:41:17,312 --> 00:41:19,360
And the other half in summer

742
00:41:19,616 --> 00:41:20,896
In June, July.

743
00:41:21,408 --> 00:41:22,176
it was

744
00:41:22,688 --> 00:41:23,456
Yet in

745
00:41:23,712 --> 00:41:28,064
January 2020, it was autumn 2019 and summer 2020.

746
00:41:28,576 --> 00:41:31,136
The problem was only that summer 2020

747
00:41:31,648 --> 00:41:37,792
In my novel as it looked in raw version people went to sweaty gigs, gigs

748
00:41:38,048 --> 00:41:38,560
In the pub where it

749
00:41:38,816 --> 00:41:42,656
Local rock band The Rainbow played, they went to chamber music festivals.

750
00:41:43,168 --> 00:41:45,472
It was European football for men and Finland

751
00:41:45,984 --> 00:41:51,104
National team was present for the first time. There were references to it as well. I realized that this is not possible!

752
00:41:51,616 --> 00:41:52.640
Then I had worked

753
00:41:53,151 --> 00:41:56,223
for four years with this novel and absolutely did not want

754
00:41:56,735 --> 00:41:58,271
that it would go to waste.

755
00:41:58,783 --> 00:42:03.647
So I did the only thing possible, you can't, this is also one of the secrets of novel writing.

756
00:42:04,159 --> 00:42:05.695
Once you have created a path

757
00:42:05,951 --> 00:42:06,975
so you have entered

758
00:42:07,743 --> 00:42:13,375
Time also in the people, also in the subtitle, also between the lines. So you can't push the time back.

759
00:42:14,143 --> 00:42:18,751
But what could be done was stretching out the time shaft and moving the story.

760
00:42:19,007 --> 00:42:23,103
It still takes off in 2016, 2015

761
00:42:23,615 --> 00:42:26,431
And the terrorist attack in Brussels for example.

762
00:42:27,199 --> 00:42:30,527
As conductor Brander only escapes with distress and scarcity.

763
00:42:30,783 --> 00:42:35,903
So I simply reached it out so that it takes place in somewhere near future and when I wrote

764
00:42:36,159 --> 00:42:36,927
the story

765
00:42:37,183 --> 00:42:41.023
So I thought, okay this is maybe autumn 20 and summer 2.

766
00:42:41,535 --> 00:42:43,327
Then none of us knew,

767
00:42:43,583 --> 00:42:44,863
a year ago,

768
00:42:45,119 --> 00:42:46,911
That this pandemic would be ...

769
00:42:46,911 --> 00:42:49,471
Had we been historically

770
00:42:49,727 --> 00:42:54,726
Responsive, we had known that Spanish sickness was also ongoing for several years.

771
00:42:55,871 --> 00:42:58.943
But maybe we thought optimistically last spring that summer,

772
00:42:59,455 --> 00:43:00.223
Then this is over.

773
00:43:00,735 --> 00:43:05.343
Now it has dragged out on time, so now I think that "Tritonus" may be playing out

774
00:43:06,367 --> 00:43:09,183
Autumn 22, summer 23.

775
00:43:11,231 --> 00:43:14,559
Another factor

776
00:43:15,839 --> 00:43:18,143
that did that

777
00:43:19,423 --> 00:43:21,983
Not the light mind though

778
00:43:23,263 --> 00:43:25,823
The illusion of ours

779
00:43:26,079 --> 00:43:27,871
relative invulnerability,

780
00:43:28,639 --> 00:43:30,943
That the illusion

781
00:43:31,199 --> 00:43:32,223
Was born out

782
00:43:33,503 --> 00:43:38,111
The welfare society that Pandemin revealed had been demolished.

783
00:43:38,879 --> 00:43:39.903
And plundered out

784
00:43:40,159 --> 00:43:41,695
and was cut up and

785
00:43:42,975 --> 00:43:46,815
sold out to lowest bidder for 25 years.

786
00:43:47,071 --> 00:43:50,399
Now we suddenly saw that it did not hold. The dam did not hold.

787
00:43:50,911 --> 00:43:51,935
The dams burst.

788
00:43:52,703 --> 00:43:57,311
I think that also had a great influence on

789
00:43:57,567 --> 00:43:59,103
the Swedish

790
00:44:00,505 --> 00:44:05.247
Pandemist strategy.

791
00:44:05,247 --> 00:44:07,295
Matt it also had its material causes.

792
00:44:07,551 --> 00:44:08.063
This

793
00:44:08,063 --> 00:44:09.855
Mumlandet

794
00:44:09,855 --> 00:44:10,879
and

795
00:44:11,135 --> 00:44:12,415
The handcuff unit.

796
00:44:14,207 --> 00:44:14,719
Well...

797
00:44:14,975 --> 00:44:17,279
I would say, if I can comment,

798
00:44:18,559 --> 00:44:19,839
would I say that

799
00:44:20,607 --> 00:44:26,239
There has been so much revolving things in the world the latest

800
00:44:26,751 --> 00:44:29.567
the years but even before the pandemic

801
00:44:30,335 --> 00:44:35,711
explodes the climate crisis, which in itself has long existed in people's consciousness,

802
00:44:35,967 --> 00:44:39.807
Thanks in large part to Greta Thunberg.

803
00:44:40,319 --> 00:44:43,391
And these two things together,

804
00:44:43,903 --> 00:44:47.743
cutting awareness of the climate crisis of most of us

805
00:44:48,255 --> 00:44:50,559
and the pandemic, has done,

806
00:44:51,583 --> 00:44:53,119
At least I think that

807
00:44:54,911 --> 00:44:56.703
where we had come

808
00:44:57,471 --> 00:45:00,799
sometime in 2016, 2015, that human, r

809
00:45:01,567 --> 00:45:04,639
Many people with resources thought it was everyday

810
00:45:04,895 --> 00:45:05.407
to

811
00:45:05,919 --> 00:45:07.455
Go on five days

812
00:45:07.711 --> 00:45:10.015
Weekly holidays to Bali or

813
00:45:10,271 --> 00:45:13,855
Constantly new big cities around the world.

814
00:45:14,111 --> 00:45:15,647
We had built something that

815
00:45:16,415 --> 00:45:19,999
could not hold. We would remember that there was something that was built for

816
00:45:20,255 --> 00:45:23,583
Hardly even a per thousand of the people of the world. It was the richest minority.

817
00:45:25,119 --> 00:45:26,399
That promil

818
00:45:26,655 --> 00:45:27,679
liver

819
00:45:27,935 --> 00:45:29,983
on borrowed money, on borrowed time.

820
00:45:33,055 --> 00:45:35,871
Alex Schulman wrote a pretty nice column,

821
00:45:36,639 --> 00:45:39,199
Where is he writing, is it in Expressen?

822
00:45:39,199 --> 00:45:39.711
Yes

823
00:45:39,711 --> 00:45:44,063
Just a few weeks ago when it has the giant container had settled across the Suez Canal

824
00:45:44,319 --> 00:45:48,415
He wrote that it was the ultimate picture for what we have done.

825
00:45:48,671 --> 00:45:49,439
We built

826
00:45:49,695 --> 00:45:50,975
a ship so large that it is not accommodated

827
00:45:51,743 --> 00:45:53,535
Worldwide.

828
00:45:57,375 --> 00:45:58,399
One of

829
00:45:58,911 --> 00:46:00.447
your features

830
00:46:01,215 --> 00:46:03,519
as a writer

831
00:46:04,287 --> 00:46:05.055
is

832
00:46:05,311 --> 00:46:06,079
that you

833
00:46:08,127 --> 00:46:09.663
Never write

834
00:46:11,199 --> 00:46:12,735
The reader on the nose

835
00:46:12,991 --> 00:46:14,783
Without establishing

836
00:46:15,039 --> 00:46:17,343
your time rooms and your characters

837
00:46:17,599 --> 00:46:18,367
indirectly

838
00:46:19,903 --> 00:46:20,671
Like after all

839
00:46:20,927 --> 00:46:22,463
Life works.

840
00:46:23,487 --> 00:46:27,327
They are there with their experiences, with their dreams,

841
00:46:27,583 --> 00:46:30,655
with their failures, with their confusion.

842
00:46:31,679 --> 00:46:34,239
And that is what makes them three -dimensional.

843
00:46:35,263 --> 00:46:36,287
You're not talking about

844
00:46:36,799 --> 00:46:39,359
that this is a human being that

845
00:46:41,151 --> 00:46:42,687
is confused and not

846
00:46:42,943 --> 00:46:44,223
know ...

847
00:46:44,991 --> 00:46:49,599
And faces a situation that he or she cannot master.

848
00:46:50,367 --> 00:46:54,975
The indirect way you establish.

849
00:46:55,487 --> 00:46:59,327
This way of establishing your characters and your stories indirectly

850
00:46:59,583 --> 00:47:02.655
Do you show in the introduction to

851
00:47:02,911 --> 00:47:03,679
"Tritonus"

852
00:47:04,191 --> 00:47:05.215
where I

853
00:47:05,471 --> 00:47:07.007
have asked you to read up

854
00:47:07,263 --> 00:47:10,000
A section to demonstrate this.

855
00:47:10,079 --> 00:47:10,847
I'll do that.

856
00:47:15,199 --> 00:47:16,991
Here is a short section from the beginning of the novel "Tritonus"

857
00:47:18,015 --> 00:47:19,807
The beginning of subscription time

858
00:47:21,855 --> 00:47:22,623
A bit away

859
00:47:23,135 --> 00:47:24,159
Near the plot limit

860
00:47:24,415 --> 00:47:25,695
Low the sauna up on its rocky hob.

861
00:47:27,231 --> 00:47:28,511
It was not bad either

862
00:47:28,767 --> 00:47:31,327
With glass rooms and kitchenette and extra shower room.

863
00:47:32,351 --> 00:47:34,911
Branders childhood friend, architect Sandmark

864
00:47:35,167 --> 00:47:37,215
had also designed a whirlpool

865
00:47:37,471 --> 00:47:39,775
which has been cast into a sink into the mountain outside.

866
00:47:40,799 --> 00:47:43,871
Wide wooden stairs with solid rails led down to the beach and

867
00:47:44,127 --> 00:47:46,943
There were new coffin bridges at both guest cottage and sauna.

868
00:47:48,223 --> 00:47:50,783
The place had cost the fire 700,000 euros

869
00:47:51,295 --> 00:47:54,879
And after the new building and renovations it would be even more

870
00:47:55,135 --> 00:47:57,183
Although property prices have fallen significantly.

871
00:47:58,463 --> 00:48:01.023
He had a hard time understanding that he was still so rich

872
00:48:01,791 --> 00:48:04.607
And even harder to understand why it didn't make him happier.

873
00:48:05,887 --> 00:48:07.935
All he owned felt like someone else's

874
00:48:08,447 --> 00:48:09.471
and he wasn't happy

875
00:48:09,983 --> 00:48:11,007
But not afraid.

876
00:48:12,799 --> 00:48:15,615
When he opened the front door, a bat flew into the living room.

877
00:48:17,151 --> 00:48:18,943
At first he thought it was a little bird.

878
00:48:20,479 --> 00:48:23,039
But it was the wrong kind of silence and the wrong kind of wing bat.

879
00:48:23,807 --> 00:48:25,599
He understood that it must be a leather patch.

880
00:48:27,647 --> 00:48:33,535
Somewhere he had read that they paired in the fall and slept through the winter and then the fertilization took place with delayed

881
00:48:33,791 --> 00:48:34.303
Effect in the spring.

882
00:48:35,327 --> 00:48:37,119
Shouldn't they have pulled away for wintering already?

883
00:48:39,167 --> 00:48:40,191
But it had been a warm autumn.

884
00:48:41,215 --> 00:48:43,263
Probably there were still plenty of insects.

885
00:48:44,287 --> 00:48:46,335
The bats could eat many hundreds per night.

886
00:48:48,127 --> 00:48:49,151
He knew they are stained

887
00:48:49,663 --> 00:48:51,199
And that the bite spread severe illnesses.

888
00:48:52,735 --> 00:48:56,319
He lit all the lights and the bat flew restlessly back and forth,

889
00:48:56,831 --> 00:48:59.331
stroked tightly past his face.

890
00:48:59,647 --> 00:49:00.927
It did it time and time again,

891
00:49:01,439 --> 00:49:02.975
avoided him with the help of his radar.

892
00:49:04,255 --> 00:49:06.047
He knew it was screaming all the time

893
00:49:06.303 --> 00:49:09,375
at a frequency almost no human could hear, how musical

894
00:49:09,631 --> 00:49:10,143
She was.

895
00:49:11,423 --> 00:49:13,727
Brander Rös and followed the bat with the gaze and

896
00:49:13,983 --> 00:49:17,068
Saw how it sat high on the wall.

897
00:49:17,311 --> 00:49:21,151
He took the garbage brush and poked on the animal with the shaft

898
00:49:21,151 --> 00:49:25,285
The leather patch was left, dry and grayish brown

899
00:49:25,503 --> 00:49:29,490
And motionless and he considered pressing it with the brush, kill it.

900
00:49:30,111 --> 00:49:32,159
He thought of the blind will to survive-

901
00:49:32,927 --> 00:49:34,207
The one found in all living

902
00:49:35,999 --> 00:49:36,767
and on the bite and on the diseases

903
00:49:36,767 --> 00:49:38,767
And didn't dare.

904
00:49:41,631 --> 00:49:43,167
There we get to know

905
00:49:44,191 --> 00:49:44,959
to

906
00:49:46,239 --> 00:49:48,287
Thomas Brander

907
00:49:53,151 --> 00:49:54,175
has lived a protected life.

908
00:49:55,455 --> 00:49:56,735
He has lived on top.

909
00:49:59,039 --> 00:50:01.855
Yes, they bits and then there will be serious illnesses.

910
00:50:03,391 --> 00:50:06,719
It is something he has read and perceived

911
00:50:07,231 --> 00:50:07,999
but

912
00:50:08,255 --> 00:50:10.303
he has not been confronted

913
00:50:10,815 --> 00:50:15,679
with the big dangers. We also know that the illnesses he is talking about,

914
00:50:16,447 --> 00:50:18,239
We know what disease it is.

915
00:50:18,751 --> 00:50:20.031
It's the pandemic.

916
00:50:20,799 --> 00:50:26,360
Its mythical beginning, its mythical emergence.

917
00:50:27,711 --> 00:50:28,735
So does

918
00:50:28,991 --> 00:50:29.503
That we know

919
00:50:30,271 --> 00:50:32.575
This is a fading memory.

920
00:50:33,343 --> 00:50:34,964
This with the bats

921
00:50:35,391 --> 00:50:36,671
And the diseases

922
00:50:36,671 --> 00:50:38,597
that remains.

923
00:50:38,975 --> 00:50:40,255
The threat remains,

924
00:50:40,767 --> 00:50:42.303
Everything is left

925
00:50:42,559 --> 00:50:44,095
But is now

926
00:50:44,351 --> 00:50:45,887
faded

927
00:50:46,143 --> 00:50:46,911
as memory.

928
00:50:47,423 --> 00:50:50,239
That was exactly what I was looking for.

929
00:50:50,751 --> 00:50:51.519
I think so

930
00:50:51,775 --> 00:50:52,543
is a fantastic,

931
00:50:53,567 --> 00:50:55,615
Brilliant and illustrative

932
00:50:55,871 --> 00:50:56,639
example

933
00:50:57,151 --> 00:50:58,431
On how

934
00:50:58,943 --> 00:51:00.821
you

935
00:51:01,503 --> 00:51:03,356
tells

936
00:51:04,831 --> 00:51:07.647
in a way that makes the people

937
00:51:08,159 --> 00:51:09.695
and your story

938
00:51:09,951 --> 00:51:11,999
retains their secrets.

939
00:51:12,255 --> 00:51:14,559
You don't serve everything at once

940
00:51:14,815 --> 00:51:16,607
Without it, the kitchen path comes in.

941
00:51:17,119 --> 00:51:19,679
It blows in through the window in shape

942
00:51:20,191 --> 00:51:20,703
by a bat.

943
00:51:22,239 --> 00:51:26,335
I think that is one of the reasons for your novels

944
00:51:26,335 --> 00:51:28,335
is permanent.

945
00:51:31,711 --> 00:51:32,479
Now I realize

946
00:51:32,735 --> 00:51:35,295
As I listen to you now I realize that I never answered,

947
00:51:35,551 --> 00:51:37,599
I gave a very indirect

948
00:51:37,855 --> 00:51:41,439
and not entirely detailed answer to your question what it was that was so faustically

949
00:51:41,951 --> 00:51:43,487
Last spring with move

950
00:51:43,999 --> 00:51:49,119
Time in Tritonus to the near future. The faustic was, of course, that while I sat and did it

951
00:51:49,631 --> 00:51:50,911
grew

952
00:51:51,423 --> 00:51:57.567
pandemic and became increasingly ravaged around the world and people became ill and died.

953
00:51:58,079 --> 00:51:58.847
There I sat.

954
00:52:00,127 --> 00:52:02.431
Then I didn't have this work room but I sat

955
00:52:02,943 --> 00:52:04,735
In another part of Helsinki

956
00:52:06,015 --> 00:52:11,135
And wrote this book. I can also think, you do many stuff as a writer,

957
00:52:11,391 --> 00:52:14,207
Or I do many stuff as a writer.

958
00:52:14,463 --> 00:52:15,999
It is the intuition that speaks

959
00:52:16,511 --> 00:52:20,095
Which is often wiser and knows more than even rational self.

960
00:52:20,607 --> 00:52:23,935
I may find it a bit strange that I

961
00:52:24,703 --> 00:52:28,031
In October 2016, this introductory scene wrote

962
00:52:29,311 --> 00:52:32,164
Without knowing that within a few years ...

963
00:52:32,383 --> 00:52:34,687
What was to come!

964
00:52:34,687 --> 00:52:36,479
Just!

965
00:52:36,479 --> 00:52:42,623
Tritonus is a musical term for the dissonant

966
00:52:42,879 --> 00:52:44,671
So -called the devil interval.

967
00:52:47,487 --> 00:52:52.607
Even the name of the sumptuous archipelago villa novel's main character, the star conductor

968
00:52:52,863 --> 00:52:53,887
Thomas Brander

969
00:52:53,887 --> 00:52:57,215
lets build far out in the archipelago, where we were just,

970
00:52:57,471 --> 00:53:01.311
In the interior scene you read.

971
00:53:01,542 --> 00:53:05.663
Gothenburg Post's critic Mikaela Blomqvist writes something

972
00:53:06,431 --> 00:53:08,735
Which I really like the building.

973
00:53:10,015 --> 00:53:11,295
Casa Tritonus,

974
00:53:11,807 --> 00:53:12,831
as he baptizes it to,

975
00:53:14,111 --> 00:53:18,719
appears as a monument to the conductor's loneliness rather than his work.

976
00:53:19,231 --> 00:53:20,511
Tasteless, boastful, empty.

977
00:53:22,047 --> 00:53:23,839
Well strict and harsh words,

978
00:53:24,095 --> 00:53:25,375
I mean enough

979
00:53:25,631 --> 00:53:26,911
that Tomas Brander

980
00:53:27,167 --> 00:53:28,703
also

981
00:53:29,471 --> 00:53:31,519
is one

982
00:53:32,799 --> 00:53:38.431
complex and contradictory man with qualities that make him

983
00:53:39,455 --> 00:53:39.967
host

984
00:53:40,991 --> 00:53:42,271
get to know.

985
00:53:43,039 --> 00:53:44.063
I mean that too.

986
00:53:48,927 --> 00:53:54.047
What was it that made you choose to place your story about the sore but gryended friendship between

987
00:53:54,303 --> 00:53:56.607
him, the famous artist

988
00:53:56,863 --> 00:53:59,679
At the beginning of their downhill in career

989
00:53:59,935 --> 00:54:00.959
And his neighbor

990
00:54:01,215 --> 00:54:04.031
the curator, the contradictory

991
00:54:04,543 --> 00:54:05.311
the curator

992
00:54:05,567 --> 00:54:09.663
Reidar Lindell, Local Hero and also musicians

993
00:54:09,663 --> 00:54:10,943
stuck in a dull

994
00:54:11,199 --> 00:54:12,735
cover bands in the archipelago,

995
00:54:12,991 --> 00:54:14,527
named Rainbow.

996
00:54:16,575 --> 00:54:19,135
That thus exists in reality?

997
00:54:19,903 --> 00:54:21,439
The band Rainbow?

998
00:54:21,695 --> 00:54:23,231
Yes!

999
00:54:23,487 --> 00:54:25.535
There was a band called Rainbow that was

1000
00:54:25,791 --> 00:54:31,935
FD Deep Purple guitarist Ritchie Blackmore's band.

1001
00:54:32,191 --> 00:54:38,335
I play in two cover bands myself but they are not called Rainbow. I have not chosen my own

1002
00:54:38,591 --> 00:54:43,455
Coverband's repertoire for Rainbow but rather tried to give Rainbow

1003
00:54:43,711 --> 00:54:44,991
A little Mishmashig repertoire.

1004
00:54:46,527 --> 00:54:48,831
Okay, they have.

1005
00:54:49,599 --> 00:54:52,927
This by placing

1006
00:54:53,695 --> 00:54:55.231
The story out in

1007
00:54:55,999 --> 00:54:57.791
I understand,

1008
00:54:58,047 --> 00:54:59,839
postpandemically, people have moved

1009
00:55:00,095 --> 00:55:00.863
The cities.

1010
00:55:01,119 --> 00:55:05,983
And that movement out of cities

1011
00:55:07,007 --> 00:55:07,775
And the cures.

1012
00:55:08,287 --> 00:55:09.311
But

1013
00:55:11,359 --> 00:55:15,711
There must be another reason too? Where you are tired of Helsinki?

1014
00:55:16,479 --> 00:55:21,343
No, I'm not tired of Helsinki but we should remember, we are on the right track here so to

1015
00:55:21,599 --> 00:55:24,671
The idea and novel construction started even before the pandemic.

1016
00:55:25,439 --> 00:55:31,071
Then it has actually happened, there is an escape, most recently today I saw a heading in a newspaper,

1017
00:55:31,327 --> 00:55:34,911
If relocation from all Nordic capitals

1018
00:55:35,679 --> 00:55:39,263
All Nordic capitals lose the number of inhabitants.

1019
00:55:41,823 --> 00:55:44,383
But this I didn't know when I started

1020
00:55:45,151 --> 00:55:45,919
Write the novel

1021
00:55:46,431 --> 00:55:48,735
2016, without it was

1022
00:55:48,991 --> 00:55:50,271
a personal

1023
00:55:50,527 --> 00:55:52,319
Prolonged dream it was about.

1024
00:55:53,087 --> 00:55:54,879
The environment in the world that

1025
00:55:55,391 --> 00:55:56,927
I think I feel

1026
00:55:57,695 --> 00:55:58,719
Very strong

1027
00:55:58,975 --> 00:55:59.487
for,

1028
00:55:59,743 --> 00:56:01.023
Further to Helsinki,

1029
00:56:01,791 --> 00:56:03,839
is the southern Finnish archipelago.

1030
00:56:04,607 --> 00:56:10,751
I have been lucky enough to spend not only spent summers but also autumn and spring in the archipelago ever since 1988,

1031
00:56:11,007 --> 00:56:12.543
for almost 33 years.

1032
00:56:13,311 --> 00:56:14,591
First i had over 20 years

1033
00:56:14,847 --> 00:56:17,151
a cabin on an island

1034
00:56:17,663 --> 00:56:18,175
and then

1035
00:56:18,687 --> 00:56:19,711
I divorced and

1036
00:56:19,967 --> 00:56:22.527
Everything must be rebuilt. Now i have had in

1037
00:56:23,039 --> 00:56:25,343
Five to six years, cottage on another island.

1038
00:56:25,599 --> 00:56:28,671
So I dreamed for many years about writing an archipelago novel.

1039
00:56:30,463 --> 00:56:31,487
To place a novel this

1040
00:56:31,999 --> 00:56:32,511
small

1041
00:56:33,023 --> 00:56:34.303
maybe in a way more

1042
00:56:35,071 --> 00:56:38,911
easy -to -handle community where things become very clear

1043
00:56:39,423 --> 00:56:41,471
Compared to the diversity and complexity of the big city.

1044
00:56:42,751 --> 00:56:44,287
So it's an old

1045
00:56:45,055 --> 00:56:46,079
personal

1046
00:56:46,591 --> 00:56:47,615
Author dream I have

1047
00:56:47,871 --> 00:56:50,725
realized when I have placed “Tritonus” in

1048
00:56:50,943 --> 00:56:54,783
The archipelago instead of in Helsinki. Helsinki is there

1049
00:56:55,039 --> 00:56:56,575
in Branders and others' memory.

1050
00:56:59,135 --> 00:57:01,183
Both Brander and Lindell were born and raised in Helsinki but

1051
00:57:01,695 --> 00:57:05,279
Helsingborg certainly plays a minor role this time. But I'm not tired of town

1052
00:57:05,535 --> 00:57:10,911
and the novel I have now started and hope to complete in a few years

1053
00:57:11,423 --> 00:57:12,959
it is settled again in

1054
00:57:13,215 --> 00:57:14,239
A historic Helsinki.

1055
00:57:15,263 --> 00:57:19,871
I thought we would end now. It begins to suffer towards its end.

1056
00:57:21,407 --> 00:57:21,919
I would

1057
00:57:22,175 --> 00:57:28,954
Like to get you to tell you a little more about this new novel project

1058
00:57:30,111 --> 00:57:32,159
Which I think sounds so interesting.

1059
00:57:32,927 --> 00:57:35,743
As I understand that so

1060
00:57:35,999 --> 00:57:37,791
the time room

1061
00:57:38.303 --> 00:57:40,863
from mid -March 1940

1062
00:57:41,119 --> 00:57:45,850
until midsummer 1941 when the continuation war starts.

1063
00:57:46,239 --> 00:57:49.567
What is well called in Finnish history.

1064
00:57:49,823 --> 00:57:52,383
It is called the intermediate peace in Finnish history writing, yes.

1065
00:57:52,895 --> 00:57:53,919
A very fragile

1066
00:57:54,175 --> 00:57:54,687
such.

1067
00:57:54,943 --> 00:57:58,527
Maybe the story comes, now I'm right in the beginning so I can't

1068
00:57:58,783 --> 00:58:01.087
say something confident. I can not either

1069
00:58:01,343 --> 00:58:03.903
say too much, because there comes the writer's crash,

1070
00:58:04,159 --> 00:58:07,999
The author's skepings in. If I talk to the book I will not be able to

1071
00:58:08,767 --> 00:58:10.047
Write it. But

1072
00:58:10,303 --> 00:58:15,935
Just this time axis, possibly I continue a bit into the continuing war, maybe this fall

1073
00:58:16,447 --> 00:58:17,215
1941.

1074
00:58:20,287 --> 00:58:24,895
I have avoided wars ,, as I already said in my novels for

1075
00:58:25,663 --> 00:58:27,967
that grandfather and grandfather died there and it has been so

1076
00:58:28,479 --> 00:58:30,271
loaded in my family. But now the year then

1077
00:58:30,783 --> 00:58:33,343
I turn 60 so I feel ready.

1078
00:58:33,855 --> 00:58:37.951
But I go a bit a detour because I write about this one

1079
00:58:38,463 --> 00:58:40,511
fragile, remarkable period of

1080
00:58:41,023 --> 00:58:46,143
some kind of peace or ceasefire with the Soviet Union we had between March 40

1081
00:58:46,655 --> 00:58:47,423
and

1082
00:58:47,935 --> 00:58:50,751
midsummer 1941. At the same time as

1083
00:58:51,007 --> 00:58:52,799
World War continued

1084
00:58:53,311 --> 00:58:55,591
not just unabated without

1085
00:58:55,871 --> 00:58:57,407
exacerbated force

1086
00:58:57,407 --> 00:58:58,431
around us.

1087
00:58:59,967 --> 00:59:03,039
This spring 1940 when Finland is trying to stumble

1088
00:59:03,807 --> 00:59:06.367
Get back on feet after the winter war

1089
00:59:07,647 --> 00:59:08.927
Takes Germany first

1090
00:59:09,183 --> 00:59:09.951
Denmark

1091
00:59:10,463 --> 00:59:11,487
since Norway,

1092
00:59:11,999 --> 00:59:13,791
since Belgium, since the Netherlands,

1093
00:59:14,303 --> 00:59:15,839
Since June France.

1094
00:59:16,351 --> 00:59:18,399
The Soviet Union enters the Baltic.

1095
00:59:18,655 --> 00:59:19,423
It is

1096
00:59:19,935 --> 00:59:21,215
a terrible time

1097
00:59:22,239 --> 00:59:23,007
and

1098
00:59:24,031 --> 00:59:24,543
I have

1099
00:59:25,311 --> 00:59:29,151
long been fascinated by that time just in Finland when we had a kind of peace

1100
00:59:31,455 --> 00:59:33,503
27,000 men had already died

1101
00:59:34,271 --> 00:59:39,135
When to do agricultural work in the summer of 1940, there were like gaps everywhere.

1102
00:59:39,647 --> 00:59:40,671
It needed more

1103
00:59:40,927 --> 00:59:42,975
Finnish .... than ever for

1104
00:59:43,743 --> 00:59:45,279
on many farms

1105
00:59:45,535 --> 00:59:48,351
The sons have not come home. It is a very strange time

1106
00:59:49,119 --> 00:59:53,471
I want to try to portray it as I usually do through

1107
00:59:53,471 --> 00:59:57,775
Apparently quite everyday people and their fate.

1108
01:00:01,407 --> 01:00:03,199
My wife and i

1109
01:00:03,711 --> 01:00:04,479
spent,

1110
01:00:06,271 --> 01:00:09,599
were in the countryside, in the house on the countryside

1111
01:00:09,855 --> 01:00:12,159
from the end of March to

1112
01:00:13,951 --> 01:00:16,767
A week, ten days into August, almost all the time.

1113
01:00:18,815 --> 01:00:20,095
For quarantine reasons.

1114
01:00:23,935 --> 01:00:27,263
Every now and then we had to go into town.

1115
01:00:28,799 --> 01:00:32,639
It was an extremely peculiar experience.

1116
01:00:33,151 --> 01:00:34,175
The whole town,

1117
01:00:34,943 --> 01:00:36,735
What one associates with town,

1118
01:00:36,991 --> 01:00:38,527
life, movement,

1119
01:00:38,783 --> 01:00:40.063
cafes,

1120
01:00:40,319 --> 01:00:41,599
Where was out of play.

1121
01:00:43,647 --> 01:00:45,183
In Sweden it was light, after all,

1122
01:00:45,439 --> 01:00:51,583
compared to somewhere else. But

1123
01:00:52,095 --> 01:00:53,887
Yet it was this one

1124
01:00:54,399 --> 01:00:56.703
silence, this silent spring

1125
01:00:56,959 --> 01:00:57,983
where town was like

1126
01:00:58,495 --> 01:01:03.103
an architect model under a plastic cup

1127
01:01:03,359 --> 01:01:05.407
with people placed

1128
01:01:05,663 --> 01:01:06.431
like this.

1129
01:01:11,039 --> 01:01:16,159
That feeling, I understand when you in your correspondence with itkoinen,

1130
01:01:18,207 --> 01:01:20,767
that feeling becomes somehow

1131
01:01:21,023 --> 01:01:24,095
a resonance box or sound base

1132
01:01:24,351 --> 01:01:26,655
for this new novel there

1133
01:01:26,911 --> 01:01:28,447
Helsinki is

1134
01:01:28,703 --> 01:01:29,471
trapped,

1135
01:01:29,727 --> 01:01:31,007
cut off,

1136
01:01:31,519 --> 01:01:33,604
silent.

1137
01:01:33,823 --> 01:01:39,455
In the letter I wrote you to Itkoinen I describe a beautiful but icy April evening

1138
01:01:39,711 --> 01:01:40,223
Last year.

1139
01:01:40,479 --> 01:01:43,551
We then had a very strict Lockdown

1140
01:01:43,807 --> 01:01:45.087
in Helsinki.

1141
01:01:45,599 --> 01:01:49,183
So I live on Skatudden which is a very centrally located

1142
01:01:49,695 --> 01:01:51,743
neighborhood

1143
01:01:51,999 --> 01:01:53,279
right next to Helsinki,

1144
01:01:54,047 --> 01:01:55,583
At the heart of Helsinki City.

1145
01:01:57,119 --> 01:01:59,167
I went, this cold

1146
01:01:59,423 --> 01:02:01.727
But sunny April night I went in

1147
01:02:02,239 --> 01:02:07.871
to the center and walked along the Esplanad Park and Alexandersgatan and I have to say that as

1148
01:02:08,127 --> 01:02:14,271
native Helsinki and a man who was still in love with his hometown, I was close

1149
01:02:14,527 --> 01:02:15.039
to start crying.

1150
01:02:16,831 --> 01:02:17,855
It was dead.

1151
01:02:17,855 --> 01:02:19,855
It was like after one,

1152
01:02:20,000 --> 01:02:28,095
When in our youth you talked about the fear of hydrogen bomb, the bomb that would remove all people but leave the buildings intact.

1153
01:02:28,095 --> 01:02:30,143
That's what it looked like.

1154
01:02:30,655 --> 01:02:36,799
Then I pulled the parallel, because I was sitting at the Finnish National Library at the time

1155
01:02:37,311 --> 01:02:38,591
and read about the Second World War

1156
01:02:39,871 --> 01:02:42,175
that this is a tough time and it's terribly heavy,

1157
01:02:42,943 --> 01:02:47,295
But think that from 1939 to 1945, for six years

1158
01:02:48,063 --> 01:02:50,623
had people in most European countries

1159
01:02:50,879 --> 01:02:52,159
No normal everyday life.

1160
01:02:52,671 --> 01:02:54,463
Nothing was normal in six years.

1161
01:02:59,839 --> 01:03:02.399
You said initially when we

1162
01:03:03,423 --> 01:03:04.959
Talked us together

1163
01:03:04,959 --> 01:03:08.910
before the broadcast

1164
01:03:08,910 --> 01:03:10,910
Did you say that

1165
01:03:10,910 --> 01:03:18,471
You sat there with notes with notes and that it goes terribly sluggish ...

1166
01:03:18,471 --> 01:03:19,039
Is there any single

1167
01:03:19,039 --> 01:03:20,063
sentence

1168
01:03:20,319 --> 01:03:23,647
from any one of these pieces of paper

1169
01:03:23,903 --> 01:03:24,927
as you could

1170
01:03:25,439 --> 01:03:26,463
Drown you

1171
01:03:27,743 --> 01:03:28,767
To read up?

1172
01:03:29,023 --> 01:03:31,071
In order to in that case we would be

1173
01:03:31,583 --> 01:03:35,423
First in the world! Don't you dare?

1174
01:03:35,423 --> 01:03:41,567
I have inside the machine some, but I dare not, no! There goes the limit for this author's procedure!

1175
01:03:41,823 --> 01:03:43,615
If I do, it's run!

1176
01:03:43,871 --> 01:03:47,199
Okay!

1177
01:03:47,967 --> 01:03:48,479
You will have

1178
01:03:48,735 --> 01:03:49.503
many thanks!

1179
01:03:50,271 --> 01:03:51.807
You also!

1180
01:03:52,575 --> 01:03:58,463
So you should also know that I have been to Lahti, I have been elsewhere in Finland, but I have never been to Helsinki.

1181
01:03:59,231 --> 01:04:01.791
But since I read everything you write

1182
01:04:02.047 --> 01:04:04.095
So I don't think I need it either!

1183
01:04:04,607 --> 01:04:06.655
I've been there so many times

1184
01:04:07,167 --> 01:04:09.215
And in so many different eras.

1185
01:04:09,471 --> 01:04:11,263
But I shall remedy

1186
01:04:11,519 --> 01:04:13,311
This gap in my formation.

1187
01:04:14,079 --> 01:04:16,895
If you come over, I offer a glass!

1188
01:04:18,175 --> 01:04:18,943
I hope so!

1189
01:04:20,991 --> 01:04:21,759
Have a good Kjell!

1190
01:04:23,295 --> 01:04:23,807
Bye!

1191
01:04:24,319 --> 01:04:24,831
Hello!
