1
00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:55.560
It was fun to play badminton.
 You threw yourself after each ball!

2
00:00:55.720 --> 00:01:00.840
I fell.
 The substrate is so silent.

3
00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:04.640
Try real shoes.

4
00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:11.560
The Chinese are the best in badminton, and they use sock plastic.

5
00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:18.080
-Are you sure about that?
 - Or if it was the gymnastics team ...

6
00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:23.720
-Do you want water?
 - I've been drinking three liters ...

7
00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:31.320
But a sandwich would be nice!
 With the new soft cheese - shrimp, bacon and salami.

8
00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:36.560
It received nice reviews:

9
00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:42.760
- "A perfect cheese symphony."
 - Yes, I can try a little.

10
00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:53.080
Now a series about the inland ice begins.

11
00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:59.280
The report is made by a group of Danish researchers.

12
00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:05.480
It took them eight years to compile the material ...

13
00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:16.160
- It's second on all channels.
 - What is it wrong with the second?

14
00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:22.840
- They have both series and debates.
 - You can get in 20s.

15
00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:29.640
You sound just like Lena.
 Set all the channels if you can!

16
00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:34.240
Not needed.
 They are preset.

17
00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:42.600
Our host is Thorsten Flinck.

18
00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:48.600
Göran ... thanks!
 I had made our way to us.

19
00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:53.200
But I think you should have both.

20
00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:59.000
- I am not so hungry ... —do yourself!

21
00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:06.440
- Do you look over on the cake tomorrow?
 -Yes.

22
00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:12.240
First, I wake her up in the morning.

23
00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:16.680
Annika doesn't know so many here.

24
00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:23.720
There is not much to feel.
 Most live superficial, empty lives.

25
00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:27.320
Check out - cartoon!

26
00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:34.920
- They drive drawn 24 hours a day.
 - How to be able to stay awake?

27
00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:44.280
- Did you get any gift?
 - I have built a loom.

28
00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:51.880
At the construction show they showed an English variant.
 She looked at it for hours.

29
00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:59.480
- I have tried to build a similar one.
 - You are happy that you are not handy!

30
00:03:59.640 --> 00:04:07.080
I'll pick it up now.
 I mount it in the living room tonight ...

31
00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:14.920
- Serve if you want carrying help.
 - Yes, it's heavy ...

32
00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:21.680
When you offer to help, it means nothing.

33
00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:27.560
It's a phrase that spreads nice atmosphere ...

34
00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:30.560
See you!

35
00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:36.360
Is it certain that they show signed around the clock?

36
00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:41.960
-Certainly.
 - And so they say the world is evil!

37
00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:55.640
Gustav looks at the cartoon and laughs

38
00:05:11.400 --> 00:05:18.840
- Gustav, stop!
 It's half past twelve!
 - Yes ... Now comes the wicked cat!

39
00:05:23.400 --> 00:05:27.840
There he got it!
 Right down for the cliff!

40
00:05:31.240 --> 00:05:38.480
My God ... Say what you want about the Jänkarna ... draw, they can!

41
00:05:38.640 --> 00:05:45.680
I am impressed.
 Few adults can watch such crap for five hours.

42
00:05:45.840 --> 00:05:51.280
It is fun.
 And then you have to learn new things.

43
00:05:51.440 --> 00:05:59.080
- Cousin has a circus.
 - He had to sell it ...

44
00:05:59.240 --> 00:06:03.200
I'm not interested!

45
00:06:03.360 --> 00:06:10.000
- Will Göran and Annika come tomorrow?
 -Yes.
 They come half past eleven.

46
00:06:10.160 --> 00:06:13.800
Did you buy a gift?

47
00:06:13.960 --> 00:06:19.280
No, we have the whole basement full of stuff.

48
00:06:19.440 --> 00:06:26.080
- I got a nice thing from them.
 - You have not moved the kit ...

49
00:06:26.240 --> 00:06:32.160
- The description was incomprehensible.
 - It was in English.

50
00:06:32.320 --> 00:06:39.280
- Did you know what she gets from Göran?
 - The fool has built a loom.

51
00:06:39.440 --> 00:06:46.880
It is really pretty!
 Imagine putting so much work down on the one you love.

52
00:06:47.040 --> 00:06:52.240
The important thing is what it is for a gift.

53
00:06:54.480 --> 00:07:02.400
- A wife should get something romantic!
 - Yes, what was I getting from you ...

54
00:07:02.560 --> 00:07:10.000
Now we talk about Göran and Annika!
 In addition, we needed new winter tires.

55
00:07:11.160 --> 00:07:18.800
Every time she sees the loom, she is reminded of how much he loves her.

56
00:07:18.960 --> 00:07:24.560
When you take a curve without the gossip, you think of me.

57
00:07:24.720 --> 00:07:32.360
It is that thought that exists before taking each other for given ...

58
00:07:32.520 --> 00:07:39.000
I am equally surprised every morning that you remain.

59
00:07:39.160 --> 00:07:45.400
- Where would I be then?
 -What do I know?
 In the kitchen maybe.

60
00:07:45.560 --> 00:07:53.000
I wake you so you can arrange everything.
 I'll listen when you work.

61
00:07:57.280 --> 00:08:01.720
Well ... have you been to Liseberg?

62
00:08:01.880 --> 00:08:05.320
Been run out?

63
00:08:05.480 --> 00:08:13.120
You wanted to see how fast the carousel could go?
 What did the class manager say?

64
00:08:13.280 --> 00:08:17.920
He thought it went slowly?
 Well ...

65
00:08:19.280 --> 00:08:26.720
Here is as usual.
 Annika is celebrating years, so we will celebrate her.
 Yes, I greet.

66
00:08:26.880 --> 00:08:32.480
- Puzzlepuss ... - was it max?
 Does he have fun?

67
00:08:32.640 --> 00:08:40.320
Think so.
 They have been driven out from Liseberg and are going to police interrogation.

68
00:08:40.480 --> 00:08:46.920
- And you pay for that!
 - He borrowed money from you.

69
00:08:47.080 --> 00:08:54.520
- Till very favorable interest rates!
 Look.
 - Oh ... that perfume is great.

70
00:08:54.680 --> 00:09:01.720
- This is almost too much.
 - But it's more fun than the loom.

71
00:09:01.880 --> 00:09:10.160
- It is very funny by Göran.
 - Well, you didn't say about the doll cabinet.

72
00:09:10.320 --> 00:09:16.760
I do not call two glued plot slopes a dollhouse.

73
00:09:16.920 --> 00:09:22.360
Playing is about using your imagination.

74
00:09:22.520 --> 00:09:28.360
My favorite toy was a regular little pine cone.

75
00:09:28.520 --> 00:09:35.360
In the imagination I turned it into a stone, a spruce cone ...

76
00:09:35.520 --> 00:09:42.160
Very interesting, Gustav, but now they come.
 Everyone in place!

77
00:09:44.880 --> 00:09:50.120
No, Gustav, not now!
 - Yes!

78
00:09:50.280 --> 00:09:53.760
Happy birthday to you...

79
00:09:55.320 --> 00:10:01.400
- Where's the birthday child?
 - It's probably just me.

80
00:10:01.560 --> 00:10:07.800
- Do you decorate that I am unruly?
 -Why are you asking that?

81
00:10:07.960 --> 00:10:12.400
I am "romantic as a firewood".

82
00:10:12.560 --> 00:10:16.400
It was good to take in ... a little.

83
00:10:16.560 --> 00:10:21.000
All the gifts I gave her was wrong.

84
00:10:22.560 --> 00:10:29.160
For three months I have talked about the necklace.
 And get a loom!

85
00:10:29.320 --> 00:10:36.880
- You stood at the fair and looked at it.
 - What would I look like?
 Planes ???

86
00:10:37.040 --> 00:10:43.880
I'm tired of planks and nails and building fairs!
 It's boring!

87
00:10:45.800 --> 00:10:48.600
Congratulations...

88
00:10:48.760 --> 00:10:55.680
The heating loops that you intend to pull into the bathroom ... Forget them!

89
00:10:57.840 --> 00:11:00.320
Göran ...

90
00:11:00.480 --> 00:11:07.720
- Take these and run her.
 - We probably have a bottle of wine too.

91
00:11:07.880 --> 00:11:14.560
- Doesn't it do with the flowers?
 -Stop it!
 Göran is sorry!

92
00:11:14.720 --> 00:11:20.160
- Are you, Göran?
 - Yes, a little, actually.

93
00:11:20.320 --> 00:11:26.880
- The wine is quite expensive ... - pick it up!
 - Run after her.

94
00:11:27.040 --> 00:11:31.680
Say how much you like her.

95
00:11:31.840 --> 00:11:39.800
- You might be able to repay this ... - just own!
 Anytime.

96
00:11:39.960 --> 00:11:44.240
Heat loops sound exciting ...

97
00:11:44.400 --> 00:11:48.480
Go now ... Health from us.

98
00:11:48.640 --> 00:11:56.560
Yes, what was it you said?
 When she sees the loom, she feels loved ...

99
00:11:56.720 --> 00:12:03.360
Take a look at yourself!
 How romantic are you really?

100
00:12:03.520 --> 00:12:09.600
I'm very romantic!
 Go ahead darling.

101
00:12:11.760 --> 00:12:17.960
- Why do you give me the perfume?
 -I love you.

102
00:12:19.120 --> 00:12:26.560
- You had bought it for Annika.
 - It was among unproved packages.

103
00:12:28.720 --> 00:12:32.360
Now the cat comes again!

104
00:12:36.200 --> 00:12:43.800
- How is it with Göran and Annika?
 - Annika and mom are out and about.

105
00:12:43.960 --> 00:12:51.600
- I have never seen her so angry.
 - You know little about their fellow human beings.

106
00:12:51.760 --> 00:12:58.200
They have only been married for a year and should be happy.

107
00:12:58.360 --> 00:13:05.440
- But they live in a nightmare.
 - Dad, they have never struggled before.

108
00:13:05.600 --> 00:13:13.040
- It should be a little up and down.
 - Help have it calm and nice even!

109
00:13:13.200 --> 00:13:20.840
It applies to everything.
 "The road to death is long. Why not travel comfortably?"

110
00:13:23.400 --> 00:13:27.840
Oh my God!
 Andy Panda has started!

111
00:13:29.600 --> 00:13:35.320
The bank does not lend so much money anyway.

112
00:13:35.480 --> 00:13:43.480
I would start one in Uddevalla, but then Göran got a job here.

113
00:13:43.640 --> 00:13:48.480
-What are you talking about?
 - Annika wants to open a cafe.

114
00:13:48.640 --> 00:13:56.280
Good idea, huh?
 Here is theater, museum - boring places that no one goes on!

115
00:13:56.440 --> 00:14:02.360
- A cafe is needed.
 - Yes, where you can be seen after school.

116
00:14:02.520 --> 00:14:07.960
There you hear!
 It's about time that I chance a little.

117
00:14:08.120 --> 00:14:14.760
The bank may not feel that way.
 There is a lot to lock.

118
00:14:14.920 --> 00:14:20.560
You have to have a guarantor who is known on the bank ...

119
00:14:20.720 --> 00:14:24.560
It is already clear.
 Look!

120
00:14:24.720 --> 00:14:28.960
- Gustav Svensson?
 -Yes.

121
00:14:29.120 --> 00:14:37.160
- Why does your name stand on the paper?
 - The investment is idiot safe!

122
00:14:37.320 --> 00:14:44.520
- So you said about the pyramid game too ... - you have to dare to win!

123
00:14:44.680 --> 00:14:50.520
- It as never ... - connect with the clichés now, Gustav!

124
00:14:50.680 --> 00:14:56.320
Make a budget and formulate a business idea -

125
00:14:56.480 --> 00:15:00.160
- So I talk to the bank.

126
00:15:00.320 --> 00:15:05.560
Good cookies, freshly baked buns, good coffee!

127
00:15:05.720 --> 00:15:11.480
Does not work there is no justice in the world!

128
00:15:23.440 --> 00:15:31.240
No, the dark cookies were better.
 Try to have more almond paste in the dough.

129
00:15:31.400 --> 00:15:38.400
- Isn't it too sweet then?
 - No cake can ever be too sweet.

130
00:15:39.560 --> 00:15:45.680
- How many tables?
 - Eight - and you take coffee bread yourself.

131
00:15:45.840 --> 00:15:50.400
Great!
 No thick glass top for.

132
00:15:50.560 --> 00:15:58.680
Now the paper is ready.
 Have you told Göran that you have mortgaged the house?

133
00:15:58.840 --> 00:16:02.760
They can take the house away from you ...

134
00:16:02.920 --> 00:16:06.800
Göran can build a new one.

135
00:16:06.960 --> 00:16:14.240
- Have you come up with a good name?
 -Yes.
 It should be called Annika's cafe.

136
00:16:14.400 --> 00:16:23.200
- It took a while to figure out ... - well!
 You are Annika and have a cafe.

137
00:16:23.360 --> 00:16:28.520
-Just!
 - Two sharp brains in sweet compound.

138
00:16:28.680 --> 00:16:34.400
- What does Göran say?
 - I haven't talked to him.

139
00:16:34.560 --> 00:16:41.600
- Don't be angry.
 He is sad.
 - He should be happy who can build it!

140
00:16:41.760 --> 00:16:48.280
–Wa?
 You didn't want his help.
 - He does it for free.

141
00:16:51.440 --> 00:16:57.080
- Annika ... - do you not have a cafe to build?

142
00:16:57.240 --> 00:17:05.040
- I was just thinking of showing the color samples.
 - Look at the curtains, I've said!

143
00:17:05.200 --> 00:17:10.240
Okay.
 Then I start to paint tonight.
 Hello.

144
00:17:16.400 --> 00:17:22.240
- I'll be coming soon.
 - The chairs should look like in Sköna home.

145
00:17:22.400 --> 00:17:27.440
-Wait!
 Have you tried these?
 -No.

146
00:17:27.600 --> 00:17:34.120
Sin.
 They are really successful.
 A little stingy with jam, maybe.

147
00:17:34.280 --> 00:17:37.920
Göran, sit down ...

148
00:17:39.440 --> 00:17:46.680
I know it can be tricky ... I'll tell you a story.

149
00:17:46.840 --> 00:17:53.280
A postman married a nice girl from Örebro.

150
00:17:53.440 --> 00:18:00.640
- He was stately and strong ... - I think I understand.
 Continue.

151
00:18:00.800 --> 00:18:05.440
Anyway ... One day she got enough.

152
00:18:05.600 --> 00:18:13.200
She wanted to go out and try something new, something bigger.
 Experience a new universe.

153
00:18:13.360 --> 00:18:18.000
- You mean Vivalla Savings Bank?
 -Just.

154
00:18:18.160 --> 00:18:24.600
- It was the best thing that could happen.
 - She got a new life?

155
00:18:24.760 --> 00:18:31.640
No.
 They got 14,500 more a month!
 The postman bought a ping pong table ...

156
00:18:31.800 --> 00:18:38.040
It's not about money.
 Annika is tired of me.

157
00:18:38.200 --> 00:18:45.960
- Do you find that I'm boring?
 - You have many positive qualities.

158
00:18:46.120 --> 00:18:50.920
- Yeah.
 Like what?
 - You are shooting.

159
00:18:51.080 --> 00:18:56.920
You built a hut for the kids.
 You are kind!

160
00:18:57.080 --> 00:19:04.040
- Sick ... what to do with it?
 - Göran, listen to me ...

161
00:19:04.200 --> 00:19:08.960
Kind is the finest anyone can be.

162
00:19:09.120 --> 00:19:13.800
Annika knows it too.

163
00:19:13.960 --> 00:19:19.200
That's why she stops, though you are so boring.

164
00:19:19.360 --> 00:19:25.200
You are right, you should do what you are best at.

165
00:19:25.360 --> 00:19:29.200
-Where are you going?
 - build the cafe.

166
00:19:29.360 --> 00:19:35.200
-Let me know if you need help.
 - Cement mixer ...

167
00:19:35.360 --> 00:19:42.200
That is a courtesy phrase.
 But I'll make an exception.

168
00:19:42.360 --> 00:19:46.200
But we eat these first.

169
00:19:49.400 --> 00:19:53.640
The inauguration has already begun.

170
00:19:53.800 --> 00:19:58.000
Where is Lina?
 - Lina, we're going!

171
00:19:58.160 --> 00:20:04.760
She is down with Annika at the cafe.
 You drove her there.

172
00:20:04.920 --> 00:20:11.640
- Have you forgotten it?
 - Yes, there was some in the back seat.

173
00:20:11.800 --> 00:20:16.320
He has had a lot, Göran.

174
00:20:16.480 --> 00:20:21.400
He got help!
 I was there for a whole night.

175
00:20:21.560 --> 00:20:26.400
- You fell asleep.
 - I took me a bit again.

176
00:20:26.560 --> 00:20:31.000
You slept under the cement mixer.

177
00:20:31.160 --> 00:20:36.760
It was a feat, as it rattled!

178
00:20:39.400 --> 00:20:43.480
Hello.
 Aren't you in the cafe?

179
00:20:43.640 --> 00:20:50.480
- I just wanted to ask you to bring these.
 - You actually have to wear yourself!

180
00:20:50.640 --> 00:20:58.160
I'm not going.
 Greet that I am happy with the years I got with her.

181
00:20:58.320 --> 00:21:04.880
I stick to Borås.
 I'll stay with my parents.

182
00:21:05.040 --> 00:21:09.480
Borås - Sweden's most boring city!

183
00:21:09.640 --> 00:21:16.480
If I moved every time I was angry - then I would have lived everywhere!

184
00:21:16.640 --> 00:21:24.720
It is so to be married.
 You fight, become the same, watch the sport ...

185
00:21:24.880 --> 00:21:30.400
You don't understand.
 We have never quarreled like this.

186
00:21:30.560 --> 00:21:34.200
It is best to be separated.

187
00:21:34.360 --> 00:21:40.000
You should not stick to something that does not work.

188
00:21:40.160 --> 00:21:46.000
Honey, are you here?
 People await it at the cafe.

189
00:21:46.160 --> 00:21:50.760
- Release them then.
 - Not without you!

190
00:21:50.920 --> 00:21:57.760
How nice you have done.
 Good idea with clothes hangers at each table!

191
00:21:57.920 --> 00:22:01.560
These are to you.

192
00:22:01.720 --> 00:22:07.600
You can have them on the counter.
 On page 53 in comfortable home ...

193
00:22:11.600 --> 00:22:15.440
-Are you done now?
 -Certainly.

194
00:22:17.520 --> 00:22:25.240
I'll just pick up the gift.
 It is a cyclop that no one has picked up.

195
00:22:37.360 --> 00:22:43.320
I don't understand ... one divorce, the next day party.

196
00:22:43.480 --> 00:22:47.840
They hug and laugh and eat ...

197
00:22:48.000 --> 00:22:52.360
And eat ... Lena, give me the binoculars.

198
00:22:52.520 --> 00:22:58.360
Let them be in peace, Gustav.
 Come to lie down now.

199
00:23:00.200 --> 00:23:07.560
- It was useful for Annika.
 –They sees marriage is not so fun

200
00:23:07.720 --> 00:23:14.360
- I don't talk about our marriage.
 - We have had our dusts.

201
00:23:14.520 --> 00:23:21.440
- Are you our first big quarrel?
 - When the baptismal dress became a hammock?

202
00:23:21.600 --> 00:23:27.440
- Over the honeymoon.
 - We could not afford to go abroad!

203
00:23:27.600 --> 00:23:32.040
Södertälje is beautiful in the fall.

204
00:23:33.960 --> 00:23:39.600
- Sin with the cafe ... - They start tearing on Monday.

205
00:23:39.760 --> 00:23:47.120
That she did not suspect anything when the other premises were empty ...

206
00:23:47.280 --> 00:23:54.920
And you should have seen a difference between demolition contracts and leases.

207
00:23:55.080 --> 00:23:58.720
I didn't!

208
00:23:58.880 --> 00:24:05.840
I'm not worried at all.
 Café in Vivalla can't fail!

209
00:24:06.000 --> 00:24:12.440
- You got Göran to go to the castle ...?
 -Just.
 He went on it.

210
00:24:12.600 --> 00:24:19.600
- Dad, I want to go to bed.
 - Sell the room on the left ...

211
00:24:19.760 --> 00:24:25.600
- There is something in the way.
 -Silent!
 It's a gift for mom.

212
00:24:25.760 --> 00:24:29.200
What is it?

213
00:24:29.360 --> 00:24:32.800
A loom.

214
00:24:32.960 --> 00:24:39.760
- Don't say you have dragged it here!
 - You thought it was romantic.

215
00:24:39.920 --> 00:24:47.360
It was romantic of him to build it, but I don't want the loom.

216
00:24:47.520 --> 00:24:53.360
- It is going out of my room.
 -Lena, place it in max room.

217
00:24:53.520 --> 00:24:57.360
He will certainly be surprised.

218
00:25:34.040 --> 00:25:36.880
