00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:05,760
Each autumn, pupils in grade 9
take the oral national test in Swedish.

2
00:00:05,920 --> 00:00:09,360
The objective is
to test your oral language skills.

3
00:00:09,520 --> 00:00:16,120
Your teacher wants to see how well you
can converse and reflect on the subject.

4
00:00:16,280 --> 00:00:21,600
You will get to read or watch something
that you then will discuss in a group.

5
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:23,880
Here is an exercise and a few tips-

6
00:00:24,040 --> 00:00:27,040
-to boost your confidence
ahead of the test.

7
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:30,760
Gather a few people-

8
00:00:30,920 --> 00:00:35,120
-and pick a text for everyone
to read quietly to themselves.

9
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:39,160
For instance, a one-page short story.

10
00:00:39,320 --> 00:00:43,840
Then try to write a summary
in a few sentences.

11
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,600
Note down any questions that you have
and write a discussion question.

12
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:53,960
When everyone has written
their summary and questions-

13
00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:58,920
-start by having everyone present
their summary of the text.

14
00:00:59,080 --> 00:01:04,640
Then you share your views on the text
and the questions that you had.

15
00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:07,120
Finally, read the discussion questions.

16
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:11,280
Try to take turns both leading
and participating in the discussion.

17
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:14,720
Tips:

18
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:19,280
Try to actively listen
and participate in the discussion.

19
00:01:19,440 --> 00:01:22,520
That makes it easier
to follow the conversation-

20
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:26,880
-ask questions and follow-up questions
and reflect on the topic.

21
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:33,600
When presenting an opinion,
it needs to be backed up.

22
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:37,000
So consider the reason
behind your opinion.

23
00:01:37,160 --> 00:01:41,040
You could also use an example
when sharing your view.

24
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:45,720
If you liked the text,
what was it about it that you liked?

25
00:01:45,880 --> 00:01:48,880
Was there a specific part,
a character description-

26
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:53,960
-or a specific paragraph
that you liked in particular? And why?

27
00:01:57,240 --> 00:02:03,040
You could also compare the text,
or your views, to your own experiences.

28
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:08,920
Have you been in a similar situation
to the character in the text?

29
00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:13,480
Try to find parallels between the text
and your everyday life-

30
00:02:13,640 --> 00:02:18,040
-and ask if anyone in the group
shares your experience.

31
00:02:19,960 --> 00:02:22,880
Good to bear in mind:

32
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:28,200
Listen carefully to the instructions and
participate actively in the discussion.

33
00:02:29,320 --> 00:02:33,800
You might feel nervous talking in front
of others, but you're not alone.

34
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:37,360
It's the first time
for everyone in your class.

35
00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:42,440
Remember to listen
and show respect for others' opinions.

36
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:45,800
And make sure to eat
and get a good night's sleep-

37
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:48,560
-so that you have enough energy
for the test.

38
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:52,520
The National Agency for Education
has mock tests on their website-

39
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:56,680
-that might be helpful to read through.
Good luck!
