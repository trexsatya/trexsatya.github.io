1
00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:01,200
Sartre ...

2
00:00:01,480 --> 00:00:02,720
Sartre ...

3
00:00:03,680 --> 00:00:04,840
Sartre!

4
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:05,600
Sartre?

5
00:00:05,720 --> 00:00:07,340
I'll say "Sartre".

6
00:00:07,460 --> 00:00:13,600
My name is Joakim, welcome to this lesson on Jean-Paul Sartre-one of the greatest philosophers of the 20th century.

7
00:00:20,380 --> 00:00:25,920
Anxiety is an unpleasant feeling why we subconsciously try to deny our freedom.

8
00:00:26,140 --> 00:00:30,820
If we are so free we must choose, and then we will also be responsible for our lives.

9
00:00:31,140 --> 00:00:36,940
Since we also show the way for our fellow human beings, the choices become difficult and anxious.

10
00:00:37,140 --> 00:00:40,520
With our choices and actions we don't just create ourselves

11
00:00:40,520 --> 00:00:44,460
Without also a picture of how we want man to be.

12
00:00:45,220 --> 00:00:50,220
“In fact, it's not a single one of our actions that are not, at the same time it creates it

13
00:00:50,220 --> 00:00:56,840
Man we want to be, also creates a picture of man as we believe she should be.

14
00:00:57,080 --> 00:01:03,160
Choosing to be that or it means at the same time that you affirm the value of what you choose,

15
00:01:03,160 --> 00:01:05,880
For you never choose anything bad.

16
00:01:06,360 --> 00:01:12,340
What you choose is always good, and nothing can be good for yourself without being for everyone. "

17
00:01:13,100 --> 00:01:20,600
Our attempts to deny our freedom are in fact attempts to escape the anxiety that comes with the elections.

18
00:01:20,820 --> 00:01:23,640
But anxiety is something positive, says Sartre.

19
00:01:23,780 --> 00:01:27,040
It shows that we are free and have choices.

20
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:32,520
In short, trying to escape their anxiety means denying their choices.

21
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:35,420
We have a responsibility that is total,

22
00:01:35,420 --> 00:01:40,560
We can never renounce it by blaming, for example, cowardice, says Sartre.

23
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:42,820
Then we choose to be cowardly.

24
00:01:43,060 --> 00:01:48,360
As is well known, we choose our essence through our choices - and thus also the cowardice.

25
00:01:49,080 --> 00:01:54,500
The anxiety arises as we can never fully review the consequences of our choices.

26
00:01:54,740 --> 00:01:58,680
It is an anxiety for the future, for what nothing should be filled with.

27
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:04,520
This is an anxiety we can never escape as it is inextricably linked to being human.

28
00:02:04,660 --> 00:02:10,260
But the anxiety is something essentially positive as it shows that we have a free will.

29
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:16,360
This view of the foundation of anxiety differs from, for example, psychologist Sigmund Freud who considered

30
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:21,180
That it had to do with the past, with traumatic childhood experiences.

31
00:02:21,500 --> 00:02:24,960
Because our freedom is intimately associated with anxiety

32
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:28,220
We often try to flee our freedom and the responsibility it brings with it.

33
00:02:28,420 --> 00:02:33,100
We believe that things must be in a special way and close your eyes to the alternatives.

34
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:37,740
We then say no to ourselves instead of to our situation.

35
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:40,600
This calls Sartre "bad faith".

36
00:02:41,140 --> 00:02:44,240
We believe that we are subject to our life conditions.

37
00:02:44,340 --> 00:02:49,800
We think we are cowardly, we think we need to follow traditions or cultural norms.

38
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:54,500
We do not realize that we choose to be cowardly, that we blame circumstances.

39
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:59,140
This belief does not disconnect us from responsibility, even if we think it does.

40
00:02:59,320 --> 00:03:06,100
We are always responsible for our actions and choices, even when we choose not to choose, not to use our freedom.

41
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:12,660
Man is by its nature, but our fear of freedom makes us flee into bad faith.

42
00:03:12,980 --> 00:03:17,140
We see ourselves as victims of the circumstances or as tiles in a game.

43
00:03:17,300 --> 00:03:22,140
Sartre sees it as its most important task to wake us up from this evil faith.

44
00:03:22,340 --> 00:03:26,560
He sees three ways to deny his freedom through bad faith:

45
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:31,340
Make a thing, go up in a role and become a dozen people.

46
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:39,340
When you make a thing you do not understand that you cannot influence your situation, so it makes yourself a thing.

47
00:03:39,460 --> 00:03:42,600
You can be taken like a doll or led like a dog.

48
00:03:42,760 --> 00:03:47,020
You blame your childhood or on your intoxication - as if you were mechanical.

49
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:50,680
You let things happen and blame on weakness or inability.

50
00:03:50,760 --> 00:03:56,660
One imagines that circumstances govern, that society, upbringing or the biological heritage

51
00:03:56,660 --> 00:04:00,660
Has characterized and shaped one's life - that you are your fate.

52
00:04:01,180 --> 00:04:05,720
Another way to deny one's freedom is by going up in a role,

53
00:04:05,720 --> 00:04:10,000
to tell yourself that one is predetermined for someone else's purpose.

54
00:04:10,180 --> 00:04:14,920
This role is determined by others - by the family, by the authorities or by God.

55
00:04:15,300 --> 00:04:18,560
You not just play a role, you are the role.

56
00:04:18,740 --> 00:04:22,920
The clearer the role is designed, the better the hiding place it becomes.

57
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:26,320
If you have uniform on, an order becomes a law.

58
00:04:26,540 --> 00:04:32,360
The soldier who goes out to war and blindly obeys every order has resigned the possibilities of freedom

59
00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:34,940
and identifies with their role.

60
00:04:35,260 --> 00:04:41,660
The reason why German soldiers could participate in the Nazi mass murder was just that, says Sartre.

61
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:47,860
Hidden in their roles they took no personal responsibility, they said no to themselves.

62
00:04:48,020 --> 00:04:51,660
The responsibility was always somewhere else, not with them.

63
00:04:52,060 --> 00:04:57,420
The big problem with this is that the role exists before playing it.

64
00:04:57,820 --> 00:05:02,200
If you want to play a play, roles and replicas are already predetermined.

65
00:05:02,440 --> 00:05:06,600
In the same way, it is with the roles we voluntarily take on everyday life.

66
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:10,000
Each role limits our freedom.

67
00:05:10,640 --> 00:05:15,520
A third way to protect against anxiety is to live as a dozen man

68
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:18,940
- A reasoning that Sartre has taken over from Søren Kierkegaard.

69
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:23,520
One lives unengaged, listening to the music, they see movies, visit the places

70
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:25,700
and performs the actions that "everyone else" does.

71
00:05:25,880 --> 00:05:30,220
This just to have listened, seen and visited everything you should have done.

72
00:05:30,380 --> 00:05:34,520
We try to free ourselves from the elections by becoming just like everyone else.

73
00:05:34,820 --> 00:05:39,620
We humans thus strive to rationalize our choices and freedom.

74
00:05:39,760 --> 00:05:43,560
We are looking for answers and guidelines that do not exist, says Sartre.

75
00:05:43,780 --> 00:05:50,860
Nothing wrong with being "average" but the risk is that you end up in a superficial life full of illegitimate acts.

76
00:05:51,380 --> 00:05:56,560
We humans need to be seen, from the eyes of the environment and assessments.

77
00:05:56,940 --> 00:06:01,920
That is why we strive to appear happy and successful for the surroundings.

78
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:06,300
But what really happens when we are caught with something embarrassing,

79
00:06:06,300 --> 00:06:08,620
When we lose the mask and start to be ashamed?

80
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:15,360
Being caught, being seen means being transformed from subject to object.

81
00:06:15,580 --> 00:06:19,920
We become the subject of other people's values and are assessed.

82
00:06:20,060 --> 00:06:26,420
At that moment we stop for a moment to exist as a human being and become a thing in the eyes of others.

83
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:33,120
This, says Sartre, is the other's look - the rightful judge of who you actually are.

84
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:38,120
We ourselves mix ourselves with the one we believe or wish to be.

85
00:06:38,300 --> 00:06:43,900
When you are seen by others, you suddenly get a view of yourself and the action you have performed.

86
00:06:44,100 --> 00:06:45,280
You are ashamed.

87
00:06:45,980 --> 00:06:50,140
For ourselves, we can only be a subject, a self.

88
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:55,460
If we want to know who we are, we must first become an object, a thing.

89
00:06:55,780 --> 00:07:00,340
Only in relation to others we know what our performance is worth.

90
00:07:00,520 --> 00:07:05,320
Concepts such as beauty, talent and talent become completely meaningless without a yardstick,

91
00:07:05,320 --> 00:07:07,840
Without a relationship with the fellow human beings.

92
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:12,260
You need the other to understand yourself, says Sartre,

93
00:07:12,260 --> 00:07:16,960
And adds that "one cannot possibly be vulgar in solitude".

94
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:20,300
“I've just made a ridiculous or vulgar gesture.

95
00:07:20,540 --> 00:07:26,240
This gesture hooks up to me, I neither condemns nor judge it.

96
00:07:26,940 --> 00:07:29,240
I simply live it.

97
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:32,960
But now I suddenly raise my head.

98
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:35,640
Someone was there and saw me.

99
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:40,560
Suddenly I realize how vulgar my gesture was and I'm ashamed ... ”

100
00:07:40,980 --> 00:07:47,560
The other is thus needed to understand himself, but the other is also a constant source of discomfort.

101
00:07:47,860 --> 00:07:52,260
Our lives largely consist of trying to realize our dreams.

102
00:07:52,440 --> 00:07:55,680
But the job you are looking for also wants someone else for.

103
00:07:55,780 --> 00:08:00,740
The other has plans, he tries to organize his surroundings and control it.

104
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:06,660
The risk is great for collisions and conflicts as our projects collide with each other.

105
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:11,580
You try to control the other but the same does the other with you.

106
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:16,540
We try to see through each other, valuing each other, putting labels on each other

107
00:08:16,540 --> 00:08:21,800
- We objectify other people, see them as if they were things that could be predicted.

108
00:08:21,900 --> 00:08:29,460
Similarly, the surroundings objectify you, even though you are not reducing to something predictable.

109
00:08:29,860 --> 00:08:33,880
How, then, can positive relationships between people be possible

110
00:08:33,880 --> 00:08:37,280
In a life where we constantly reduce each other to things?

111
00:08:37,520 --> 00:08:44,740
In his philosophy of love, Sartre examined the possibilities and conditions of love and judged them as problematic.

112
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:49,380
Love presupposes two free conscious individuals

113
00:08:49,380 --> 00:08:54,120
At the same time as both parties have a need to control and own.

114
00:08:54,380 --> 00:09:01,300
We demand promises of the one we love;
 You have to be faithful, you have to come back, you must always love me!

115
00:09:01,560 --> 00:09:04,000
We try to enslave the one we love.

116
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:08,900
At the same time, we are annoyed by these promises when we are exposed to them ourselves.

117
00:09:09,260 --> 00:09:14,860
On the one hand, we want to own the other's freedom, on the other hand being voluntarily loved.

118
00:09:15,100 --> 00:09:18,740
What then does it serve to try to force someone to love one?

119
00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:24,520
Thus, love must be both bound and free, a voluntary captivity.

120
00:09:24,860 --> 00:09:29,260
Maybe you can shorten the moment to see the other as an object.

121
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:33,680
Maybe we feel for a while not superfluous but on the whole

122
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:37,420
Staying love "a hopelessness" says Sartre.

123
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:43,780
He therefore highlights the free relationship as the best possible solution,

124
00:09:43,780 --> 00:09:48,560
Something he practiced with his life companion and colleague Simone de Beauvoir.

125
00:09:49,140 --> 00:09:55,080
According to Sartre, money was a big and contributing factor to why people did not feel free.

126
00:09:55,260 --> 00:10:00,660
The unfair distribution of money and the misery it contributed to, annoyed him.

127
00:10:00,820 --> 00:10:04,240
He saw capitalism as an inhibitory factor in people's lives

128
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:08,660
And something that makes us believe that we have to live in a special way.

129
00:10:08,960 --> 00:10:15,800
Sartre was a dedicated communist and strived to release the individual from materialistic life.

130
00:10:15,960 --> 00:10:21,860
Capitalism limited people's freedom and was therefore something that would actively be fought.

131
00:10:22,040 --> 00:10:27,780
He visited Fidel Castro and Che Guevara in Cuba, the latter mentioned by Sartre as

132
00:10:27,780 --> 00:10:32,580
"Not only intellectual, but also the most complete person in our time".

133
00:10:33,020 --> 00:10:39,160
During the 1960s, he supported, along with the Beauvoir, the student occupation in Paris

134
00:10:39,160 --> 00:10:42,080
and was repeatedly arrested by the police.

135
00:10:42,340 --> 00:10:48,760
However, he was pardoned by France's President Charles de Gaulle with the words "man arrests Voltaire".

136
00:10:49,020 --> 00:10:52,320
Voltaire was a 18th-century, philosopher and debater

137
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:56,460
which was forced to flee to England because he has made himself uncomfortable in France.

138
00:10:56,880 --> 00:11:01,880
Sartre came to be a powerful opponent of the Vietnam War and started together

139
00:11:01,880 --> 00:11:07,480
With, among other things, the British philosopher Bertrand Russell "International War Crimes Tribunal"

140
00:11:07,480 --> 00:11:10,040
to highlight the US war crime.

141
00:11:10,340 --> 00:11:14,720
Furthermore, he was deeply involved in the Palestinians' struggle against Israel.

142
00:11:14,920 --> 00:11:21,140
Towards the end of his life, he abandoned communism, largely in protest against the development of the Soviet Union,

143
00:11:21,140 --> 00:11:24,180
And then anarchist titled himself.

144
00:11:24,700 --> 00:11:29,780
Sartre's thoughts have come to have great impact for many people seeking meaning to life

145
00:11:29,780 --> 00:11:32,900
But who are not willing to turn to religion.

146
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:38,600
He succeeded with the piece of art to maintain purpose in a world without inherent meaning

147
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:43,260
by focusing on the subjective at the expense of the objective.

148
00:11:43,580 --> 00:11:51,560
When Sartre died in April 1980, 50,000 people gathered on Paris streets to witness the funeral train

149
00:11:51,560 --> 00:11:54,040
And pay tribute to the great thinker.
