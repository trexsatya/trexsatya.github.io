1
00:00:02,080 --> 00:00:06,000
You know the feeling
when you're taking a test.

2
00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:13,160
You get the test, look at it,
and you're absolutely clueless.

3
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:21,480
If you haven't studied,
you can suit yourself.

4
00:00:21,640 --> 00:00:27,080
If you have studied and still don't get it,
there are strategies-

5
00:00:27,240 --> 00:00:31,040
-to rid that brain fart feeling.

6
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:39,120
If you find it impossible to focus,
you can try a relaxation exercise.

7
00:00:40,120 --> 00:00:45,160
Close your eyes.
Work your shoulders up and down.

8
00:00:45,320 --> 00:00:49,520
Put your hand on your stomach
and breathe deeply.

9
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:52,000
Massage your fingers.

10
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:56,760
Carefully move your head
and rub your shoulders.

11
00:00:56,920 --> 00:01:00,720
This will make you relax
and alleviate stress.

12
00:01:00,880 --> 00:01:06,920
You start your circulation, get oxygen
to your brain and clear your mind.

13
00:01:10,120 --> 00:01:15,400
Take another look at the questions.
Still nothing?

14
00:01:15,560 --> 00:01:18,880
All right,
never mind the questions for now.

15
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:22,880
Write down what know
on a piece of paper.

16
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:28,640
That way you brainstorm
and think more freely.

17
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:34,240
It may help to draw pictures,
as this uses another part of your brain.

18
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:38,560
Go back to the piece of paper
once the stress is gone-

19
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:43,000
-and the answers have
a better chance of coming to you.

20
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:54,760
Don't force words you can't think of.
Write something else in the meantime.

21
00:01:54,920 --> 00:01:59,840
Leave it as a placeholder
and continue with the test.

22
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:05,800
When you read through your answers,
the word might suddenly come to you.

23
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:13,600
You can also ask your teacher for help.

24
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:17,560
Ask questions. Don't just say:
"I don't get it."

25
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:20,000
Be more specific.

26
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:24,800
"What does this word mean?"
"What is the question about?"

27
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:31,200
If your teacher elaborates the question,
you may remember the answer.

28
00:02:35,640 --> 00:02:41,080
If sounds cause you stress,
you can try to block them.

29
00:02:41,240 --> 00:02:45,040
There might be some ear muffs
in the classroom.

30
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:48,200
Or you can bring your own earplugs.

31
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:52,600
Some tips to rid the brain fart feeling:

32
00:02:52,760 --> 00:02:58,200
Relaxation exercises can
alleviate stress and help you think.

33
00:02:58,360 --> 00:03:04,280
Write down all you know on a
piece of paper instead of getting stuck.

34
00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:07,240
Draw pictures.

35
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:11,480
If you get stuck on a question,
write down a placeholder.

36
00:03:11,640 --> 00:03:16,160
Ask your teacher for help,
perhaps to read the question aloud.

37
00:03:16,320 --> 00:03:22,360
Block out stressful sounds.
Wear ear muffs or earplugs.
