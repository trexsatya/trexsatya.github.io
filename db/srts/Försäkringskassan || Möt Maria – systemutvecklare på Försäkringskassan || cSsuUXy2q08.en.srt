1
00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:08,839
The actual prerequisite for the officers to be able to do their jobs and because

2
00:00:08,839 --> 00:00:12,622
Customers should be able to log in to “My Pages” on the web is that all

3
00:00:12,622 --> 00:00:13,960
The systems work.

4
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:17,359
And this is where we system developers come in.

5
00:00:17,399 --> 00:00:20,120
If there is a glitch in the systems, people may not get

6
00:00:20,120 --> 00:00:23,559
money and can't buy food or pay the rent.

7
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:26,160
And then it is up to us to fix it.

8
00:00:26,440 --> 00:00:32,320
It is a challenge to keep all technology modern and reliable without sacrificing quality.

9
00:00:32,719 --> 00:00:35,600
We need to be able to update and clog Safety Hole

10
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:39,119
While we work in a system where it must not be wrong.

11
00:00:39,439 --> 00:00:42,640
If an incident were to arise, we will release everything else that we have

12
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:46,280
For the hands and the entire team is helped to solve the problem.

13
00:00:47,240 --> 00:00:52,280
It is something magical when everything flows on and the payouts run on.

14
00:00:54,840 --> 00:00:58,159
We have a great responsibility and I feel proud of the job,

15
00:00:58,159 --> 00:01:03,439
To feel that we make people's everyday life work and do good, for real.
