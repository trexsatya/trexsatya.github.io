1
00:00:00,760 --> 00:00:04,180
The ancient philosophy, with its questioning of old truths,

2
00:00:04,320 --> 00:00:08,080
Come during the Middle Ages on collision with the teachings of Christianity.

3
00:00:08,600 --> 00:00:12,360
Where philosophy emphasized rational and free thinking

4
00:00:12,620 --> 00:00:18,020
emphasized Christianity and the inadequacy of human reason.

5
00:00:18,520 --> 00:00:21,980
Because of the great power and influence of the church during the period

6
00:00:22,100 --> 00:00:25,940
Most philosophers also came to be clearly linked to the church.

7
00:00:26,620 --> 00:00:33,120
Therefore, the philosophy came to deal mainly in the Middle Ages to address issues of religious nature

8
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:38,920
- for example the theodicÃ© problem (how can God be good and almighty

9
00:00:38,920 --> 00:00:41,780
when there is evil and suffering in the world).

10
00:00:43,240 --> 00:00:50,820
An example we find in Bishop Augustinus, born in the present Algeria, at that time part of the Roman Empire.

11
00:00:51,480 --> 00:00:58,400
Inspired by what is called newly plated, an interpretation of Plato's idea theory, he came to bring together

12
00:00:58,780 --> 00:01:04.720
Philosophy and religion by considering the Platonic ideas as thoughts in God's consciousness.

13
00:01:05,820 --> 00:01:11,640
Just as Plato adds greater value to the world of ideas than the world of mind, Augustine will influence

14
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:19,240
Medieval Christianity to exalting the soul and downplaying the physical and material.

15
00:01:19,640 --> 00:01:25,720
When the woman in the Middle Ages (and perhaps even today) came to be more associated with physicality than man,

16
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:32,420
came this depreciation of the bodily indirectly to become a dismissal of the woman.

17
00:01:34,060 --> 00:01:41,320
Another medieval philosopher, and like one of Christianity's great theologians, was Thomas by Aquino.

18
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:48,740
From a philosophical perspective, he is best known for adapting Aristotle's theories to the Christian faith.

19
00:01:48,980 --> 00:01:53.560
Aristotle's writings had been forgotten in Europe for 1000 years,

20
00:01:53,780 --> 00:01:58,580
But in the Middle East, his writings had been managed by Arab philosophers.

21
00:01:58,800 --> 00:02:05.940
During the 13th century, these books had begun to find their way back to Europe in the form of war changes from crusades,

22
00:02:06,120 --> 00:02:12,420
And Thomas of Aquino came to integrate the Christian worldview with the Aristotelian system.

23
00:02:12,820 --> 00:02:17,160
Christianity would be built on reason and logic,

24
00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:21,800
And the literal Bible interpretation was allowed to be problematized.

25
00:02:23,540 --> 00:02:29,080
Thus, Aristotle came to contribute to the resurrecting of the classic ideas

26
00:02:29,080 --> 00:02:32,080
And the historical period called the Renaissance.

27
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:38,140
This new era, which lasted from the early 1400s to about 1600,

28
00:02:38,220 --> 00:02:42,520
is usually considered a rebirth of the ancient ideals.

29
00:02:42,700 --> 00:02:47,820
The power of the church decreased and science, literature and art thrived.

30
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:53.020
Economic, social and political changes occur in society as a result of inventions

31
00:02:53,020 --> 00:02:56,220
Like the gun, the compass and the printing print art.

32
00:02:56,600 --> 00:03:03,360
A clearer dividing line between theology (the doctrine of God) and philosophy is restored.

33
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:10,140
The English philosopher Francis Bacon is considered one of the precursors to the modern philosophy

34
00:03:10,160 --> 00:03:16,360
when he breaks with the ideals of the Middle Ages and requires philosophy to be based on experiences

35
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:20,280
And scientific conclusions, so -called induction.

36
00:03:20,780 --> 00:03:27,540
Thus, he also became a precursor to the knowledge theoretical school called empirism.

37
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:32,800
According to this, all knowledge is ultimately based on the experience of senses

38
00:03:32,920 --> 00:03:36,620
- So they experience we get through our minds.

39
00:03:37,340 --> 00:03:41,760
Now the puzzle pieces were in place for a new generation of philosophers.

40
00:03:41,880 --> 00:03:46,000
Where the Renaissance thinkers were mainly inspired by the story

41
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:50,540
Wanted the intellectuals of the 17th century to find new ways forward.

42
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:55,180
And with the enlightenment time, modern philosophy was born.
