00:00:00,420 --> 00:00:04,920
Hello philosophers, my name is Joakim and welcome to this first of two videos where we examine

2
00:00:04,920 --> 00:00:07,980
Friedrich Nietzsche's philosophical ideas.

3
00:00:08,420 --> 00:00:14,240
We will investigate his view of morality, nihilism, suffering, truth, superhuman,

4
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:16,580
Amor Fati and eternal repetition.

5
00:00:23,360 --> 00:00:27,120
Nietzsche, maybe more than any other philosopher, is open to interpretation.

6
00:00:27,340 --> 00:00:32,960
With statements like "what doesn't kill me makes me stronger", "God is dead!
 And we have killed him! "

7
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:38,680
And "the world is beautiful but man is a disease" is his philosophy both tickling and provocative.

8
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:44,540
That is probably why more than 20,000 different books have been published about him and his writings.

9
00:00:45,020 --> 00:00:50,840
He was born in 1844 in a small village in the eastern part of Germany where his father was a priest.

10
00:00:51,080 --> 00:00:57,000
He was considered a wonderful child and became a professor at the University of Basel at the age of 24.

11
00:00:57,380 --> 00:00:59,340
However, his career was not successful.

12
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:04,360
He got tired of his colleagues, gave up his job and moved to the Swiss Alps

13
00:01:04,360 --> 00:01:06,980
Where he lived alone and wrote on his books.

14
00:01:07,640 --> 00:01:11,120
He was sickly, opium dependent and disliked his family:

15
00:01:11,420 --> 00:01:15,800
"I don't like my mother and it's painful to hear as much as hearing my sister's voice".

16
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:18,980
Women rejected him and his books did not sell.

17
00:01:19,260 --> 00:01:24,340
Only 44 years old, he had a mental breakdown when he saw a horse being whipped by the cousin.

18
00:01:24,680 --> 00:01:28,740
He ran to embrace the horse screaming "I understand you!".

19
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:36,180
He never recovered, sank deep into madness and spent the remainder of his life at a mental hospital.

20
00:01:36,760 --> 00:01:43,380
Furthermore, he was vegetarian, abstinent in terms of coffee and alcohol, and had a crazy big mustache.

21
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:49,220
He was strongly influenced by Schopenhauer's thoughts that the world we perceive is our own performance,

22
00:01:49,220 --> 00:01:51,760
Thus, a purely subjective experience.

23
00:01:52,380 --> 00:01:57,080
Although he came to deviations from his philosophy, his perception of his life remained

24
00:01:57,080 --> 00:01:59,680
Related to Schopenhauer's pessimism.

25
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:06,260
For Nietzsche, philosophy was not only abstract theories, but had a practical purpose.

26
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:14,380
The philosophy was intended to facilitate the emergence of a new and better type of man who devoted his life to development,

27
00:02:14,380 --> 00:02:20,620
self -realization and life -affirming - a man who was not held back by moral views

28
00:02:20,620 --> 00:02:25,240
Like right and wrong, a man who affirmed the animal in itself.

29
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:29,540
Nietzsche saw himself as a guide for such a person.

30
00:02:29,880 --> 00:02:37,160
“Only these are my readers, my rightful readers, my predetermined readers.
 What does the rest matter?

31
00:02:37,160 --> 00:02:39,040
The rest is just people. "

32
00:02:40,140 --> 00:02:43,860
Central to Nietzsche's philosophy is the concept of "the will to power"

33
00:02:43,860 --> 00:02:47,980
which should be seen as a response to Schopenhauer's "the will to live".

34
00:02:48,380 --> 00:02:53,200
Where Schopenhauer believes that everything in the universe is an expression of the will to live, Nietzsche said that

35
00:02:53,200 --> 00:03:00,600
The main driving force is not life but power - "an inexhaustible, generating vitality".

36
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:07,100
According to him, the operation is to expand his power stronger than the operation to adapt and survive.

37
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:12,000
This will to power is wherever there is life, and even the strongest of creatures

38
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,680
will risk their lives in their quest for even more power.

39
00:03:16,320 --> 00:03:20,540
Unlike Schopenhauer, however, Nietzsche does not see the will as a negative force

40
00:03:20,540 --> 00:03:24,920
Without something to affirm even if it can sometimes be destructive.

41
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:29,400
While Schopenhauer sees the pity as a positive resort,

42
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:32,780
It seems to Nietzsche as a life -inhibiting factor.

43
00:03:33,660 --> 00:03:39,920
This should therefore be interpreted as a psychological explanation for human behavior and an explanation for why we devote

44
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:43,820
We ate risks in life, such as warfare and competition.

45
00:03:44,260 --> 00:03:50,880
It is the power of power that spurs man to everything she takes on: progress, ambitions, self -realization,

46
00:03:50,880 --> 00:03:58,140
Personal maturity, the desire to reach the highest possible position in life - everything is products of the will to power.

47
00:03:58,780 --> 00:04:03,980
Nietzsche's exemplifies with the ancient Greek heroes and aristocrats that not mainly

48
00:04:03,980 --> 00:04:08,320
Searched a long life, without a life of power, honor and greatness.

49
00:04:08,740 --> 00:04:15,260
Here we also expect what came to be Nietzsche's big struggle - a questioning of the traditional morality.

50
00:04:15,640 --> 00:04:21,100
If now the will to power is what drives life, how come it is often considered morally wrong

51
00:04:21,100 --> 00:04:23,580
Or ugly to stand for that opinion?

52
00:04:24,820 --> 00:04:30,020
Nietzsche agreed with Schopenhauer that there is no God or any immortal soul.

53
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:35,240
They also agreed that life is a meaningless story characterized by suffering

54
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:38,560
And guided by an irrational force that can be called the will.

55
00:04:38,940 --> 00:04:44,440
However, he rejected Schopenhauer's conclusion that we should feel disgust for this world.

56
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:49,420
On the contrary, he meant that we should live our lives so that we get as much out of them.

57
00:04:49,960 --> 00:04:53,500
A large part of Nietzsche's philosophy is about just this

58
00:04:53,500 --> 00:04:57,880
- How to live a rich life in a meaningless and godless world.

59
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:01,420
Nietzsche had extreme things to say about Christianity.

60
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:08,640
"Throughout the New Testament, there is only one person worth respecting: Pilate, the Roman governor".

61
00:05:08,940 --> 00:05:13,780
According to the Bible, Pontius Pilate was the person who decided to crucify Jesus.

62
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:19,760
Christianity, in Nietzsche's interpretation, had arisen from Roman slaves who had lacked the power to achieve

63
00:05:19,760 --> 00:05:24,760
What they really wanted and instead created a philosophy that made virtue of their cowardice.

64
00:05:25,220 --> 00:05:31,600
Christians, whom he called "Die Herde" - the flock, also wanted to enjoy life (intellectual challenges,

65
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:39,160
Creativity, six mm) but were too incapable to achieve a high level of pleasure and satisfaction.

66
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:44,540
Therefore, they joined a hypocritical faith where they condemned what they wanted but were too weak

67
00:05:44,540 --> 00:05:49,140
To achieve - and paid tribute to what they happened to have, but did not demand.

68
00:05:49,620 --> 00:05:56,980
In the Christian value system, sexual inability became purity.
 Weakness became goodness.
 Apathy became patience,

69
00:05:56,980 --> 00:06:00,180
And inability to revenge was forgiveness.

70
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:05,780
According to Nietzsche, Christianity was a gigantic machine of bitter denial.

71
00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:11,700
"After coming into contact with a religious man, I always feel that I have to wash my hands."

72
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:16,660
Nietzsche meant that what made it possible for us humans to leave the animal stage

73
00:06:16,660 --> 00:06:22,840
and developing a civilization was that the weak incessantly was eliminated by the strong,

74
00:06:22,840 --> 00:06:26,840
The inept of the capable ones, the stupid of the intelligent.

75
00:06:27,420 --> 00:06:30,880
Thanks to these processes repeated through the millennia

76
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:33,820
The man developed into the creature she is today.

77
00:06:34,760 --> 00:06:38,080
But about 2000 years ago, something unfortunate happened.

78
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:45,300
The moralists, with Socrates and Jesus at the forefront, then came and said that this development process was wrong.

79
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:50,140
They claimed that there should be laws that protect the weak against the strong ones.

80
00:06:50,380 --> 00:06:57,580
They meant that justice would go before strength, that the earth would belong to the lazy, not the entrepreneurs.

81
00:06:58,120 --> 00:07:02,340
“Independent thinking and powerful intellect is considered dangerous;

82
00:07:02,340 --> 00:07:07,880
Everything that lifts an individual over the mass scares, and is henceforth referred to as evil. "

83
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:13,060
In every human being there is an instinct Nietzsche calls flock behavior,

84
00:07:13,060 --> 00:07:15,340
A need to adapt to the masses.

85
00:07:15,780 --> 00:07:22,020
Often this comes as an expression in adapting your morals, ie what you think is right and wrong in society.

86
00:07:22,520 --> 00:07:26,560
"Morality is the best of all devices for leading humanity in ruin"

87
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:29,120
Nietzsche proclaimed in the book "Antichrist".

88
00:07:29,620 --> 00:07:34,640
Such a morality, which was accepted by the masses, called Nietzsche for slave morality.

89
00:07:34,820 --> 00:07:37,840
He meant that this morality served a clear purpose

90
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:44,900
- Giving mediocre individuals the conviction that their weakness is not an error, but a strength.

91
00:07:45,300 --> 00:07:50,660
"I've often laughed at these wavers who thought they were good just because they were missing chlorine,"

92
00:07:50,660 --> 00:07:53,560
Nietzsche wrote in "So Zarathustra".

93
00:07:54,060 --> 00:07:58,960
In this way, slave morality claims that properties it itself lack are evil.

94
00:07:59,300 --> 00:08:02,360
Through the slave morality, they gain weak respect.

95
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:08,340
Sheep-like qualities are hailed as good, and individuals are thus pressed to become weak and obedient.

96
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:14,360
Therefore, we must, Nietzsche, flee the shackles of the slave morality and in its place create a new one,

97
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:18,620
Independent and life -affirming morals - the male.

98
00:08:18,980 --> 00:08:24,360
We have to fight the slave moral as the disease it is, but in order to succeed in this one must first

99
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:28,980
Physically separated from the shock and live a life in loneliness.

100
00:08:29,540 --> 00:08:34,660
Nietzsche meant that weak people structure their lives so they never have to reflect

101
00:08:34,660 --> 00:08:37,260
around the difficult questions of existence.

102
00:08:37,560 --> 00:08:44,540
But in order to achieve greatness in life, we must ponder the issues for which the shock is scared or too weak.

103
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,860
And for this we need our loneliness.

104
00:08:48,260 --> 00:08:54,080
“Because he now has to penetrate into the depths of existence with curious questions on his lips: Why do I live?

105
00:08:54,080 --> 00:09:00,960
What lessons has life taught me?
 How do I become what I am and why do I suffer from being who I am? ”
