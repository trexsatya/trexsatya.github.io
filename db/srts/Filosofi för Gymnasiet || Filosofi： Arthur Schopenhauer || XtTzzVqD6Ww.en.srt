1
00:00:01,520 --> 00:00:08,200
Like many philosophers before him, Schopenhauer tried to understand reality, and it was an evil world he saw.

2
00:00:08,500 --> 00:00:15,900
Animal life seemed horrific; Most creatures live on hunting, killing and devouring others -

3
00:00:15,900 --> 00:00:19,220
Life was literally a struggle with beaks and claws.

4
00:00:19,660 --> 00:00:24,620
His view of man was about the same; violence and injustice everywhere,

5
00:00:24,620 --> 00:00:29,120
Every single life was a meaningless tragedy that ends with death.

6
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:35.560
We live as slaves during our desires and life is a constant tour between suffering and boredom.

7
00:00:35,940 --> 00:00:41,360
Life is meaningless and the best thing would have been to never have ever been born ...

8
00:00:41,900 --> 00:00:47,120
Arthur Schopenhauer was born in the German city of Danzig (present Gdańsk in Poland)

9
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:52,520
and has not surprisingly come to be regarded as the great pessimist among the philosophers.

10
00:00:53,860 --> 00:00:58,460
To understand Schopenhauer, we must take our starting point in Immanuel Kant.

11
00:00:58,600 --> 00:01:01,380
Schopenhauer held on the whole with edge,

12
00:01:01,380 --> 00:01:04.840
But meant that he had made a couple of erroneous assumptions.

13
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:09.660
Schopenhauer tried to correct them and develop the theory.

14
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:16,500
Central to Kant's transcendental idealism is the division between the objective reality

15
00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:23,460
.

16
00:01:23,900 --> 00:01:27,540
Of these, only the latter we can have knowledge of.

17
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:31,800
We can never know what is beyond the human experience.

18
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:37,320
According to Kant we can never reach knowledge of the objective reality,

19
00:01:37,320 --> 00:01:40,920
But at the same time, it must exist independently of us.

20
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:47,200
Something (Tinget-in-Sig) must give rise to what we experience (Tinget-for-Mig),

21
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:54,100
Otherwise, the conclusion is that our experiences of the world arise from nothing - which would be illogical.

22
00:01:54,700 --> 00:02:02.080
Furthermore, he meant that time, space and causality (causal relationship) exist only in the phenomenon world

23
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:06.560
as they are the consequences of how our brain and our consciousness work.

24
00:02:07,640 --> 00:02:14,060
Here lies Kant's mistake, Schopenhauer said. If time and space are only the consequences of our consciousness,

25
00:02:14,060 --> 00:02:19,020
So we can draw a couple of important conclusions about objective reality - about Noumenon.

26
00:02:19,700 --> 00:02:24,240
Without time and space, the objective reality must be non-material,

27
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:28,660
because physical matter cannot exist beyond these dimensions.

28
00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:35,420
Another conclusion we can draw is that this non-material reality must be a singular.

29
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:40,460
For if you remove time and space, you remove the basic prerequisite for something

30
00:02:40,460 --> 00:02:42,980
Being able to be separate from something else.

31
00:02:43,940 --> 00:02:48,200
Even causality is bound to our experience of the world,

32
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:51,720
Thus, it is not something that exists in objective reality.

33
00:02:52,060 --> 00:02:57,180
From this Schopenhauer concludes that we cannot possibly tell you that anything in the noumenon

34
00:02:57,180 --> 00:03:00.120
Causes what we experience in the phenomenon world.

35
00:03:00,760 --> 00:03:05.680
It follows that we are the same as the experience itself.

36
00:03:06,020 --> 00:03:10,820
Everything is really one and the same as nothing cannot exist in plural.

37
00:03:11,480 --> 00:03:15,840
This means, according to Schopenhauer, that everything we perceive as reality

38
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:21,320
Actually, only mental creations - that "the world is my performance".

39
00:03:21,900 --> 00:03:27,340
This radical attitude towards the world makes Schopenhauer a philosophical idealist.

40
00:03:28,020 --> 00:03:29,840
Everything is basically one.

41
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:36,060
This non-material one is a huge force, completely without consciousness, intelligence or intentions.

42
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:41,160
What we perceive as reality is a manifestation of this force.

43
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:45.840
It is at the heart of everything that exists, and reveals itself in every natural force,

44
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:49,220
in every human action, and it is the one that drives the world.

45
00:04:06,160 --> 00:04:10,440
But what can we know about this force? Schopenhauer considered, like edge,

46
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:15,520
That we will never reach knowledge of the world by using our senses.

47
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:22,680
However, we can take advantage of the fact that there is one thing in the world we have direct knowledge of - our own body.

48
00:04:23,140 --> 00:04:29,260
We see inward and try to peel away the physical body (as it exists only in the phenomenon of phenomena)

49
00:04:29,380 --> 00:04:33,820
we find an internal operation characterized by a restless endeavor.

50
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:39,080
This operational force is at its most tangible during the sexual act or when our

51
00:04:39,080 --> 00:04:45,820
Survival instincts are activated, Schopenhauer calls the "will to live" or just "the will".

52
00:04:46,420 --> 00:04:50,260
All forms of life strive for reproduction and survival.

53
00:04:50,360 --> 00:04:57.640
Schopenhauer therefore concludes that all life forms, like us, are manifestations of "the desire to live".

54
00:04:58,420 --> 00:05:02.840
There was also no fundamental difference between what we call organic life

55
00:05:02,840 --> 00:05:07.600
(animals and plants) and the inorganic (non-living ting).

56
00:05:07,740 --> 00:05:12,880
Everything is manifestations of the will, and everything is basically one with everything else.

57
00:05:13,940 --> 00:05:17,120
The will drives us to constantly chase goals and dreams.

58
00:05:17,300 --> 00:05:22,800
We believe that we will be happy if we achieve what we are looking for, but soon the joy will have disappeared

59
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:27,140
And the will has been aiming for new dreams and goals. That's life.

60
00:05:27,340 --> 00:05:32,960
The will drives us further through the belief that we can achieve lasting happiness and satisfaction.

61
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:38,120
When we strive for something, we do it based on a state of deficiency - we lack something.

62
00:05:38,360 --> 00:05:44,000
We are dissatisfied with the current situation and long for something that is not yet ours.

63
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:49,180
The volatile joy we can sometimes experience when we have achieved a goal is according to Schopenhauer

64
00:05:49,180 --> 00:05:54,960
Not positive but negative as it indicates the transition from one deficiency to another.

65
00:05:56,460 --> 00:06:00.320
After reaching our goals, we are soon filled with boredom.

66
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:07,160
The only way to escape this is to create new goals in the belief that these will lead to lasting happiness.

67
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:14,240
Such is human life. We are all slaves during the insatiable will that is the foundation of everything.

68
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:17,720
As if this was not pessimistic enough, Schopenhauer meant that there is

69
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:22,020
Another tragic chapter in man's sad existence.

70
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:28,340
For unlike other animals, we are aware of what awaits after a miserable life of endeavor,

71
00:06:28,340 --> 00:06:34,580
Suffering and boredom - death and the complete annihilation of us as individuals.

72
00:06:35,780 --> 00:06:42,400
An important source of inspiration for Schopenhauer is the "Upanishads", one of Hinduism's holy writings,

73
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:48,180
Why his philosophy can be seen as a mix between Western and Eastern philosophy.

74
00:06:48,640 --> 00:06:55,200
In principle, he agreed with Hinduism and Buddhism but did not believe in karma, reincarnation or Nirvana.

75
00:06:55,940 --> 00:07:01,760
The similarities become clear if we compare Schopenhauer's philosophy with the "four truths of Buddhism"

76
00:07:01,760 --> 00:07:06.820
which deals with the cause of suffering and suspension. They read as follows:

77
00:07:07,460 --> 00:07:09.260
There is suffering in the world.

78
00:07:09,620 --> 00:07:11,980
The reason for the suffering is the desire.

79
00:07:12,420 --> 00:07:14,860
The desire can and must be wiped out.

80
00:07:15,220 --> 00:07:19,160
The road to extinguishing the desire is the eight -fold road.

81
00:07:20,260 --> 00:07:25,860
A philosopher whose world description is reminiscent of Schopenhauers was Baruch Spinoza.

82
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:31,440
He represented a pantheistic worldview and meant that everything in the world and the universe was one and the same

83
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:35,160
- A spiritual transcendent being, or God.

84
00:07:35,540 --> 00:07:39,660
The latter thought Schopenhauer, who was an atheist, was laughable.

85
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:45,400
He meant that a panteist who opened his eyes to all the misery in the world "must admit that a God who

86
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:51,000
would turn itself into a world like this, inevitably must be tormented by the devil ”.

87
00:07:52,120 --> 00:07:56,580
Instead of being a manifestation of God, Schopenhauer meant that the world was

88
00:07:56,580 --> 00:08:01,320
A manifestation of the will, a force that must be considered evil.

89
00:08:01,540 --> 00:08:06.840
As manifestations of the will, all life strives for nutrition, survival and propagation.

90
00:08:07,260 --> 00:08:10,500
Because organisms must feed on other organisms,

91
00:08:10,500 --> 00:08:14,780
And all organisms are manifestations of the will, the conclusion is that

92
00:08:14,780 --> 00:08:20,360
"The will must live on itself, because there is nothing except it, and that is a hungry will."

93
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:24,540
In an attempt to describe this evil and destructive will

94
00:08:24,540 --> 00:08:29,900
Schopenhauer recounts a story from the early European explorers:

95
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:36,220
“[We saw] a huge field completely covered with skeletons, and thought it was a battlefield.

96
00:08:36,300 --> 00:08:39,340
But it was nothing but skeleton from giant turtles,

97
00:08:39,340 --> 00:08:42,940
One and a half meters long, one meter wide, and equally high.

98
00:08:43,620 --> 00:08:48,820
These turtles came from the sea to lay their eggs, whereupon they were attacked by wild dogs.

99
00:08:49,260 --> 00:08:53,720
With their united strength, these dogs managed to turtle on their backs,

100
00:08:53,720 --> 00:09:01,320
Tear up their stomach and devour them to live. Then the tiger came and attacked the dogs.

101
00:09:01,700 --> 00:09:07,260
This misery has been repeated since a thousand and a thousand times, year in and year out.

102
00:09:07,620 --> 00:09:12,680
What benefit are these turtles born? For which crime do they have to suffer this anguish?

103
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:19,680
What is the point of this horror scene? The only answer is that it is the will that objectifies itself. "

104
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:25,840
Is there any way out, any solution to our misery? Both yes and no according to Schopenhauer.

105
00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:28,080
We will always lose against the will,

106
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:32,660
But there are a number of things we can do so as not to suffer as much during the journey.

107
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:38,080
However, suicide is not a way out, as the suicide only follows his operation to die.

108
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:44,480
In addition, at the moment of death, the will only move to another form of will.

109
00:09:45,300 --> 00:09:49,640
Schopenhauer identified three stages in the fight against will:

110
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:56,620
Although Schopenhauer meant that life was meaningless and filled with boredom, suffering and death,

111
00:09:56,620 --> 00:10:02,980
he claimed that occasional meaningful moments could temporarily release us from the misery of life.

112
00:10:03,460 --> 00:10:10,660
When we are engulfed by music, or admire a beautiful work of art, we become free from the power of will for a moment.

113
00:10:10,860 --> 00:10:13,980
We are no longer controlled by our desires and desires

114
00:10:13,980 --> 00:10:18,720
And we cease to exist as individuals to become one with the experience.

115
00:10:18,940 --> 00:10:24,060
These moments, however, only last in a moment, before returning to a normal state

116
00:10:24,060 --> 00:10:28,720
of desires and suffering - we are again slaves during the will.

117
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:33,880
This view of music and art has made Schopenhauer popular with musicians and writers.

118
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:39,940
An example of an author inspired by Schopenhauer is August Strindberg.

119
00:10:40,420 --> 00:10:44,540
In order to fight the will within it, one must first gain insight into it.

120
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:50,220
But this is difficult when our brain is mainly developed to satisfy the desire of the will -

121
00:10:50,220 --> 00:10:54,200
- Survival and reproduction - not to see the truth.

122
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:57,320
Most people will never realize the truth,

123
00:10:57,320 --> 00:11:01,100
And will therefore live as egoists, Schopenhauer meant.

124
00:11:01,480 --> 00:11:04,000
Their actions are performed by self -interest,

125
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:09.080
And they are doomed to a life in misery, the unattainable happiness was chased.

126
00:11:09,800 --> 00:11:14,960
Only a few will see through the lie and realize that everything is one.

127
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:20,800
According to Schopenhauer, this insight will lead to a state of compassion and compassion.

128
00:11:21,060 --> 00:11:24,520
If it is only in the phenomenon world that we are distinguished as individuals,

129
00:11:24,520 --> 00:11:28,540
It follows that your suffering is in fact as much my suffering.

130
00:11:29,140 --> 00:11:33,500
But the pity will soon understand the meaningless in his actions.

131
00:11:33,820 --> 00:11:38,940
The suffering is a consequence of the will, and everything is manifestations of this.

132
00:11:39,380 --> 00:11:43,080
As long as the world exists, suffering will exist.

133
00:11:43,320 --> 00:11:50,860
With the realization that suffering cannot be fought, a growing hatred comes to the will, and thus against the world itself.

134
00:11:51,280 --> 00:11:56,040
This leads to an active distance from the world, asceticism,

135
00:11:56,040 --> 00:12:00.560
by purposefully combating and destroying one's own willingness to life.

136
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:05,000
The first step is to distance themselves from all sexual drives.

137
00:12:05,380 --> 00:12:13,960
Thereafter, one must fight all other drives and desires in life and take an attitude of indifference to everything.

138
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:21,280
For those who remain in the claws of the will, the ash - who have expelled their inner will - will appear as empty.

139
00:12:21,420 --> 00:12:28,400
But for the ash itself, who has seen the true nature of the will, it is the life that is empty and meaningless.

140
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:35,160
The ash state of mind only appears empty as it exceeds our understanding.

141
00:12:35,560 --> 00:12:38,880
To understand this state of mind, one must, according to Schopenhauer,

142
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:43,700
Leave the domain of philosophy and continue into mysticism.
