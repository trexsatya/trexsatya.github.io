1
00:00:09,921 --> 00:00:16,240
But then there are people around Sweden who put down their entire lives to prepare for disasters

2
00:00:16,600 --> 00:00:20,600
They build bunkers, they collect preserves and they fill weapons cabinets.

3
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:25,600
These people are called preppers and it is precisely them this section should be about.

4
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:28,600
Are they madmen or do we have something to learn?

5
00:00:28,600 --> 00:00:31,600
And what are the disasters they think are we facing?

6
00:00:31,600 --> 00:00:35,600
You will meet three people in the form of a top list.

7
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:39,600
We will start with an extremely knowledgeable hobby type to learn more.

8
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:44,600
Then we will meet the leader for a secret prepper organization in Småland.

9
00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:48,600
And then we will end at Sweden's perhaps most prepared prepper-

10
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:54,600
-which completely left the community and now live full-time in its evacuation housing-

11
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:57,440
-To secret place in deepest north country.

12
00:00:57,440 --> 00:01:02,240
But this trip starts in Nynäshamn at our first prepper at level 1.

13
00:01:02,240 --> 00:01:07,760
- Because out here lives a guy who many of you may recognize, namely Kalle Zackari-Whalström.

14
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:09,760
No but!

15
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:11,760
He is!

16
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:17,080
Hehehe, what an aggressive entrance!

17
00:01:17,080 --> 00:01:19,600
There we could have ironed out.

18
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:20,920
- No, but I was in control.

19
00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:23,680
- Did you have control?
 Are you sure you were in control?

20
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:25,220
- I am fixing firewood.

21
00:01:25,220 --> 00:01:26,740
You can bring wood home with you if you want.

22
00:01:26,740 --> 00:01:29,140
This is more worth more than gold nowadays.

23
00:01:29,140 --> 00:01:30,140
- Scream ... oh.

24
00:01:37,460 --> 00:01:41,940
- My trip into the prepping, it was that I lived into town and longed for the country.

25
00:01:41,940 --> 00:01:42,440
- Yes.

26
00:01:42,440 --> 00:01:47,300
-And I started to listen to a podcast with an old man in Texas who is preparing.

27
00:01:47,300 --> 00:01:50,100
Now he has become a little sick in his head I think, so I stopped listening to him.

28
00:01:50,100 --> 00:01:52,220
So he has been radicalized, I think.

29
00:01:52,220 --> 00:01:54,220
- But that is a trip you are also out on.

30
00:01:54,220 --> 00:01:55,500
- Yes maybe.

31
00:01:55,500 --> 00:01:58,220
- You get a little psychic from living like this, it is.

32
00:01:58,220 --> 00:02:00,700
So this is my type of readiness.

33
00:02:00,700 --> 00:02:04,180
It was just having an ordinary life in the countryside 50 years ago.

34
00:02:04,180 --> 00:02:07,100
It is not me who has become strange, it is society that has become strange.

35
00:02:08,820 --> 00:02:10,100
- Can you go with?

36
00:02:10,100 --> 00:02:11,100
- Yes, come, come!

37
00:02:14,780 --> 00:02:15,620
- Surely it is wonderful?

38
00:02:15,620 --> 00:02:16,620
- Like hell!

39
00:02:16,620 --> 00:02:25,620
Here you have celebrity Sweden's biggest prepper, Kalle Zackari Wahlström, who will help us understand the phenomenon a little better.

40
00:02:25,620 --> 00:02:27,620
- What is a prepper?

41
00:02:27,620 --> 00:02:34,620
- One prepper is that you are interested in preparing for different eventualities.

42
00:02:34,620 --> 00:02:35,620
- What are they afraid of?

43
00:02:35,620 --> 00:02:37,620
- You can imagine a more dangerous pandemic.

44
00:02:37,620 --> 00:02:43,620
And then war feels like a scary thing going on in the world.

45
00:02:43,620 --> 00:02:44,620
- Yes.

46
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:47,420
How dedicated prepper are you?

47
00:02:47,420 --> 00:02:50,420
- So we have protective masks for everyone in the family in case it would be nuclear war

48
00:02:50,420 --> 00:02:53,620
An operating kit from the Swedish defense that we have bought.

49
00:02:53,620 --> 00:02:55,620
If we had to operate someone.

50
00:02:56,120 --> 00:02:58,320
I have so that we can do well here.

51
00:02:58,320 --> 00:03:01,620
MSB has gone out and said like this, everyone must have food for a week at home, one or two.

52
00:03:01,620 --> 00:03:04,220
And so it is type 28 percent who have it or something.

53
00:03:04,220 --> 00:03:05,620
What the hell is that?

54
00:03:05,620 --> 00:03:07,120
Do you have food and water for a week at home?

55
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:08,820
- No.

56
00:03:08,820 --> 00:03:11,420
- You should help others, you should not be a load.

57
00:03:11,420 --> 00:03:12,120
- Yes.

58
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:17,400
- Then the state should focus on taking care of weak, sick, old children.

59
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:19,400
Make sure they get food and water.

60
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:22,120
Instead, oh no, Mauri, the TV celebrity.

61
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:26,200
We have to give him, fast.
 He must have Ramlösa!

62
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:28,200
He does not drink plain water.

63
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:33,160
It's like you have failed all these who are looking now.

64
00:03:33,160 --> 00:03:35,160
- Have I?

65
00:03:35,160 --> 00:03:37,160
By not being prepared?

66
00:03:37,160 --> 00:03:39,160
- Shit in it.
 Should we go and look at the hens?

67
00:03:39,628 --> 00:03:40,263
- Okay

68
00:03:40,263 --> 00:03:40,925
- Ah came

69
00:03:43,373 --> 00:03:45,060
- So there are quite a few pancakes that you can fry by these

70
00:03:49,160 --> 00:03:51,160
- You just go.
 You have such a natural pondus.

71
00:03:51,160 --> 00:03:55,160
Now talk to them.
 You are like your own being.

72
00:03:55,160 --> 00:03:57,160
As one cannot control and control.

73
00:03:57,160 --> 00:03:59,160
What do you have in here?

74
00:03:59,160 --> 00:04:01,160
- Here I have meat.

75
00:04:01,160 --> 00:04:03,160
- Oh damn what a lot of meat you have.

76
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:06,160
I think this thing with prepping is like this ...

77
00:04:06,160 --> 00:04:08,160
It gets so big.

78
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:10,160
It can also just be like this.

79
00:04:10,160 --> 00:04:12,160
That I have some flour.

80
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:14,160
There are just a few extra weekly documents.

81
00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:16,160
So do you have it at home late

82
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:19,160
- You could survive in a war out here for five years.

83
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:21,160
- Yes.

84
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:23,160
Yes, I would.

85
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:25,160
- I am impressed.

86
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:27,160
- How cute you are, please.

87
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:29,160
- I think you're cruel.

88
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:31,160
- You have no small children.

89
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:33,160
You live alone.

90
00:04:33,160 --> 00:04:35,160
You have a pretty bold salary.

91
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:38,440
You have the way to control your preparedness.

92
00:04:38,440 --> 00:04:40,920
So you haven't done it in just ... it's laziness.

93
00:04:40,920 --> 00:04:43,920
I think it's so damn tragic just.
 I think it's tragic.

94
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:48,954
Hahahaha

95
00:04:49,160 --> 00:04:50,920
- What is the fucking tone?

96
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:54,120
- Here I have made snus.
 That is why it looks like this.

97
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:57,320
- Wait so ... in a possible crisis you wouldn't even have to buy snuff.

98
00:04:57,320 --> 00:04:58,900
- We move on, come!

99
00:04:59,084 --> 00:05:00,680
This is tobacco.
 So this will be snus then.

100
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:02,040
We move on, come.

101
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:04,000
- Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.
 Yes Yes.

102
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,000
Where are we going now?

103
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,440
- We may say goodbye to the kisses.

104
00:05:06,440 --> 00:05:08,440
- In what way is this good for a prepper?

105
00:05:08,440 --> 00:05:11,080
- So it's half a ton of meat that goes around here.

106
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:12,300
Come.

107
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:14,680
- It's such a speed on you.

108
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:16,320
- How do I go?
 Shows here how I go.

109
00:05:17,960 --> 00:05:18,960
- So you go.

110
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:20,960
So it's yours ... it's your walking style.

111
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:21,460
- Yes.

112
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,320
Here you can see my secret prepping weapon.

113
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:24,820
- huh?

114
00:05:24,820 --> 00:05:28,120
- 2.5 tonnes of wheat.
 That's what I can do for quite some time.

115
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:30,320
- How 2.5 tons of wheat?

116
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:30,820
- Yes.

117
00:05:30,820 --> 00:05:31,320
I think so

118
00:05:31,320 --> 00:05:36,460
It is like bread or porridge or overnight oats maybe.

119
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:38,520
- It doesn't feel like a crisis.

120
00:05:38,520 --> 00:05:39,480
- No no.

121
00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:40,120
- But that's ...

122
00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:41,640
- No, but we must say porridge is a crisis.

123
00:05:41,640 --> 00:05:43,080
- Porridge is crisis.

124
00:05:44,480 --> 00:05:45,480
- Now let's go to the cellar.

125
00:05:45,480 --> 00:05:46,240
- The cellar?

126
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:46,740
- Yes.

127
00:05:46,740 --> 00:05:48,580
- This is a lot of water cans.

128
00:05:48,580 --> 00:05:53,360
- Water is what goes on the ass first for people in crisis.

129
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:53,860
Come.

130
00:05:57,020 --> 00:05:57,520
- Oh.

131
00:05:57,520 --> 00:05:58,480
- This is what they look like.

132
00:05:58,480 --> 00:06:04,280
- So if there are nuclear weapons or something, then can these help you?

133
00:06:04,360 --> 00:06:08,840
- 15 years ago Sweden had protective masks for all citizens.

134
00:06:08,920 --> 00:06:14,200
Then there was someone who said "ah it calmly", and then they just fired up the masks, so now there are no longer.

135
00:06:14,280 --> 00:06:16,560
- Was it so smart?

136
00:06:16,640 --> 00:06:21,240
From the 1940s onwards, Sweden built a world-class civilian defense.

137
00:06:21,320 --> 00:06:25,640
There was plenty of food, protective equipment and medicines in the event of crisis.

138
00:06:25,640 --> 00:06:31,400
There were even 7.3 million protective masks, one for each citizen.

139
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:34,320
But during the 1990s everything was dismantled.

140
00:06:34,320 --> 00:06:39,960
Warehouses and shelters were bombed again and millions of protective masks were burned up.

141
00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:44,200
But in recent years, Sweden has begun to rebuild its civil defense.

142
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:47,120
- You look pretty cool.
 - Yes actually.

143
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:49,800
- A little sexy.
 Is it?
 - Yes, quite.

144
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:53,000
That I lie inside the bedroom and you will enter just the gas mask.

145
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,040
It's still tickling

146
00:06:54,040 --> 00:06:55,840
- Oh damn!

147
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:56,840
What would it look like?

148
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:12,120
- Do you want coffee or?

149
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:13,600
- Yes please.

150
00:07:14,320 --> 00:07:15,160
It also feels.

151
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:17,480
2023 It is a war in Europe.

152
00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:19,640
We have just come out of a pandemic.

153
00:07:19,640 --> 00:07:21,160
There is talk of electricity shortages.

154
00:07:21,160 --> 00:07:27,200
You know, you are a little stupid in your head if you do not take responsibility for your crisis preparedness.

155
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:29,800
- But are you a little crazy bunch?

156
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:34,440
- There are absolutely crazy preppers.

157
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:36,440
- Do you have weapons?

158
00:07:36,440 --> 00:07:37,200
- Yes I have.

159
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:40,240
- And then you are not shy to use in a crisis if someone comes here?

160
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:45,600
- Well, I would be, I would be very shy to shoot someone, I think.

161
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:51,200
I would think about once and twice before I actually killed someone with my rifle.

162
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:53,360
- But then you shoot.

163
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:58,520
- So, three quick thoughts.
 Then it slams.

164
00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:06,200
- Where do you think we will end up on this trip as we get deeper into the core of the prepping?

165
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:10,040
- You will surely think people exaggerate.

166
00:08:10,040 --> 00:08:16,960
Instead, try to have an open sin and think like this, they do what takes responsibility for themselves and their family.

167
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:20,960
If something happens, then the preppers will be kings.

168
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:24,360
So tighten you, now it gets off.

169
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:25,360
- Yes.

170
00:08:27,480 --> 00:08:29,280
Yes, now we raise it another snap.

171
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:35,960
Because before you get to meet Sweden's most prepared prepper, we will go to the border between Småland and Blekinge.

172
00:08:35,960 --> 00:08:41,160
Here has been a man who has been the leader for a fairly light shaded prepper organization for several years.

173
00:08:41,160 --> 00:08:44,600
And his greatest passion in life is crisis preparedness.

174
00:08:45,840 --> 00:08:46,720
- And here ...

175
00:08:47,480 --> 00:08:49,120
... then this man lives.

176
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:52,400
And I guess I simply have to tap.

177
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:56,200
- Hello?

178
00:08:56,200 --> 00:08:56,720
- Hello!

179
00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:57,480
- Mauri

180
00:08:57,480 --> 00:08:58,480
- Reidar

181
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:13,480
- I immediately note TV and video surveillance.

182
00:09:13,480 --> 00:09:15,480
- Yes, it started with it being for the prepping.

183
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:19,480
Plus I have had some worries with Practical Jokes.

184
00:09:19,480 --> 00:09:20,480
- Okay.

185
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:25,480
- Among other things, a friend here who came here and put where you have your car.

186
00:09:25,480 --> 00:09:27,480
A stone of 2 tons.

187
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:29,480
- But what kind of friend?

188
00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:31,480
- I wonder that too.

189
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:34,480
- Would you be able to walk around and have a look at all the prepping details?

190
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:37,480
- I have stuffed a bit like this.

191
00:09:37,480 --> 00:09:39,480
It is not really legal to hold.

192
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:41,480
So to speak.

193
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:43,480
- So we can't see it then?

194
00:09:43,480 --> 00:09:45,480
No, but there is something else.

195
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:47,480
Here I have picked up some stuff from a prepping place we have.

196
00:09:47,480 --> 00:09:49,480
- A bear trap?

197
00:09:49,480 --> 00:09:51,480
- We'll see if we can rig one here.

198
00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:53,480
- Yes, just gently.

199
00:09:56,288 --> 00:09:57,480
- Good to have.

200
00:09:57,480 --> 00:10:01,480
- I think the state has more secrets than we would like to know.

201
00:10:01,480 --> 00:10:07,480
As in the US, you have area 51, which is a prepper we have talked to a lot in the US.

202
00:10:07,480 --> 00:10:13,480
He is determined, for example, that Bigfoot exists and that the state knows it.

203
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:18,480
But there are secrets within the state.
 Absolutely.

204
00:10:20,316 --> 00:10:21,480
Then I have a harpoon too

205
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:24,760
There are also a couple of old people bought in a market that I was going to renovate.

206
00:10:24,760 --> 00:10:28,400
- Here you have a harpoon.
 But God, it is too damn charged Reidar

207
00:10:28,940 --> 00:10:30,680
Oh, can you have this kind of thing?

208
00:10:30,680 --> 00:10:31,583
- No clue

209
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:33,200
May be good to have.

210
00:10:33,520 --> 00:10:35,680
- May be good to have in a crisis.

211
00:10:36,520 --> 00:10:39,100
- I talk about pigs.
 Tell it to him in there.

212
00:10:39,100 --> 00:10:40,400
- Is he a pig?

213
00:10:40,400 --> 00:10:41,720
- No, I have a pig in there.

214
00:10:41,720 --> 00:10:43,180
- huh?
 Inside the house?

215
00:10:43,180 --> 00:10:43,720
- Yes

216
00:10:43,720 --> 00:10:47,680
- No!
 It's a pig!
 What are you doing here?

217
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:49,680
What is it called?
 Ludvig.

218
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:51,680
Hi Ludvig

219
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:54,680
- I won he at a competition on Facebook.

220
00:10:54,680 --> 00:10:56,680
- He doesn't bite, right?

221
00:10:56,680 --> 00:10:58,680
- ehhhhh ... both yes and no.

222
00:10:58,680 --> 00:10:59,680
- Both yes and no?

223
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:02,680
- But you are a man with many surprises Reidar.

224
00:11:02,680 --> 00:11:04,680
It feels like you have at least one more messy thing.

225
00:11:04,680 --> 00:11:07,680
- Yes, it would be the home building over there.

226
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:09,680
- This is your Bug Out Vehicle.

227
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:12,680
So what you use if you have to escape in a crisis situation.

228
00:11:12,680 --> 00:11:15,680
- Exactly.
 Each group will have one to two vehicles each.

229
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:20,280
We will have about food for 9-12 months with us.

230
00:11:20,360 --> 00:11:24,240
This one in our community will be a communication car.

231
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:26,640
So it will have a comradio.

232
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:29,400
It should have a much larger battery system in itself.

233
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:30,720
I got it for 3,000.

234
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:32,880
- There is your wife.

235
00:11:32,960 --> 00:11:34,000
- Hello!

236
00:11:34,080 --> 00:11:38,280
- What is it like to be the wife of such a dedicated prepper?

237
00:11:38,360 --> 00:11:40,480
- You have quite a great patience with a prepper.

238
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:43,240
I try to keep him in control anyway.

239
00:11:43,240 --> 00:11:44,960
- You try?
 -I try to.

240
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:47,080
- How much are you talking about this with your wife?

241
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:49,560
- It is as soon as possible.

242
00:11:49,720 --> 00:11:52,640
I think she is getting tired of me now.

243
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:56,680
- The first time you Reidar met, how fast did it take before he started talking about prepping?

244
00:11:56,840 --> 00:11:59,800
- We sat non stop and talked for two to three hours.

245
00:11:59,960 --> 00:12:02,680
-If?
 - If prepping.

246
00:12:02,840 --> 00:12:06,840
- Oh!
 Have you told me everything you have for me?

247
00:12:11,195 --> 00:12:15,195
- Some things are safest not to know.

248
00:12:15,311 --> 00:12:18,311
But where are they unknown, hidden things?

249
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:22,800
They are scattered each and all around the country.

250
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:27,827
Huh?
 You have as a group of prepper for which you are partly the leader.

251
00:12:27,840 --> 00:12:29,040
How many are you?

252
00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:40,760
For several years now, this group of families have jointly planned escape routes, scouted hiding places and bought equipment.

253
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:44,560
They even have a secret mountain bunker in Northern Norway.

254
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:49,160
Right now, this group will have a meeting.
 We should keep up.

255
00:12:49,160 --> 00:12:53,080
- There are some who have grunted a little for me to sit and film.

256
00:12:53,080 --> 00:12:55,560
They are a bit skeptical of the media you can say.

257
00:12:55,560 --> 00:12:57,640
- Yes, you can really say that.

258
00:12:57,640 --> 00:12:59,640
- But is it just to wait for them?

259
00:12:59,640 --> 00:13:02,360
- Yes.
 Then we take coffee for so long.

260
00:13:02,360 --> 00:13:06,360
- Can you tell the camera how much coffee you drink every day?

261
00:13:06,520 --> 00:13:08,120
- Three to four such a day.

262
00:13:08,280 --> 00:13:09,840
- It's too much, Reidar.

263
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,520
- No, I'm just feeling it.

264
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:16,200
Then the guests began to roll in from different parts of Småland.

265
00:13:16,360 --> 00:13:21,600
An incredibly diverse crowd of people who all snow in on Prepping.

266
00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:26,720
- Yes, welcome then.
 We have received some complications.

267
00:13:32,119 --> 00:13:36,720
Route 2 is gone.
 I have found a suitable place there.

268
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:38,720
- Yes, up there yes.

269
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:40,720
- What will you do in this place?

270
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:46,720
- There we gather all vehicles, all our preppersaker and camp.

271
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:53,720
These crosses.
 These are places that we know there are military barracks.

272
00:13:53,720 --> 00:13:55,720
- Is this all military bases?

273
00:13:55,720 --> 00:13:57,720
- As we have found so far.

274
00:13:57,720 --> 00:13:58,720
- What's that?

275
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:01,720
- This is a regular inventory list now when we order.

276
00:14:01,720 --> 00:14:06,720
These think we are a restaurant.

277
00:14:09,720 --> 00:14:12,720
There I sat and was impressed by their dedication.

278
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:17,720
These people on the outskirts of society who perhaps most of all just want a project.

279
00:14:17,720 --> 00:14:21,720
While the meeting ended, I took a walk with Ludvig.

280
00:14:21,720 --> 00:14:24,720
- There is something with Reidar because his passion ..

281
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:28,720
He must be the most passionate we have when it comes to preppers.

282
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:31,720
- But how do you eat an ordinary day?

283
00:14:31,720 --> 00:14:35,720
- Yes, an ordinary day consists of different types of food that are available.

284
00:14:35,720 --> 00:14:40,720
Now we have consumed everything.
 This is what we have left of the prepper supply itself.

285
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:42,720
- Why have you consumed it?

286
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:45,720
- Due to food prices and electricity prices right now.

287
00:14:45,720 --> 00:14:48,720
- So you have had to eat your prepper food store like?

288
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:52,720
- Yes, right now in this crisis situation we have had here now I have done it.

289
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:54,720
But we have not traded food in seven months.

290
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:59,720
- It has to pain somewhere for a prepper to have to eat up its storage room.

291
00:14:59,720 --> 00:15:01,720
- Yes that...

292
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:04,720
Yes, it stings.
 It does.

293
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:07,720
- The dream right now is to rebuild the store.

294
00:15:07,720 --> 00:15:12,720
- Oh yes, that's it.
 Because it is as they say, if you are at the bottom, there is only one way.

295
00:15:13,720 --> 00:15:14,720
And that's up.

296
00:15:15,720 --> 00:15:18,720
- But I think we can cook a lunch then, as you usually cook it?

297
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:21,720
- White prayers and old honest goulash soup.

298
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:33,720
- Now Reidar has not talked about prepping in three seconds.

299
00:15:33,720 --> 00:15:35,720
- It's a record!

300
00:15:35,720 --> 00:15:36,720
- New record.

301
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:37,720
- Is it a new record?

302
00:15:37,720 --> 00:15:38,720
- Almost.

303
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:41,720
- An applause to Reidar.
 Three seconds.

304
00:15:41,720 --> 00:15:43,720
- Then I get more time to think.

305
00:15:43,720 --> 00:15:44,720
- On what?

306
00:15:47,132 --> 00:15:49,132
- Prepping.

307
00:15:49,716 --> 00:15:52,796
It's not so bad food to live on.

308
00:15:52,840 --> 00:15:54,720
- I thought this was delicious.

309
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:58,896
- Everything you can eat, only they are the right spices or some good accessories.

310
00:15:59,336 --> 00:16:00,904
- Yes, is the situation as it is so.

311
00:16:00,904 --> 00:16:03,680
Because Nina and Reidar's situration look like it does-

312
00:16:03,720 --> 00:16:06,480
- I felt there was one last thing I wanted to do.

313
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:10,024
- Due to the economy and your prepper store-

314
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:12,920
So I thought I would invite you to a surprise.

315
00:16:13,080 --> 00:16:14,080
- Okay.

316
00:16:17,520 --> 00:16:19,520
Oh Lord, Jösses!

317
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:22,920
- Oh, but God.

318
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:25,600
No, but so God.

319
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:28,000
- Come here with you.

320
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:34,200
It feels like now we are able to ride out the storm a little longer.

321
00:16:34,360 --> 00:16:36,960
The first time someone does this for my sake.

322
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:38,120
- Is that so?

323
00:16:38,280 --> 00:16:39,960
- I don't know what to say.

324
00:16:39,960 --> 00:16:46,000
- I also thought of Ludvig.
 I would like to give a really cheerful pizza to Ludvig.

325
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:52,080
This is just for you, Ludvig.

326
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:55,040
Short break for pictures of Ludvig when he was little.

327
00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:07,840
When we are still on the move, we say hello to wonderful Reidar and Nina.

328
00:17:07,840 --> 00:17:10,920
- But before we visit our last guest, you wonder ...

329
00:17:10,920 --> 00:17:12,680
We who have not prepared ourselves at all.

330
00:17:12,680 --> 00:17:15,760
What can we do to be sure if the crisis comes?

331
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:19,120
Therefore, I have invited the survival expert ...

332
00:17:19,120 --> 00:17:21,120
... Martin Svennberg!

333
00:17:32,600 --> 00:17:33,600
- Can we release now?

334
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:34,920
- Yes absolutely.

335
00:17:34,920 --> 00:17:36,160
What are you looking for?

336
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:40,720
- In a shorter but intense crisis, it is most important to have water and heat.

337
00:17:40,800 --> 00:17:42,600
You have a little plaid.

338
00:17:42,680 --> 00:17:43,960
- But this is.
 Plus points?

339
00:17:44,040 --> 00:17:47,840
- Yes, not many, but a bit anyway.

340
00:17:47,920 --> 00:17:50,760
- Here I have sunscreen.
 I have a lot of that.

341
00:17:50,840 --> 00:17:51,968
There I am well -spread.

342
00:17:51,968 --> 00:17:52,840
- Yes but that's good

343
00:17:52,840 --> 00:17:54,880
- Are you a little proud of me?

344
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:58,080
- That you are the only one who has sun protection 50 in March.

345
00:17:58,160 --> 00:18:00,320
It's pretty cool indeed.

346
00:18:01,640 --> 00:18:04,400
- Now it gets a little exciting.

347
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:07,200
No, but February 20 this went out.

348
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:10,720
It contains no one nourish your fridge.

349
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:14,280
So this is not really good.

350
00:18:14,440 --> 00:18:15,320
Ten ice cubes.

351
00:18:15,480 --> 00:18:17,240
- How long should I survive in a crisis?

352
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:19,520
- Three days.
 But then you haven't eaten anything.

353
00:18:19,680 --> 00:18:21,880
So then you will be a sad person too.

354
00:18:22,040 --> 00:18:25,840
- I'll die and I'll die sad after three days.

355
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:29,760
Then you wonder what the most important things to have at home?

356
00:18:29,920 --> 00:18:32,400
- This is number three.
 This is a crank radio.

357
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:37,000
- With just this one can always get updates on the situation in the country.

358
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:38,440
- Number two.

359
00:18:38,440 --> 00:18:39,920
- Gaspis.

360
00:18:39,920 --> 00:18:42,880
- To boil water is the easiest way to clean water.

361
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:44,640
- But this one can also have to heat food.

362
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:47,760
For example, if you want to heat your tuna.

363
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:50,800
- What is the scornful tone?

364
00:18:50,800 --> 00:18:53,600
- Number one.
 Just dealing with water exclusively.

365
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:55,960
For three days without water, do we manage?

366
00:18:55,960 --> 00:18:57,160
- Not on...?

367
00:18:57,160 --> 00:18:58,720
- Not on.

368
00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:01,000
Hello.

369
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:04,520
Return up to the trip to Norrland and our last visit.

370
00:19:04,520 --> 00:19:08,760
His name is Andreas and is Sweden's biggest name in prepping.

371
00:19:08,760 --> 00:19:14,760
- When it comes to the modern Swedish balanced prepping, you could call him the Urap.

372
00:19:14,760 --> 00:19:19,560
For several years he blogged under the name Urvaken and even appeared in the media.

373
00:19:19,560 --> 00:19:25,320
But a year and a half ago, he suddenly put the blog down and disappeared completely from social media.

374
00:19:25,320 --> 00:19:31,440
- Andreas went from being the wound to just disappearing all of a sudden.

375
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:35,040
- He may have gone completely off-grid.

376
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:39,240
What happened was that Andreas moved out permanently to his evacuation home.

377
00:19:39,400 --> 00:19:43,880
Since then not a squat.
 And no thanks to all kinds of media.

378
00:19:44,040 --> 00:19:48,800
- I tried to do TV shows about prepping.
 I tried to contact mass preppers, including then the ancestry

379
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:53,520
Could not get hold of him.
 So you have managed to fix it, it is damn powerful then.

380
00:19:53,520 --> 00:20:00,280
Hour after hour by car towards deepest Norrland with a promise not to state his coordinates in the program.

381
00:20:00,280 --> 00:20:03,400
- Type here, like all civilization, ends.

382
00:20:03,400 --> 00:20:07,760
Deep in that forest he lives completely alone.

383
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:16,520
It is completely impossible to get here by car.
 You have to walk the last kilometers as well.

384
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:19,000
Is this where he lives?

385
00:20:19,400 --> 00:20:20,920
This is where he lives.

386
00:20:20,920 --> 00:20:22,920
Listen how quiet it is.

387
00:20:24,800 --> 00:20:26,800
Absolutely silent.

388
00:20:36,040 --> 00:20:38,840
- Hello!
 Hey!

389
00:20:38,840 --> 00:20:39,840
- Mauri!

390
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:40,840
- Andreas!

391
00:20:48,507 --> 00:20:52,507
It feels like you have made prepping a lifestyle in a way that not everyone has done.

392
00:20:52,687 --> 00:20:56,687
- Yes, that's how I have chosen to live my life.

393
00:21:04,647 --> 00:21:06,647
- Should we have a little look at how you live here?

394
00:21:07,007 --> 00:21:07,507
- Can we do.

395
00:21:07,507 --> 00:21:08,609
- What is this?

396
00:21:08,840 --> 00:21:13,064
It's a simple greenhouse to extend the season so I grow in these.

397
00:21:13,064 --> 00:21:15,608
- Solar cells are located there to be installed.

398
00:21:15,728 --> 00:21:16,840
- And what is it in the freezer there?

399
00:21:16,840 --> 00:21:17,840
- If you open, you will see.

400
00:21:20,340 --> 00:21:21,340
- What is this?

401
00:21:21,340 --> 00:21:25,340
- It's rice, macaroni, salt and sugar.
 It's all possible there.

402
00:21:25,340 --> 00:21:26,340
- No!

403
00:21:26,340 --> 00:21:27,340
- No!

404
00:21:27,340 --> 00:21:30,340
- I'm pretty introverted really.

405
00:21:30,340 --> 00:21:32,840
That is what people have very difficult.

406
00:21:32,840 --> 00:21:37,340
My mother is very difficult to compare that I live here myself.

407
00:21:37,340 --> 00:21:40,180
How can you live like that?
 Aren't you alone?

408
00:21:40,260 --> 00:21:42,180
Although I don't think so.

409
00:21:42,260 --> 00:21:45,580
- How many years would you survive on all the food you have out here?

410
00:21:45,660 --> 00:21:47,580
- If I'm myself, I would say four years.

411
00:21:47,660 --> 00:21:49,300
- You have four years of food here.

412
00:21:49,380 --> 00:21:51,660
- But I won't be myself, so ...

413
00:21:52,620 --> 00:21:54,380
- Are I invited?
 -No.

414
00:21:54,460 --> 00:21:56,580
- I'm not invited?
 -No.

415
00:21:56,660 --> 00:21:58,140
- Thanks anyway.

416
00:21:58,220 --> 00:22:00,860
Why can't I come along and come here?

417
00:22:00,940 --> 00:22:02,980
What is a bad style?

418
00:22:03,060 --> 00:22:06,860
- I saw that a scooter is here.
 Can I go scooter?

419
00:22:06,860 --> 00:22:08,860
- You don't know that even you have tried.

420
00:22:08,860 --> 00:22:10,860
- No.

421
00:22:11,796 --> 00:22:13,120
Wohohooo!

422
00:22:26,860 --> 00:22:28,860
- And it's in here that you live?

423
00:22:28,860 --> 00:22:30,860
- Here I live, for real.

424
00:22:30,860 --> 00:22:33,860
If you need to escape, so to speak, then you live wrong.

425
00:22:36,236 --> 00:22:38,236
- Do you think some crap will happen?

426
00:22:38,760 --> 00:22:40,452
- We have just undergone a pandemic.

427
00:22:40,452 --> 00:22:40,984
- Yes.

428
00:22:40,984 --> 00:22:41,976
- And now we have a war in Europe again.

429
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:43,000
- mm.

430
00:22:44,956 --> 00:22:48,956
-But you are absolutely sure that some crap will happen within 10-20-30 years?

431
00:22:48,992 --> 00:22:49,992
- Absolutely.

432
00:22:49,992 --> 00:22:51,992
- What is the most likely disaster?

433
00:22:51,992 --> 00:22:52,992
According to you?

434
00:22:52,992 --> 00:22:54,720
- A solar storm.

435
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:55,704
- huh?

436
00:22:56,244 --> 00:22:57,344
Hello?

437
00:22:57,848 --> 00:23:01,848
- A solar storm is really when you get an outbreak on the sun.

438
00:23:01,860 --> 00:23:04,500
And these bikes return by about 120 years.

439
00:23:04,940 --> 00:23:06,460
- When did we have a solar storm last?

440
00:23:06,460 --> 00:23:10,620
- Yes, about 120 years ago we had something called the Carrington event.

441
00:23:10,620 --> 00:23:13,020
At that time there was not so much electronics in the world.

442
00:23:13,020 --> 00:23:14,060
There were telegraphs.

443
00:23:14,060 --> 00:23:19,460
And those telegraphs started to burn, for example because there was so much electrical charge in them.

444
00:23:19,460 --> 00:23:24,380
- So there will probably be a solar storm soon that beats out half the world's technology?

445
00:23:24,380 --> 00:23:25,500
- Yes.

446
00:23:25,500 --> 00:23:26,220
Yes, and it's like ...

447
00:23:26,220 --> 00:23:29,060
- It was boring news to me.

448
00:23:29,060 --> 00:23:32,500
But you see all the small prepper details everywhere.

449
00:23:32,500 --> 00:23:35,820
- Yes, there is food everywhere.

450
00:23:35,820 --> 00:23:36,900
- And what's in here?

451
00:23:36,900 --> 00:23:37,900
- Here is the toilet.

452
00:23:38,580 --> 00:23:42,540
And since there is no drain and no water, it will be toilet afterwards.

453
00:23:42,540 --> 00:23:44,420
- It doesn't smell midsummer in here.

454
00:23:44,420 --> 00:23:45,140
- Don't it?

455
00:23:45,140 --> 00:23:45,780
- No.

456
00:23:45,780 --> 00:23:50,100
- I sacrifice a lot of things by choosing to live like this.

457
00:23:50,780 --> 00:23:56,780
I could almost say that I could be prepared to kill for a hot shower sometimes.

458
00:23:56,780 --> 00:24:01,780
- And there is just one machete type.
 Should I be scared?

459
00:24:01,780 --> 00:24:06,780
- No.
 If you are not going to be invited like that.

460
00:24:06,780 --> 00:24:08,780
- But I'm invited here.

461
00:24:08,780 --> 00:24:11,780
- We have discussed this so many times you and I now.

462
00:24:11,780 --> 00:24:16,780
It is like a private party where the word private is very with big letters so.

463
00:24:16,780 --> 00:24:19,780
- Yes, private.
 Not everyone can come.

464
00:24:19,780 --> 00:24:22,780
- I may have to be clearer with my no.

465
00:24:22,780 --> 00:24:23,780
- Yes, may I come?

466
00:24:23,780 --> 00:24:24,780
- No.

467
00:24:24,780 --> 00:24:27,540
- Yes, it's ... because now you flash, I think.

468
00:24:27,540 --> 00:24:30,380
- This one is a little fun.
 It is to measure radioactivity.

469
00:24:30,380 --> 00:24:31,060
- Yes.

470
00:24:31,060 --> 00:24:33,180
- That's if there were atomic bombs, kind of.

471
00:24:33,180 --> 00:24:33,940
- Yep.

472
00:24:33,940 --> 00:24:35,100
- What is it up to?

473
00:24:35,100 --> 00:24:39,100
- It's 0.10 millisievert.

474
00:24:39,100 --> 00:24:42,300
- 0.10 Millisievert?
 Who the hell is Siewert?
 Wondering then?

475
00:24:42,300 --> 00:24:43,660
- Yes, he is, Siewert Öholm.

476
00:24:43,660 --> 00:24:46,340
- What can you really joke about?

477
00:24:46,340 --> 00:24:48,140
- But Siewert Öholm is dead.

478
00:24:48,140 --> 00:24:50,220
Are we looking for Siewert Öholm's spirit then?

479
00:24:50,220 --> 00:24:53,900
- If you hear someone who starts whispering video violence and such things, then ...

480
00:24:53,900 --> 00:24:55,900
- It's 0.10 of him here.

481
00:24:55,900 --> 00:24:57,180
* whispers* violent society.

482
00:24:57,180 --> 00:24:59,180
* whispers* 19-year-old Satanist

483
00:25:00,300 --> 00:25:01,300
Siewert ...?

484
00:25:02,500 --> 00:25:05,180
- It's too little Siewert for him to answer.

485
00:25:05,540 --> 00:25:06,540
- It's too little.

486
00:25:06,540 --> 00:25:07,540
- Yep.

487
00:25:09,180 --> 00:25:10,580
- Very hot minutes.

488
00:25:10,940 --> 00:25:14,140
- It's hard not to note that you have walkie talkies there.

489
00:25:14,580 --> 00:25:16,980
It also feels a bit like madness.

490
00:25:17,300 --> 00:25:19,860
To have two such, ready.

491
00:25:20,060 --> 00:25:21,380
Like it could play tomorrow.

492
00:25:21,380 --> 00:25:22,700
Do you understand what I mean?

493
00:25:22,700 --> 00:25:25,020
- It's because it can actually hit tomorrow.

494
00:25:26,700 --> 00:25:27,700
- Yes.

495
00:25:29,180 --> 00:25:30,460
- What do you have in this cabinet?

496
00:25:30,460 --> 00:25:32,980
- I have hunting weapons and then I have silver.

497
00:25:32,980 --> 00:25:34,980
These are not affected by inflation.

498
00:25:34,980 --> 00:25:37,420
- How much are all these silver coins worth you think?

499
00:25:37,420 --> 00:25:41,580
- So a silver coin I would say is worth about SEK 300.

500
00:25:43,100 --> 00:25:45,100
So you keep it in a thousand or so there.

501
00:25:45,100 --> 00:25:49,500
- But wait then your silver coins are worth SEK 100,000, which is here.

502
00:25:49,500 --> 00:25:50,500
Oh God.

503
00:25:50,500 --> 00:25:54,500
You can't avoid having weapons here too.

504
00:25:54,500 --> 00:25:55,500
- Yep.

505
00:25:55,500 --> 00:25:58,500
- Look at yourself.
 You are ready.

506
00:25:58,500 --> 00:26:01,500
- I've been working on this for 15 years.
 It's just accelerating.

507
00:26:01,500 --> 00:26:03,500
- Yes.
 Against here.

508
00:26:03,500 --> 00:26:04,830
- Yes ..

509
00:26:04,830 --> 00:26:05,865
No!

510
00:26:06,500 --> 00:26:09,500
- It is a secret world in many ways prepping.

511
00:26:09,500 --> 00:26:12,500
Have you told us everything, everything you have?

512
00:26:12,500 --> 00:26:13,500
- No.

513
00:26:13,500 --> 00:26:17,500
- huh?
 But you have kind of hiding places.

514
00:26:17,500 --> 00:26:19,500
- Then I choose not to answer.

515
00:26:19,896 --> 00:26:22,500
- God, it's like a politician there, it's a little exciting.

516
00:26:24,516 --> 00:26:27,500
Do you have a little bunker?

517
00:26:31,500 --> 00:26:34,500
- Did you see any bunker when you have walked around here?

518
00:26:34,500 --> 00:26:38,500
- So, you are crazy in a good way.

519
00:26:38,500 --> 00:26:42,500
But what else do you have?
 Can you have?

520
00:26:44,500 --> 00:26:46,500
- And here you have even more food.

521
00:26:46,500 --> 00:26:50,500
How many kilos of food have you prepped totally?

522
00:26:50,500 --> 00:26:52,500
- I think I have an Excel file.

523
00:26:52,500 --> 00:26:55,562
- Can we develop an Excel file and look?

524
00:26:59,500 --> 00:27:02,500
823 kilos of food you have.

525
00:27:02,500 --> 00:27:04,500
Damn!

526
00:27:04,500 --> 00:27:07,500
And with that, maybe I thank you.

527
00:27:07,500 --> 00:27:10,500
- I thought you would say back to the studio.

528
00:27:10,500 --> 00:27:11,500
It would have been a little fun.

529
00:27:11,500 --> 00:27:12,500
- Why?

530
00:27:12,500 --> 00:27:15,500
- It would have been so fun.
 It would have been so clumsy in some way.

531
00:27:15,500 --> 00:27:17,500
- Thanks for today.

532
00:27:17,500 --> 00:27:18,380
- Thanks.

533
00:27:18,380 --> 00:27:19,780
- and back to the studio.

534
00:27:22,780 --> 00:27:23,780
- huh?

535
00:27:23,780 --> 00:27:25,380
- Yes, we are live.

536
00:27:25,380 --> 00:27:27,060
- What live?
 What do you mean?

537
00:27:27,060 --> 00:27:29,500
- Musty Mauri?
 He has handed over to the studio.

538
00:27:29,500 --> 00:27:32,220
- What?
 Has he handed over to our studio?

539
00:27:32,220 --> 00:27:33,700
How is it even possible?

540
00:27:34,580 --> 00:27:37,220
- Has Mauri handed over here?

541
00:27:37,220 --> 00:27:39,780
No, but then you have to go back to Youtube.

542
00:27:40,608 --> 00:27:41,780
- What the hell!

543
00:27:41,780 --> 00:27:43,780
- But what are you doing here?

544
00:27:43,780 --> 00:27:45,780
What the hell?
 Go away!

545
00:27:45,780 --> 00:27:46,808
This is not mission food!

546
00:27:46,808 --> 00:27:47,537
- Jonas calm you down.

547
00:27:47,780 --> 00:27:49,780
- I'm getting annoyed as hell!

548
00:27:49,780 --> 00:27:51,780
Drag!
 Go away!

549
00:27:51,780 --> 00:27:53,780
- Yes Yes.

550
00:27:53,780 --> 00:27:55,780
This was probably a little wrong.

551
00:27:55,780 --> 00:27:57,780
- The world's strongest pizza.

552
00:27:59,780 --> 00:28:01,780
- Mauri, wrong channel.

553
00:28:01,780 --> 00:28:03,780
This is food coma away.

554
00:28:03,780 --> 00:28:05,780
- Yes, then we were back on

555
00:28:05,780 --> 00:28:07,780
Youtube channel.
 A new day has Grytt in Norrland

556
00:28:07,780 --> 00:28:12,920
- And I felt yesterday there was like a question that hung a little in the air.

557
00:28:12,920 --> 00:28:16,600
Now I'll go and ask that question one last time.

558
00:29:07,352 --> 00:29:09,060
- But we have discussed that, no!

559
00:29:11,240 --> 00:29:12,760
- A hug?

560
00:29:13,080 --> 00:29:14,680
- You can get that.
