00:00:01,540 --> 00:00:09,140
"Why should we know this?" Say you maybe when the teacher pulls out some old text that was written hundreds of years ago.

2
00:00:09,140 --> 00:00:18,280
The question may initially seem reasonable, but you - even if it sounds strange - were not created when you were born.

3
00:00:18,520 --> 00:00:27,820
You were born into a world that has been shaped by people who have thought and thought things for thousands of years. It is very good.

4
00:00:28,020 --> 00:00:37,220
Therefore, every person who is born does not have to reinvent the wheel and mobile phone, or come from the ground up how to build houses or bake bread.

5
00:00:37,740 --> 00:00:44,340
It is already fixed. By reading old texts we gain an understanding of the world around us.

6
00:00:44,500 --> 00:00:50,040
We get smart fucking who knows things. Those you listen to.

7
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:57,760
Some call it general education. You can also see it as a way to avoid appearing as an idiot.

8
00:01:04,340 --> 00:01:12,420
Literature history is the story of how different texts have changed society and how society has changed the way we write texts.

9
00:01:13,700 --> 00:01:21,440
Thus, by learning about literary history, you automatically learn a lot about society and thus also about yourself.

10
00:01:21,980 --> 00:01:26,700
You become one of those smart bastards - a one you listen to.

11
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:34,640
The written language has not always existed. First, people just talked to each other and then they started writing down important things.

12
00:01:34,980 --> 00:01:43,000
It was pretty short things you wrote down. Name of a person who had died, how many horses you had or otherwise important to remember.

13
00:01:43,480 --> 00:01:49,320
The writing has, like the advantage that the words even live on after someone dies.

14
00:01:51,940 --> 00:02:01,760
After a while it developed there and texts became longer and longer. You started writing and reading texts to find out how other people think and what other people think about things.

15
00:02:01,960 --> 00:02:06,900
People finally started reading and writing without any other direct reason than it was fun.

16
00:02:07,080 --> 00:02:18,100
You realized that with reading it was so nice that you could call such texts that you just read for pleasure for "fiction".

17
00:02:30,920 --> 00:02:34,980
You can divide literary history into something called epoch.

18
00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:38,200
"Epoch" is about the same thing as time period.

19
00:02:38,380 --> 00:02:43,040
A man who lived in the eleven centuries lived during an era called the Middle Ages.

20
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:49,100
This they had no idea whatsoever that they did because it is a name that we have found afterwards.

21
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:54,680
A simple epoch for literary history looks much like this:
