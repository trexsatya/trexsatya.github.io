00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,760
Hey!

2
00:00:00,760 --> 00:00:03,640
Do you know what it's time for today?!

3
00:00:03,640 --> 00:00:07,780
It's time for an ALWAYS VLOG!

4
00:00:07,780 --> 00:00:10,940
This video is made in collaboration with Always.

5
00:00:10,940 --> 00:00:12,500
Pads, everybody!

6
00:00:12,500 --> 00:00:13,660
Nostalgia, or what?

7
00:00:13,660 --> 00:00:17,500
For those of you who might not have been around for a while, I've actually worked with Always before.

8
00:00:17,500 --> 00:00:21,760
A couple of years ago I did SEVEN videos with them during half a year's time,

9
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:23,840
and it was all very appreciated.

10
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:27,620
I appreciated that you appreciated those videos.

11
00:00:27,640 --> 00:00:31,780
So now, me and Always have put our brilliant heads together once again,

12
00:00:31,780 --> 00:00:34,640
and it's time for a new Always Vlog!

13
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:38,140
Today I want to talk to you about Keep Going Like A Girl.

14
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:42,060
2014 I made a video about the phrase "like a girl".

15
00:00:42,080 --> 00:00:46,840
To do something "like a girl" is to by definition to do something in a bad way.

16
00:00:46,840 --> 00:00:49,500
They throw like a girl. They drive like a woman.

17
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:53,440
Or, on the other hand, to do just anything "like a man":

18
00:00:53,480 --> 00:00:56,340
Wow. Cool. Solid.

19
00:00:56,340 --> 00:01:00,640
Like a man, man up, grow some balls.

20
00:01:00,660 --> 00:01:06,360
And you might think this is weird, since about half of the world's population are girls,

21
00:01:06,380 --> 00:01:08,160
Or women. Or hags.

22
00:01:08,220 --> 00:01:13,020
So if our identity is used as slang for doing somethng badly...

23
00:01:13,820 --> 00:01:16,960
... then that's pretty dull. I won't accept that.

24
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:20,140
It's basically worth repeating, so here we go again.

25
00:01:20,160 --> 00:01:24,180
But this time I want to talk to you about the phrase "keep going like a girl".

26
00:01:24,180 --> 00:01:28,120
I think many recognize the feeling of not wanting to fail.

27
00:01:28,120 --> 00:01:29,140
And not just like:

28
00:01:29,140 --> 00:01:32,640
Well, it didn't work this time, shit happens but let's try again.

29
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:33,760
But more like:

30
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:36,100
ARRGHH NOO EVERYTHING'S RUINED I'M DYING

31
00:01:36,100 --> 00:01:39,520
And I believe that a lot of people therefore don't even want to try new things

32
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:41,800
because in that way they don't risk failing.

33
00:01:42,220 --> 00:01:45,700
But this is stupid, really. Of course you have to fail sometimes.

34
00:01:45,700 --> 00:01:49,080
And this is something that me and Always want to change!

35
00:01:49,080 --> 00:01:52,360
Keep going. Keep going like a girl.

36
00:01:52,360 --> 00:01:54,840
Or like a boy, if you prefer that.

37
00:01:54,980 --> 00:01:57,920
Or like a queer. Or like a human.

38
00:01:57,980 --> 00:01:59,980
Or like a boss ass bitch.

39
00:02:00,060 --> 00:02:05,380
I am a girl. So deep down I feel like everybody should keep going like me.

40
00:02:05,380 --> 00:02:09,540
Because I'm, believe it or not, really good at going all in like a girl.

41
00:02:09,540 --> 00:02:14,700
But I thought, it's not just girls who uses pads, so I asked Always if it would be okay to interpret freely,

42
00:02:14,700 --> 00:02:17,100
to add your own identity or what you want to be.

43
00:02:17,100 --> 00:02:19,295
And Always were like "wohoo keep goin gurrl"

44
00:02:19,300 --> 00:02:22,680
but the main thing is to keep going like a girl.

45
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:24,880
Maybe because girls are the best. But I don't know.

46
00:02:24,880 --> 00:02:26,840
And I know it's super easy for me to sit here and be all like

47
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:29,420
COME ON DON'T BE AFRAID TO FAIL

48
00:02:29,420 --> 00:02:35,140
But believe me, this is a struggle for me too. Because you know what? I suck at failing.

49
00:02:35,140 --> 00:02:38,760
Not that I'm a bad loser. I'm neither a bad loser or a bad winner.

50
00:02:38,780 --> 00:02:42,740
I just don't like letting myself down.

51
00:02:42,740 --> 00:02:46,700
Can we all just agree that bad winners are ten times worse than bad losers..?

52
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:51,780
I'd rather avoid situations where there's a slight risk of failure,

53
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:55,280
instead of throwing myself out there with the chance of succeeding.

54
00:02:55,300 --> 00:02:57,580
Which I guess makes me kinda stupid.

55
00:02:57,780 --> 00:03:00,440
Because this makes me miss out on loads of fun things.

56
00:03:00,440 --> 00:03:06,480
Here's a list of three great things that I've never done because of the fear of failing:

57
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:08,760
One: dance classes at the gym.

58
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:13,180
The dance classes look like so much fun. But I think I'm too bad at dancing.

59
00:03:13,180 --> 00:03:18,780
And that makes me don't want to try to learn, because I know I will fail on my way to learning.

60
00:03:18,780 --> 00:03:19,960
That is stupid

61
00:03:19,960 --> 00:03:22,980
Two: to apply for certain jobs or educations.

62
00:03:22,980 --> 00:03:27,680
I could really just apply, and the worst thing that could happen is that I'd be declined.

63
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:29,880
But that rejection is freaking me out.

64
00:03:29,900 --> 00:03:34,760
The thought of going to a job interview or taking an admission test

65
00:03:34,900 --> 00:03:38,860
and recieve, in black and white, that "no, you're not good enough, you've failed"...

66
00:03:38,920 --> 00:03:44,100
Just the thought of that is so much tougher than the joy would have been great if I'd get a positive response.

67
00:03:44,100 --> 00:03:46,060
I suck. I'm worthless.

68
00:03:46,060 --> 00:03:48,520
I'm gonna die poor and lonely.

69
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:50,720
And cold. Brrrr.

70
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:52,360
Three: stand up.

71
00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:55,020
This says a lot, since I'm actually already working with humour.

72
00:03:55,020 --> 00:03:57,540
I consider this, youtube, my profession,

73
00:03:57,560 --> 00:04:02,820
to be humouros. I make an effort. I want my videos to be funny and entertaining.

74
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:08,400
But the thought of standing up in front of a live audience, and that audience might not think you're funny...

75
00:04:08,460 --> 00:04:10,160
Ouch, my heart.

76
00:04:10,220 --> 00:04:13,400
I've wanted to try stand up for four years. FOUR YEARS.

77
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:18,240
I've signed up for three different gigs, and then dropped out a couple of weeks before the event.

78
00:04:18,240 --> 00:04:24,680
It's so hard. Maybe the thought of failing is harder than actually failing?

79
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:27,180
OH DAMN GURL that's deep

80
00:04:27,180 --> 00:04:32,320
But I also think that in this hysterical fear of failing

81
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:37,540
you succeed with other things, because you basically forgot to be scared of the risk of failing.

82
00:04:37,540 --> 00:04:41,500
Here are some things that I've succeeded with, despite my total fear of failure:

83
00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:44,120
I cut all of my hair off. Twice.

84
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:47,440
I became a freelancer and started my own firm, and then an incorporated company.

85
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:52,100
And I actually failed, twice, before I understood how to fill in the damn paperwork correctly.

86
00:04:52,100 --> 00:04:55,180
And I moved here. To Stockholm, from Gothenburg,

87
00:04:55,220 --> 00:04:58,120
when I was 19 years old. I knew zero people here.

88
00:04:58,120 --> 00:05:03,340
It's harder than you expect to build up work, a home and a social network from scratch.

89
00:05:03,340 --> 00:05:06,620
I felt so lonely and like such a failure for like a year,

90
00:05:06,620 --> 00:05:09,900
but now I've lived here for four years and I'm so happy I did it.

91
00:05:09,900 --> 00:05:11,380
Inspiration!

92
00:05:11,380 --> 00:05:13,440
So how do you do to keep going?

93
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:17,160
I think it's very important to practise failing.

94
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:19,880
Since it's so terrifyingly hard, start easy.

95
00:05:19,880 --> 00:05:23,640
Buy a scratch ticket, and try not to get disappointed if you don't win anything.

96
00:05:23,640 --> 00:05:26,140
After all, that's also a failure.

97
00:05:26,140 --> 00:05:29,680
After that, intensify your failures. Apply for a job you certainly won't get.

98
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:33,640
But don't prepare to not get the job. Prepare to give it your best.

99
00:05:33,640 --> 00:05:37,120
The risk is huge that you won't get it, the risk is huge that you'll fail.

100
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:38,460
But what if you actually get it?

101
00:05:38,460 --> 00:05:43,980
Sometimes you gotta do things that are bound to fail, just to learn how it feels.

102
00:05:43,980 --> 00:05:46,160
Are failures really that terrible..?

103
00:05:46,280 --> 00:05:49,520
I mean, they're only dreams... getting crushed...

104
00:05:50,580 --> 00:05:55,180
And the thing is, when you succeed, you go forwards, upwards,

105
00:05:55,180 --> 00:05:56,580
but if you fail...

106
00:05:57,880 --> 00:06:04,040
... you just stay. You don't go backwards, you don't get worse. You just stay.

107
00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:07,460
And then you try again. Keep going. I believe in you.

108
00:06:07,460 --> 00:06:11,700
And that's what I and my beloved Always wanted to speak about with you today! Failures.

109
00:06:11,700 --> 00:06:15,680
But here's the thing. In a couple of weeks I'll be doing another Always vlog.

110
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:19,860
In that video I'll do something that I've dreamt about for several years,

111
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:23,980
but never dared to try because I'm too scared of failing.

112
00:06:23,980 --> 00:06:26,700
I'm so so so so nervous.

113
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:29,520
Ahhh!! But I'm also so tired of holding back.

114
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:31,860
Time to go! And keep going!

115
00:06:31,860 --> 00:06:35,460
I also want to be kinda inspo and say that if I can, then you can.

116
00:06:35,460 --> 00:06:42,560
You don't wanna miss this! In a couple of days I'll announce on my instagram what my challenge is.

117
00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:48,500
Do you also not like failing? If you have funny stories about failures, please write me a comment.

118
00:06:48,500 --> 00:06:53,540
Guys, thanks for watching, and thanks Always! See you later!

119
00:06:53,540 --> 00:06:56,440
Take care and I'll see you guys as usual next Monday.

120
00:06:56,440 --> 00:06:56,960
Bye!
