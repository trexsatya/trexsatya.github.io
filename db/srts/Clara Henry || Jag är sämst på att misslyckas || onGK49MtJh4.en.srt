00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,480
Hello!
 Do you know, what is time for today?

2
00:00:03,489 --> 00:00:07,704
It's actually time for an Always Vlog!

3
00:00:07,711 --> 00:00:11,086
This video I do in proud collaboration with Always

4
00:00:11,146 --> 00:00:12,411
Binds, everyone!

5
00:00:12,411 --> 00:00:13,323
Nostalgia, or what.

6
00:00:13,572 --> 00:00:17,373
For those of you who may not have been with me for so long, I have actually worked with Always before.

7
00:00:17,471 --> 00:00:21,651
A few years ago I made a full seven videos with them for six months

8
00:00:21,681 --> 00:00:23,795
and they were so much appreciated

9
00:00:24,174 --> 00:00:27,919
So I appreciated so much that you appreciate them so much

10
00:00:27,919 --> 00:00:29,389
Now I and Always have

11
00:00:29,389 --> 00:00:32,120
struck our brilliant skulls together again

12
00:00:32,148 --> 00:00:34,458
It's time for a new Always vlog

13
00:00:34,564 --> 00:00:38,032
And today I was going to talk about "Keep Going Like A Girl"

14
00:00:38,484 --> 00:00:41,963
2014 I made an always vlog that was about the phrase "like a girl"

15
00:00:42,245 --> 00:00:43,983
If one does anything "like a girl"

16
00:00:44,256 --> 00:00:46,914
Then there is something that by definition in a bad way

17
00:00:47,115 --> 00:00:48,215
They throw like a girl

18
00:00:48,395 --> 00:00:49,803
They drive like a girlfriend

19
00:00:49,871 --> 00:00:51,014
Or on the other hand

20
00:00:51,068 --> 00:00:53,299
To do just about anything 'like a man'

21
00:00:53,569 --> 00:00:54,132
Wow.

22
00:00:54,848 --> 00:00:56,170
Cool, stable!

23
00:00:56,313 --> 00:00:58,341
Like a man-like man!

24
00:00:58,481 --> 00:01:00,851
Man up.
 Grow some balls.

25
00:01:01,059 --> 00:01:03,004
And this one might think is really strange

26
00:01:03,177 --> 00:01:05,198
Because half of the world's population is girls

27
00:01:06,159 --> 00:01:08,486
Or women.
 Or girlfriends.

28
00:01:08,642 --> 00:01:09,837
And about our identity

29
00:01:10,064 --> 00:01:12,785
used as a slang to do something in a bad way

30
00:01:12,943 --> 00:01:15,116
... then it's pretty sad.

31
00:01:15,296 --> 00:01:16,725
I'm not going to agree to this

32
00:01:16,927 --> 00:01:19,946
It can be repeated simply, so today we drive again.

33
00:01:20,316 --> 00:01:24,175
But today I was going to talk about the phrase "keep going like a girl".

34
00:01:24,430 --> 00:01:28,064
I think many people can recognize that you find it difficult to fail.

35
00:01:28,284 --> 00:01:31,374
And like not just, uh, it doesn't work this time

36
00:01:31,739 --> 00:01:32,917
It was sad, but again.

37
00:01:33,089 --> 00:01:33,739
Without more ...

38
00:01:33,999 --> 00:01:36,237
Oh no!
 Everything is ruined, I will die!

39
00:01:36,397 --> 00:01:39,447
And I also think then there are many who even shit in testing

40
00:01:39,616 --> 00:01:41,496
Because then you avoid that risk of failure.

41
00:01:41,718 --> 00:01:43,328
But this is really stupid.

42
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:45,667
It is clear that you have to be able to fail sometimes.

43
00:01:45,841 --> 00:01:49,328
And this is exactly what Always and I want to change.

44
00:01:49,473 --> 00:01:52,527
Keep Going.
 Keep Going, Like A Girl.

45
00:01:52,688 --> 00:01:54,763
Or as a guy, if you would rather.

46
00:01:54,950 --> 00:01:57,809
Or as a queer, or as a human being.

47
00:01:58,079 --> 00:01:59,818
Or like a boss ass bitch.

48
00:02:00,327 --> 00:02:05,422
I am a girl, and I think deep down that everyone should "keep going like me".

49
00:02:05,751 --> 00:02:09,499
But I'm thought or not, damn good at meat like a girl sometimes.

50
00:02:09,762 --> 00:02:11,978
But I think it's not just girls using bindings.

51
00:02:12,128 --> 00:02:14,525
So that I asked Always if it is okay to interpret the expression freely,

52
00:02:14,682 --> 00:02:17,139
To throw in what one is or wants to be

53
00:02:17,279 --> 00:02:19,330
And Always Ba, Woohoo, Keep Going Girl!

54
00:02:19,503 --> 00:02:22,650
And the main point is thus, Keep GOing Like A Girl.

55
00:02:22,860 --> 00:02:23,920
Maybe because girls are the best.

56
00:02:24,066 --> 00:02:24,960
But I don't know.

57
00:02:25,141 --> 00:02:27,074
And I know it's super easy for me and sit here and pray:

58
00:02:27,222 --> 00:02:29,331
Come on and dare to fail!

59
00:02:29,502 --> 00:02:32,119
But believe me, this is a struggle for me with.

60
00:02:32,306 --> 00:02:35,020
Do you know what, I'm the worst at failing.

61
00:02:35,202 --> 00:02:36,779
Not because I'm a bad loser.

62
00:02:36,966 --> 00:02:38,510
I'm neither a bad loser nor a bad winner.

63
00:02:38,653 --> 00:02:42,660
But I just think it's hard to disappoint myself.

64
00:02:42,817 --> 00:02:46,660
Can we only agree that bad winners are ten times more difficult than bad losers?

65
00:02:46,731 --> 00:02:47,052
Oh!

66
00:02:47,052 --> 00:02:49,642
I much rather avoid situations there

67
00:02:49,642 --> 00:02:50,973
There is a small risk that I can fail.

68
00:02:50,973 --> 00:02:54,885
Than to throw myself in with a chance to actually succeed.

69
00:02:55,044 --> 00:02:57,312
Which then means that you are a little stupid.

70
00:02:57,463 --> 00:03:00,691
Because you miss out on very fun things.

71
00:03:00,834 --> 00:03:05,184
Here comes a list of three really fun things that I have lost because I simply

72
00:03:05,318 --> 00:03:06,487
Is too scared to fail:

73
00:03:06,614 --> 00:03:09,039
One: dance pass at the gym.

74
00:03:09,167 --> 00:03:10,626
The dance pass looks so fun.

75
00:03:10,769 --> 00:03:13,191
But I think I'm too bad at dancing.

76
00:03:13,340 --> 00:03:15,170
And then I don't even want to try to learn.

77
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:16,989
Because I know that I will fail

78
00:03:17,147 --> 00:03:18,697
On the way to me having learned.

79
00:03:18,839 --> 00:03:20,087
That is stupid

80
00:03:20,198 --> 00:03:20,819
Two:

81
00:03:20,970 --> 00:03:22,991
To apply for certain jobs or training.

82
00:03:23,151 --> 00:03:24,250
I could really pray:

83
00:03:24,389 --> 00:03:24,900
Apply.

84
00:03:25,010 --> 00:03:26,610
And the absolute worst that could happen,

85
00:03:26,759 --> 00:03:27,834
is that I would get a no.

86
00:03:27,940 --> 00:03:29,680
But: This no is so scary.

87
00:03:29,830 --> 00:03:32,187
The idea of going on a job interview

88
00:03:32,350 --> 00:03:34,434
Or do an intake test

89
00:03:34,583 --> 00:03:38,041
And black on white that: No, you're not good enough.

90
00:03:38,142 --> 00:03:38,742
You have failed.

91
00:03:38,878 --> 00:03:39,532
That thought

92
00:03:39,532 --> 00:03:43,282
Is so much more difficult than what happiness would have been great

93
00:03:43,308 --> 00:03:44,456
If I had actually come in.

94
00:03:44,592 --> 00:03:46,634
I suck.
 IM worthless.
 I will die .

95
00:03:46,634 --> 00:03:47,932
Poor and alone.

96
00:03:47,932 --> 00:03:49,072
And cold.

97
00:03:49,443 --> 00:03:50,999
Brr.
 Three:

98
00:03:50,999 --> 00:03:52,251
Standup.

99
00:03:52,474 --> 00:03:53,352
This is so speaking,

100
00:03:53,480 --> 00:03:54,904
Given that I am actually doing humor.

101
00:03:55,075 --> 00:03:56,656
I think this;
 Youtube, my occupation

102
00:03:56,836 --> 00:03:59,061
Have elements of humor

103
00:03:59,254 --> 00:04:00,022
I make an effort.

104
00:04:00,167 --> 00:04:01,306
I want my videos

105
00:04:01,455 --> 00:04:02,870
Must be entertaining and fun.

106
00:04:02,980 --> 00:04:04,961
But the idea of facing an audience

107
00:04:05,125 --> 00:04:08,252
And that the audience might not think I'm fun

108
00:04:08,402 --> 00:04:10,302
Aaaaj, my heart.

109
00:04:10,434 --> 00:04:11,985
I have wanted to test standup for four years.

110
00:04:12,155 --> 00:04:13,387
FOUR YEARS.

111
00:04:13,528 --> 00:04:15,768
I have booked in on three different gigs, and then pull myself out.

112
00:04:15,925 --> 00:04:18,360
Two weeks before.

113
00:04:18,500 --> 00:04:19,470
It is so tough

114
00:04:19,470 --> 00:04:20,840
It may be the case that the thought

115
00:04:20,840 --> 00:04:24,863
On failing is more difficult than an actual failure?

116
00:04:25,036 --> 00:04:26,892
OH DAMN GIRL, THATS DEEP!

117
00:04:27,267 --> 00:04:29,175
But I also think that in this total

118
00:04:29,349 --> 00:04:32,318
The life of life to fail

119
00:04:32,468 --> 00:04:34,086
Then you have succeeded with other things

120
00:04:34,243 --> 00:04:37,739
By simply forgetting that you may be able to fail them.

121
00:04:37,886 --> 00:04:39,183
Here some things that I have succeeded

122
00:04:39,290 --> 00:04:41,649
Although I am absolutely fucking scared to fail:

123
00:04:41,799 --> 00:04:43,029
I cut off all my hair.

124
00:04:43,149 --> 00:04:44,266
Twice.

125
00:04:44,420 --> 00:04:45,266
I became a freelancer.

126
00:04:45,415 --> 00:04:46,469
And started an individual company.

127
00:04:46,619 --> 00:04:47,616
And then a limited company.

128
00:04:47,766 --> 00:04:52,220
And I failed twice before I finally understood how to fill in this damn form.

129
00:04:52,361 --> 00:04:53,123
And then I moved here

130
00:04:53,285 --> 00:04:54,044
To Stockholm.

131
00:04:54,147 --> 00:04:55,110
From Gothenburg.

132
00:04:55,243 --> 00:04:58,470
When I was 19 - I knew 0 people here.

133
00:04:58,580 --> 00:05:02,622
And it is more difficult than you think to have to build up jobs, accommodation and social interaction

134
00:05:02,622 --> 00:05:03,418
Completely again

135
00:05:03,565 --> 00:05:06,587
I felt so lonely and unsuccessful for almost a year.

136
00:05:06,686 --> 00:05:07,808
But now I have lived here for four years

137
00:05:07,960 --> 00:05:09,846
And I'm so happy that I dared.

138
00:05:09,986 --> 00:05:11,226
Inspiration!

139
00:05:11,362 --> 00:05:13,276
So how do you do, to keep going?

140
00:05:13,426 --> 00:05:16,957
I think it's super important to practice failing.

141
00:05:17,097 --> 00:05:18,927
And because it is so terrible

142
00:05:19,068 --> 00:05:20,155
You can start hard to start easily.

143
00:05:20,298 --> 00:05:23,572
Buy a scratch card and try not to be disappointed unless you win anything.

144
00:05:23,705 --> 00:05:26,102
On the whole, it is also a failure.

145
00:05:26,232 --> 00:05:27,853
and then you can start increasing their failures

146
00:05:28,002 --> 00:05:28,850
Look for a job!

147
00:05:29,006 --> 00:05:29,747
That you won't get.

148
00:05:29,878 --> 00:05:30,387
But!

149
00:05:30,529 --> 00:05:32,008
Do not set yourself not to get it.

150
00:05:32,157 --> 00:05:33,657
Set yourself to bet.

151
00:05:33,807 --> 00:05:35,258
The risk is then that you will not get it.

152
00:05:35,407 --> 00:05:37,051
There is a great risk that you will fail.

153
00:05:37,177 --> 00:05:38,390
But what if you get it then.

154
00:05:38,535 --> 00:05:40,229
Sometimes you may even have to test

155
00:05:40,378 --> 00:05:41,777
Something that is doomed to failure

156
00:05:41,935 --> 00:05:43,862
Just to learn to feel that feeling

157
00:05:43,995 --> 00:05:46,027
Are one's failures so heavenly dangerous

158
00:05:46,149 --> 00:05:48,109
I mean it's just ... Dreams ...

159
00:05:48,253 --> 00:05:49,852
Like ... crushed ...

160
00:05:49,995 --> 00:05:54,237
And the thing is that if you succeed, then you will come forward.

161
00:05:54,377 --> 00:05:55,051
You are coming up.

162
00:05:55,169 --> 00:05:56,359
But if you fail ...

163
00:05:56,490 --> 00:05:59,257
Then you stay there.

164
00:05:59,404 --> 00:06:00,180
You don't go backwards.

165
00:06:00,340 --> 00:06:01,578
You don't get any worse.

166
00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:04,042
You just ... stay there.

167
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:05,179
And then you have to try again.

168
00:06:05,302 --> 00:06:06,053
Keep Going.

169
00:06:06,175 --> 00:06:07,389
I believe in you.

170
00:06:07,552 --> 00:06:10,309
And that was what I and loved Always wanted to talk to you today.

171
00:06:10,458 --> 00:06:11,847
Failure ..

172
00:06:11,997 --> 00:06:13,358
With now it is actually like this:

173
00:06:13,488 --> 00:06:15,610
In a few weeks I will make one to Always vlog

174
00:06:15,710 --> 00:06:17,808
and in that video i will expose myself to something

175
00:06:17,926 --> 00:06:19,545
As I have been dreaming of for several years

176
00:06:19,660 --> 00:06:23,700
But never dared to test because I am simply too scared to fail.

177
00:06:23,832 --> 00:06:26,502
I'm so heavenly heavenly nervous.

178
00:06:26,627 --> 00:06:27,308
Aah!

179
00:06:27,415 --> 00:06:29,063
But I'm so tired of just holding back

180
00:06:29,186 --> 00:06:31,831
Time to just go!
 And Keep Going!

181
00:06:31,960 --> 00:06:33,440
And so you want to be a little inspo too
