Hi, my name is Alexandra Zazzi and have been working in restaurant kitchens for over 25 years.

2
00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:13.420
It is both wonderful and inspiring.

3
00:00:13.420 --> 00:00:15.320
But there are some risks.

4
00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:19.540
Therefore, there are work environment rules to protect those who work here.

5
00:00:20.360 --> 00:00:23.780
Unfortunately there are employers who do not know these rules

6
00:00:24.040 --> 00:00:26.400
or chooses to deliberately ignore them

7
00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:32.340
To save time, save money and to obtain benefits towards their competitors.

8
00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:34.560
It is called unhealthy competition.

9
00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:38.440
Follow, and I'll show you what a good kitchen looks like,

10
00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:39.240
where you follow the rules.

11
00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:44.080
Do you see the lamp here outside the freezer room

12
00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:45.380
It's an alarm.

13
00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:50.860
If I were to be locked up, there is a button to press in there so that the lamp starts flashing.

14
00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:54.240
It's minus 20 in there, so you can freeze to death.

15
00:00:58.040 --> 00:01:00.620
Hey here i am again

16
00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:03.680
This roasting table has a tip cover.

17
00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:08.680
And it is also important that it stands firm so it cannot overturn and cause crush damage.

18
00:01:13.620 --> 00:01:14.500
Hello there

19
00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:20.860
Here at the fryer, there is definitely no running water nearby.

20
00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:25.860
If there is water in the hot oil, it can start to splash and in the worst case start to burn.

21
00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:28.620
And always have a lid nearby.

22
00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:34.580
Here in the counter there is eye shower.

23
00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:41.180
There must be, so you can flush your eyes in case that you have got corrosive detergents on the face.

24
00:01:43.003 --> 00:01:44.700
Obviously there is a lot to think about,

25
00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:49.829
But it pays off in the long run and in the end it is about the health of the staff.

26
00:01:52.206 --> 00:01:56.446
And now we will look at what it looks like in a kitchen where you do not follow the rules.

27
00:01:57.126 --> 00:01:58.346
Look here

28
00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:00.400
The machines are connected to joint boxes.

29
00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:06.940
This means that both bench and machines can be live and it is fatal.

30
00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:23.680
This is just too crowded

31
00:02:41.826 --> 00:02:42.926
And look there.

32
00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:47.920
It really doesn't look good.
 Remember to place heavy goods correctly.

33
00:03:08.883 --> 00:03:10.243
She barely has time.

34
00:03:10.243 --> 00:03:14.472
Stress is a serious health problem.
 She would need some help here.

35
00:03:32.572 --> 00:03:33.192
Ouch ouch ouch

36
00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:35.480
That could have gone really, really bad.

37
00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:39.600
Think about floors and shoes, and that the dressing box is always filled.

38
00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:55.060
Hope you thought it was interesting to see what ignorance, nonchalance and unhealthy competition

39
00:03:55.060 --> 00:03:57.060
can bring with it and what the consequences can be.

40
00:03:58.460 --> 00:04:02.500
It is the employer who is responsible for ensuring that the staff has a good working environment.

41
00:04:03.117 --> 00:04:06.797
But the staff should also say if you see dangers in the work environment.

42
00:04:07.557 --> 00:04:10.057
Then you can avoid injuries and sick leave

43
00:04:10.340 --> 00:04:13.860
Which is tough for the staff and by extension the community costs money.

44
00:04:15.340 --> 00:04:17.700
It is important that those who work with procurement,

45
00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:21.440
For example, of food to schools, hospitals and elderly homes,

46
00:04:21.894 --> 00:04:26.174
places demands on the working environment of the employers who submit tenders.

47
00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:29.860
Then a good working environment can be a competitive advantage.

48
00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:34.420
It benefits both serious employers and the staff.

49
00:04:35.020 --> 00:04:36.160
bye
