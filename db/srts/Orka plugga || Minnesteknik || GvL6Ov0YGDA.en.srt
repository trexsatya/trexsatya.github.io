00:00:00,800 --> 00:00:03,400
Here are some mnemonic techniques-

2
00:00:03,560 --> 00:00:07,560
-that can help you remember
what you've learnt.

3
00:00:08,280 --> 00:00:11,080
One good method is the ten-minute rule.

4
00:00:11,240 --> 00:00:14,480
The key to remembering better
is repetition.

5
00:00:14,640 --> 00:00:18,640
Without repetition,
what we learn is quickly forgotten.

6
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:22,800
And remember to review
before you start forgetting.

7
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:28,960
The first repetition should be soon
after learning, after ten minutes.

8
00:00:29,120 --> 00:00:31,520
Or you will quickly forget.

9
00:00:31,680 --> 00:00:36,080
Next repetition should be the next day,
and the following the next week.

10
00:00:36,240 --> 00:00:39,080
If you want a memory for life,
review again-

11
00:00:39,240 --> 00:00:42,720
-after a month
and again after six months.

12
00:00:42,880 --> 00:00:47,360
A good method for repetition is
to test yourself with flashcards.

13
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:50,840
Notes where you write the word, name-

14
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:56,040
-or concept that you're learning on
one side, and the answer on the other.

15
00:00:56,200 --> 00:00:59,040
If you're learning English vocabulary-

16
00:00:59,200 --> 00:01:04,200
-write the English word on one side
and the Swedish word on the other.

17
00:01:04,360 --> 00:01:06,880
Flashcards are easy to take with you-

18
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:11,480
-so you can test yourself
during recess or on the bus.

19
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:17,040
Another efficient memory technique
is association-

20
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:21,000
-connecting new knowledge
with something you associate it with.

21
00:01:21,160 --> 00:01:24,480
That makes it easier to remember.

22
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:28,920
Let's say you're learning a new word.
What does it sound like?

23
00:01:29,080 --> 00:01:34,280
What does it make you think of?
Try to make a picture in your mind.

24
00:01:34,440 --> 00:01:39,040
Or try to make up a rhyme
that ties together the associations.

25
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:43,680
The weirder the better -
then you'll remember them easier.

26
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:49,920
You could also try using a memory walk,
also called the loci method.

27
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:54,480
Imagine yourself placing the facts
that you need to learn-

28
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:57,440
-in different familiar places-

29
00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:01,000
-in your home, perhaps,
or along the way to school.

30
00:02:01,160 --> 00:02:04,560
You'll connect what you're learning
with the places-

31
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:07,720
-and create associations.

32
00:02:07,880 --> 00:02:11,600
During the exam,
you can walk the walk in your mind-

33
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:15,320
-and retrieve the facts
linked to the places.

34
00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:20,800
Make sure to stick to the same order
as when you placed the facts.

35
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:26,880
One last trick to remember during an
exam is to use a permitted cheat sheet.

36
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:30,360
Once you've sat down,
ask for a piece of paper.

37
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:36,080
Write down all facts, words, or formulas
that you think you might forget.

38
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:40,760
That way you can avoid
unnecessary stress during the exam-

39
00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:45,320
-and use your energy
to answer the questions instead.
