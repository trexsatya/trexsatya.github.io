1
00:00:35,975 --> 00:00:38,775
We were, so to speak, a cocktail battalion,

2
00:00:38,780 --> 00:00:42,240
Thus, a reduced battalion.

3
00:00:43,400 --> 00:00:46.560
They did your job. When you were free you went down to the beach

4
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:48,400
And sunbathed.

5
00:00:48,920 --> 00:00:52,520
Then we were out in town in the evenings and then you worked again.

6
00:00:53,980 --> 00:00:55,960
It was such a life actually.

7
00:00:57,720 --> 00:01:00,740
It was sunbathed and it was drank a lot.

8
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:30,340
It was a friend of me like

9
00:01:30,425 --> 00:01:33,455
Called and asked if I would keep up with Cyprus.

10
00:01:33,460 --> 00:01:35,300
And then I hung on.

11
00:01:35,380 --> 00:01:36,380
Of course.

12
00:01:37,220 --> 00:01:40,600
My biggest wish was to become an officer.

13
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:46,440
So I moved in to P 2 in Hässleholm.

14
00:01:47,900 --> 00:01:50,140
But then I was involved

15
00:01:50,380 --> 00:01:52,780
in a difficult car accident.

16
00:01:55,120 --> 00:01:56,740
He who was driving fell asleep

17
00:01:56,980 --> 00:01:58,300
at the steering wheel.

18
00:01:58,580 --> 00:02:01,360
It was facial injuries, jaw injuries

19
00:02:01,365 --> 00:02:02.385
And everything.

20
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,520
So I was engaged for a year.

21
00:02:06,120 --> 00:02:09,000
In order to continue the education I started

22
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:12.060
Should I redo the military service from the beginning.

23
00:02:12,500 --> 00:02:15,195
I can feel even today

24
00:02:15,195 --> 00:02:18,405
That I did not get the chance to continue.

25
00:02:18,405 --> 00:02:19,320
But

26
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:22,140
I couldn't do anything about it.

27
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:23,960
It was just moving on.

28
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:34,760
So when I got the chance to do UN service

29
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:36,820
It was clear, 100 percent.

30
00:02:36,920 --> 00:02:38,280
I'm going!

31
00:02:39,140 --> 00:02:40,680
For me it was

32
00:02:40,940 --> 00:02:43,100
no challenge, without that

33
00:02:43,540 --> 00:02:46,460
Would be wonderful to serve down here.

34
00:02:49,300 --> 00:02:52.060
Although they went to "Tjotahejti"

35
00:02:52,220 --> 00:02:53,860
So I had followed.

36
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:05,760
But I had the wrong idea of Cyprus.

37
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:10,140
I thought Cyprus was a flat island

38
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:12,360
With just sand.

39
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:15,060
So you got a shock when you landed in Nicosia

40
00:03:15,060 --> 00:03:18,220
And got to see the high mountains and nature.

41
00:03:49,020 --> 00:03:51,600
I know that Cyprus has a very long

42
00:03:51,940 --> 00:03:54,580
history.

43
00:03:55,020 --> 00:03:57,340
But I think you should start in 1974,

44
00:03:57,340 --> 00:04:00,280
Before we got here.

45
00:04:11,085 --> 00:04:13,795
Now the Greek Cypriots want

46
00:04:13,795 --> 00:04:16,375
together with national grave

47
00:04:16,860 --> 00:04:18,840
make a coup and incorporate

48
00:04:18,960 --> 00:04:20,480
Cyprus with Greece.

49
00:04:21,520 --> 00:04:23,980
And the battalion that we

50
00:04:24,755 --> 00:04:26,215
resolved

51
00:04:27,465 --> 00:04:30,725
They probably had it pretty quiet.

52
00:04:31,060 --> 00:04:33,580
It was a so -called cocktail battalion,

53
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:37,220
But I don't want to sense their job down here.

54
00:04:38,060 --> 00:04:41,280
And it was the same when we came down in April.

55
00:04:41,340 --> 00:04:43,500
We didn't have much to do.

56
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:45,360
It was pretty smooth,

57
00:04:46,140 --> 00:04:47,660
It actually was.

58
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:49,860
But

59
00:04:51,340 --> 00:04:53,340
It changed quickly.

60
00:04:57,280 --> 00:05:00,140
"Turkish troops invaded Cyprus earlier today."

61
00:05:01,100 --> 00:05:04,220
“It announced Turkey's Prime Minister Ecevit who said

62
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:09.400
that troops have arrived in Cyprus early this morning. "

63
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:16,500
You were a little prepared.

64
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:18,820
One went and pondered what would happen

65
00:05:18,980 --> 00:05:22,040
With me and the weapon I have.

66
00:05:24,860 --> 00:05:29,100
On July 20, the Turks went ashore at Kyrenia.

67
00:05:30,060 --> 00:05:33,020
They stayed there for a week

68
00:05:33,020 --> 00:05:35,620
And there were fierce battles at Kyrenia.

69
00:05:35,660 --> 00:05:39.560
There were parachute troops, warships and everything possible.

70
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:44,740
Then you walked slowly towards Famagusta

71
00:05:44,840 --> 00:05:50,980
And it took a month for the troops to get there.

72
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:55,460
They thus first first received Greeks in front of them

73
00:05:56,420 --> 00:05:58,540
because they would get rid of everyone.

74
00:05:58,660 --> 00:06:00,240
It was ethnic erection.

75
00:06:00,340 --> 00:06:04.080
They would get rid of all Greeks and set a limit.

76
00:06:54,320 --> 00:06:56,900
We were seven man on an observation site

77
00:06:56,940 --> 00:06:59.440
And as a sergeant, I was group manager.

78
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:02.860
We had a guarding task to take care of.

79
00:07:02,940 --> 00:07:05.575
All that moved in the terrain

80
00:07:05,575 --> 00:07:07.925
Written on a list

81
00:07:07,925 --> 00:07:10,145
and reported on.

82
00:07:10,340 --> 00:07:13,380
It was such information we had at all observational sites.

83
00:07:13,640 --> 00:07:16,940
“The most sensitive point in the entire Famagusta area

84
00:07:17,080 --> 00:07:18,500
is the harbor. ”

85
00:07:19,040 --> 00:07:20,760
“The Greek Cypriots have fortified the harbor

86
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:23,620
of the fear of invasion from Turkey. "

87
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:29,160
The first observation site I was at

88
00:07:29,320 --> 00:07:32,760
was called Othello Tower.

89
00:07:32,895 --> 00:07:35,585
There we looked at the harbor

90
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:38,480
to see if it was shipped in weapons or

91
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:41,080
If military vehicles came in.

92
00:07:43,805 --> 00:07:46,825
I was not allowed to sit guard

93
00:07:46,825 --> 00:07:48,780
Because I was group manager.

94
00:07:48,920 --> 00:07:51,160
I was responsible for radio traffic

95
00:07:51,940 --> 00:07:55,100
and i cooked breakfast and lunch

96
00:07:55,100 --> 00:07:57,200
In order for the guys to rest.

97
00:07:57,760 --> 00:07:58,980
It was a lot of card games,

98
00:07:59,040 --> 00:08:00,360
It was very sunbathing.

99
00:08:00,440 --> 00:08:03,620
It was wonderful to be in such places.

100
00:08:03,620 --> 00:08:05,980
We had a great time at the observation sites.

101
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,980
- How does it feel to go back to the camp?

102
00:08:14,100 --> 00:08:15,640
What does it arouse within you?

103
00:08:15,860 --> 00:08:18,460
- Yes, it raises great thoughts.

104
00:08:18,580 --> 00:08:21,860
It will be amazingly exciting

105
00:08:22,300 --> 00:08:25,720
Because inside there is part of my life.

106
00:08:26,165 --> 00:08:29,585
These months before the war

107
00:08:30,100 --> 00:08:33,600
Is probably among the best I've been to.

108
00:08:49,560 --> 00:08:52.080
In here lay the officers' fairs.

109
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:54,840
A bit in there.

110
00:09:05,935 --> 00:09:07.985
We lived four guys here.

111
00:09:08,835 --> 00:09:11,485
The beds so. One there, here and there.

112
00:09:11,485 --> 00:09:12,940
This was not then.

113
00:09:12,940 --> 00:09:14,540
We lived here.

114
00:09:15,180 --> 00:09:17,100
We were sergeants all four.

115
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,900
As I get into the camp now

116
00:09:21,860 --> 00:09:24,680
then i will come back to this one

117
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:28,040
The stress we call it.

118
00:09:29,260 --> 00:09:31,460
But I also feel a satisfaction

119
00:09:31,460 --> 00:09:33,180
of entering the camp.

120
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:34,340
And a joy.

121
00:09:34,580 --> 00:09:39,360
For I have had many nice moments

122
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:40,960
of my life here.

123
00:09:42,580 --> 00:09:46,200
And horrible moments too. Of course.

124
00:09:51,740 --> 00:09:54,060
July 20th when

125
00:09:54,065 --> 00:09:56,395
The Greeks walked towards the Turks.

126
00:09:56,680 --> 00:09:57,780
That was then

127
00:09:58,080 --> 00:10:00.920
The real war began.

128
00:10:04,745 --> 00:10:07,235
There was almost panic on the camp for

129
00:10:07,240 --> 00:10:08,600
get to be in shelter.

130
00:10:09,280 --> 00:10:12,100
You took your weapon, then down a pit.

131
00:10:12,400 --> 00:10:13,940
That was what mattered.

132
00:10:14,140 --> 00:10:17,500
Fort as the phase down into a pit to protect itself.

133
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:24,280
They shot through the camp.

134
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:28,540
So you couldn't go, you had to crawl in the ditches,

135
00:10:28,740 --> 00:10:31,120
Because it small everywhere.

136
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:35,320
And some ridges looked like Tesils.

137
00:10:36,100 --> 00:10:38,300
It was terrible.

138
00:10:39,260 --> 00:10:41,900
I never thought I would experience it.

139
00:10:42,300 --> 00:10:43,460
Because it was

140
00:10:44,125 --> 00:10:46,495
an incredible fire at the camp

141
00:10:46,900 --> 00:10:48,120
And all around.

142
00:10:49,560 --> 00:10:51,220
You thought

143
00:10:53,485 --> 00:10:54,485
Survive!

144
00:10:55,160 --> 00:10:57,060
So this goes to the forest.

145
00:10:57,180 --> 00:11:00.840
There came tanks that turned the tower toward us

146
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:02,200
And towards the camp.

147
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:09.980
I see and hear it in front of me now,

148
00:11:10,120 --> 00:11:12,340
screams, cries,

149
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:14,520
And gunfire.

150
00:11:14,620 --> 00:11:17,020
Bullets that come all over

151
00:11:17,800 --> 00:11:19,820
And rattles in the sand.

152
00:11:21,060 --> 00:11:23,700
When we had rushed out of

153
00:11:24,420 --> 00:11:26,240
The protection pits

154
00:11:26,280 --> 00:11:28,240
So I ended up in a covered guard.

155
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:31,420
The hole was roughly here.

156
00:11:32,040 --> 00:11:34,260
Then it went away here.

157
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:35,840
Here was a whole group.

158
00:11:36,220 --> 00:11:38,220
And I stand like this.

159
00:11:45,780 --> 00:11:47,580
I can imagine that

160
00:11:47,580 --> 00:11:49,540
Down where the guys sat.

161
00:11:49,540 --> 00:11:51,660
There it was certainly 60 degrees hot,

162
00:11:51,660 --> 00:11:53,760
Because it was 40 degrees outside.

163
00:11:54,180 --> 00:11:57,740
Rune thought it was too hot so he wanted to get up

164
00:11:58,260 --> 00:11:59,640
And look he too.

165
00:11:59,640 --> 00:12:02.460
So I backed back as much as I could.

166
00:12:02,540 --> 00:12:05,020
So he pushed himself up in front of me.

167
00:12:05,080 --> 00:12:07,220
Just as he came up, he sank down again.

168
00:12:07,280 --> 00:12:09.080
So I got hold of him like this.

169
00:12:11,280 --> 00:12:13,200
I thought he just fainted

170
00:12:13,465 --> 00:12:15,725
But then I saw that he was bleeding.

171
00:12:28,395 --> 00:12:31,135
He had received a shot in his right eye.

172
00:12:31,340 --> 00:12:34,740
Which went in and stopped four centimeters from the back of the head.

173
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03.060
I told Rune once

174
00:13:03,060 --> 00:13:05,100
that you saved my life.

175
00:13:05,480 --> 00:13:07,520
Hadn't you stood there

176
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:09,780
So I had the ball in my head.

177
00:13:10,680 --> 00:13:13,160
So I actually felt

178
00:13:13,220 --> 00:13:14,880
And I am grateful for that.

179
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,720
I feel sorry for Rune,

180
00:13:17,240 --> 00:13:18,960
that he would get it in the skull.

181
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:20,760
But it's war

182
00:13:20,760 --> 00:13:23,020
And you know what can happen.

183
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:25,000
Unfortunately, it is.

184
00:13:28,500 --> 00:13:30,680
It was heavy.

185
00:14:00,960 --> 00:14:03,940
You get some goose bumps when you look at this.

186
00:14:04,220 --> 00:14:07,220
Imagine I have been involved in this.

187
00:14:10,120 --> 00:14:13,660
We had an observation site inside Old City,

188
00:14:14,100 --> 00:14:15,000
Othello Tower.

189
00:14:15,400 --> 00:14:17,940
Below was a small restaurant.

190
00:14:18,895 --> 00:14:22,225
There were many turches and drank coffee.

191
00:14:22,225 --> 00:14:24,600
Then there was a guy there.

192
00:14:24,660 --> 00:14:27,140
He was Turkish Cypriot

193
00:14:27,220 --> 00:14:29,220
and introduced himself as Mr. Mûnûr.

194
00:14:29,460 --> 00:14:31,220
He was often there.

195
00:14:32,020 --> 00:14:34,440
Me and he began to talk

196
00:14:34,500 --> 00:14:36,240
And he was very nice.

197
00:14:36,660 --> 00:14:39,500
He told us about his family, among other things

198
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:42,320
And we met down there quite often.

199
00:14:42,920 --> 00:14:45,460
We exchanged many thoughts

200
00:14:45,640 --> 00:14:47,920
About Cyprus and everything.

201
00:14:48,020 --> 00:14:50,740
Then it was calm and peaceful.

202
00:15:06,900 --> 00:15:09.060
“Swedish UN soldiers go by mail

203
00:15:09,060 --> 00:15:12,600
at the multi -hundred -year -old fortifications. ”

204
00:15:13,400 --> 00:15:16,480
"As today should be only tourist attractions."

205
00:15:16,900 --> 00:15:19,280
“But that still matters,

206
00:15:19,285 --> 00:15:20,885
just like fortifications. ”

207
00:15:22,295 --> 00:15:24,395
The Turks were not allowed to be on the wall

208
00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:25,680
in Old City.

209
00:15:26,360 --> 00:15:29,340
Because then the Greeks shot and threw grenades.

210
00:15:29,380 --> 00:15:31,520
So we would remove them there.

211
00:15:32,620 --> 00:15:36,200
Then I got as a mission

212
00:15:36,760 --> 00:15:38,520
to become the head of that strength.

213
00:15:38,540 --> 00:15:41,155
We were a group that loaded a KP car

214
00:15:41,160 --> 00:15:43,620
and would make a temporary observation site up there.

215
00:15:43,820 --> 00:15:47,000
Then I told my driver: Don't stop for anything.

216
00:15:47,140 --> 00:15:49,295
If there is a roadblock. Drive through!

217
00:15:49,295 --> 00:15:50,345
We're going up there now.

218
00:15:51,345 --> 00:15:54,215
Then a lot of soldiers came up.

219
00:15:54,220 --> 00:15:57,140
Turkish Cypriots.

220
00:15:57,640 --> 00:16:00.580
They were of course cursed.

221
00:16:01,420 --> 00:16:03,900
But then came Mûnûr.

222
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:06,260
So he and I

223
00:16:06,280 --> 00:16:08,180
stood opposite each other.

224
00:16:08,180 --> 00:16:10,180
With each weapon.

225
00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:13,640
I was snooped but not afraid.

226
00:16:13,640 --> 00:16:16,180
I thought he couldn't shoot me.

227
00:16:16,660 --> 00:16:19,740
Then I told Mr. Mûnûr that you know what applies.

228
00:16:19,820 --> 00:16:21,120
You may not be up here,

229
00:16:21,260 --> 00:16:23,880
You have to take away your guys and go down.

230
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:27,780
But then when it got dark, at midnight.

231
00:16:28,075 --> 00:16:29,075
Then he came.

232
00:16:29,660 --> 00:16:30,680
Without weapons.

233
00:16:31,400 --> 00:16:33,900
Then we sat on the wall and talked,

234
00:16:34,440 --> 00:16:35,440
in shelter.

235
00:16:35,720 --> 00:16:37,180
It was nice.

236
00:16:48,400 --> 00:16:49,920
We are now on our way

237
00:16:50,265 --> 00:16:51.705
to Famagusta.

238
00:16:52,260 --> 00:16:53,360
Old City.

239
00:16:53,420 --> 00:16:56,620
And hopefully we will meet my old friend.

240
00:16:57,500 --> 00:16:59,340
Turken Mr. Mûnûr.

241
00:17:04,940 --> 00:17:07.880
- Hey what's up?

242
00:17:09,240 --> 00:17:12,080
Do you know this man? Mr. Mûnûr.

243
00:17:13,620 --> 00:17:14,820
- So you know him?

244
00:17:14,820 --> 00:17:15,780
- Yes.

245
00:17:17,300 --> 00:17:19,480
- He was here ten minutes ago.

246
00:17:22,740 --> 00:17:24,320
Ask for him over there.

247
00:17:24,320 --> 00:17:25,700
–Ok. Thanks!

248
00:17:47,260 --> 00:17:49,400
- Hi mr. Mûnûr!

249
00:17:49,500 --> 00:17:50,760
Mûnûr: - Welcome!

250
00:17:51,400 --> 00:17:52,520
Jan-Olov:-How are you?

251
00:17:52,520 --> 00:17:54,520
Mûnûr: - Thanks so much!

252
00:17:55,060 --> 00:17:57,580
Jan-Olov:-Fun to see you again.

253
00:17:59,960 --> 00:18:01,000
Mûnûr: - Is everything good?

254
00:18:01,880 --> 00:18:02.800
- Hey you!

255
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:07,160
Mûnûr: - Is that me?

256
00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:08,540
Jan-Olov:-Yes, and me.

257
00:18:12,020 --> 00:18:13,480
- It's been many years ago.

258
00:18:17,020 --> 00:18:18,220
Mûnûr: - Is it my house?

259
00:18:19,020 --> 00:18:20,020
Jan-Olov:-Yes.

260
00:18:20,660 --> 00:18:23,360
- I was there once with my girlfriend.

261
00:18:23,460 --> 00:18:25,460
- Do you remember?

262
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:01,900
It was fantastic, a lovely feeling actually.

263
00:19:01,900 --> 00:19:03,000
It was fun.

264
00:19:04,460 --> 00:19:07,220
And he was probably a little moved too.

265
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:10,280
It's a lovely man.

266
00:19:16,940 --> 00:19:18,800
I have a lot of friends there

267
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:21,940
And it's easy to make friends down here.

268
00:19:21,940 --> 00:19:23,920
Have you got a Cypriot friend

269
00:19:24,420 --> 00:19:26,180
So it is forever.

270
00:19:26,320 --> 00:19:28,820
There is so much to enjoy in Cyprus.

271
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:31,840
I love the people who live here.

272
00:19:32,320 --> 00:19:34,860
It is fantastic to live here.

273
00:19:34,860 --> 00:19:37,180
It's not that complicated, you take it as it is.

274
00:19:37,220 --> 00:19:38,640
It is not like in Sweden

275
00:19:38,700 --> 00:19:40,260
Where it is a bit strict.

276
00:19:40,740 --> 00:19:42,660
Without here it is a little mañana.

277
00:19:42,680 --> 00:19:46,800
After all, I can't get 35 pensioners together at the age of 75

278
00:19:47,020 --> 00:19:48,580
to a pub and throwing arrow

279
00:19:48,580 --> 00:19:50,140
Every Wednesday in Sweden.

280
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:51,540
It is completely impossible.

281
00:19:51,580 --> 00:19:52,700
But down here it goes.

282
00:19:53,060 --> 00:19:54,700
It's a completely different life down here.

283
00:20:53,120 --> 00:20:54,860
- Do you see yourself as a veteran?

284
00:20:55,220 --> 00:20:56,220
- Yes.

285
00:20:56,615 --> 00:20:57,615
I do it.

286
00:20:58,475 --> 00:20:59,635
Absolutely.

287
00:21:00,675 --> 00:21:02.965
I bear that with honor.

288
00:21:04,435 --> 00:21:06,745
Not many people get that chance.

289
00:21:07,740 --> 00:21:09,280
And as I said before so

290
00:21:09,740 --> 00:21:12,200
would I be happy to continue and do more battalions

291
00:21:13,360 --> 00:21:15,080
But the age took its right.

292
00:21:46,100 --> 00:21:50,220
