1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04.526
I love that the people are green is ....

2
00:00:04,526 --> 00:00:05,910
It was about it.

3
00:00:06,010 --> 00:00:08,689
Yes, people don't really know.

4
00:00:09,470 --> 00:00:11,789
Green is pretty underrated brown too I think.

5
00:00:11,890 --> 00:00:14,103
Brown and green i think are two very underrated colors

6
00:00:14,103 --> 00:00:15,680
When you keep on.

7
00:00:20,507 --> 00:00:24,000
It will never ever become original again, I can say.

8
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,239
No, not after I was here either.

9
00:00:26,340 --> 00:00:28,869
That said, my artist's ability extends so far

10
00:00:28,969 --> 00:00:32,380
That I can with distress and hardly draw a bar guy.

11
00:00:33,119 --> 00:00:36,110
Then it is extra fun that Kenneth comes here and drives on a little neighbor.

12
00:00:36,599 --> 00:00:40,460
But the waffle, stop blowing, it blows in all directions now all of a sudden.

13
00:00:40,560 --> 00:00:45,770
During work they have put down type especially the final finish

14
00:00:45,869 --> 00:00:47,610
Have they put down non -existent.

15
00:00:47,709 --> 00:00:49,652
That's what I like about this whole.

16
00:00:49,841 --> 00:00:53.049
Good morning, sleep well?

17
00:00:53,049 --> 00:00:56,610
Yeah i wake up in the middle of the night when my brain starts planning

18
00:00:57,669 --> 00:00:59.669
Before day two here.

19
00:00:59,950 --> 00:01:03,569
So yeah, i was awake for an hour to there in the middle of the night

20
00:01:03,669 --> 00:01:07.720
At half past four an hour ago I fell asleep again.

21
00:01:08,269 --> 00:01:09.860
And you kept falling asleep when we had dinner yesterday.

22
00:01:09,959 --> 00:01:12,550
Yes, I was well tired so I leaned against the box.

23
00:01:12,650 --> 00:01:15,270
Then I felt that now my eyes are starting to flutter

24
00:01:15,370 --> 00:01:17,060
Now it's time to go up and rest a little.

25
00:01:17,160 --> 00:01:18,470
You had a long time yesterday.

26
00:01:18,569 --> 00:01:22,779
Yeah, I did the foundation and got pretty much

27
00:01:22,879 --> 00:01:25,279
Of the lines too, but there is some left, absolutely.

28
00:01:25,957 --> 00:01:27,930
It's the fun left now, so to speak.

29
00:01:28,029 --> 00:01:31,750
The motives and some text and these things that I should do.

30
00:01:32,099 --> 00:01:34,449
Will still take eight ten hours anyway.

31
00:01:34,800 --> 00:01:37.540
Yes, it will probably take this all day before it's done.

32
00:01:38,290 --> 00:01:40,480
Although this time we'll probably try to pause a little in the middle of Dan

33
00:01:40,580 --> 00:01:43,589
And have lunch so you don't get completely spinning in your head.

34
00:01:43,589 --> 00:01:46,090
It's not a stupid idea. Andreas works today.

35
00:01:46,190 --> 00:01:49,020
Yes he is not there and I think that is great fun

36
00:01:49,120 --> 00:01:52,839
And he will not come and look at the car until it is done.

37
00:01:53,069 --> 00:01:54,700
No matter when he quits.

38
00:01:54,800 --> 00:01:56,779
So it's very fun I think.

39
00:01:56,779 --> 00:02:01.035
So then we get to see his reaction becomes like "pimp my ride" when he comes later.

40
00:02:07,459 --> 00:02:09.459
Should you reveal what to do?

41
00:02:09,589 --> 00:02:12,149
Yes he talks about that he wanted something

42
00:02:12,250 --> 00:02:16,609
that type was a bit of a military

43
00:02:16,609 --> 00:02:20,029
And more military than bombers shark teeth.

44
00:02:20,130 --> 00:02:21,579
I don't think so.

45
00:02:21,679 --> 00:02:23,669
Do not have to drive otherwise.

46
00:02:23,770 --> 00:02:25,519
You drive something really cool.

47
00:02:25,619 --> 00:02:26,949
I think it's pretty cool.

48
00:02:27,050 --> 00:02:30,669
Unfortunately there are very many who make very weird shark teeth

49
00:02:30,770 --> 00:02:33,689
on the side of the car by type so far or something like that

50
00:02:33,789 --> 00:02:35,789
Where you buy decal at Wish.

51
00:02:36,500 --> 00:02:38,059
It is not very nice simply.

52
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:41,419
I think a lot in that you simply have to draw it up.

53
00:02:42,470 --> 00:02:44,470
Why do you paint with chalk?

54
00:02:44,619 --> 00:02:48,970
Then I get a temporary painting to begin with.

55
00:02:50,729 --> 00:02:54,899
I want to be happy with what I do first.

56
00:02:58,009 --> 00:03:00.009
Sketch up as well.

57
00:03:00,479 --> 00:03:02.830
Just look at a picture for inspiration.

58
00:03:04,070 --> 00:03:06.070
After all, it will be very own now.

59
00:03:06,320 --> 00:03:08,320
Walking and painting straight on this?

60
00:03:08,320 --> 00:03:10,869
Yes it does. Then you just wipe off.

61
00:03:10,970 --> 00:03:13,199
It can get a little messy sometimes, but do you have a lot of color

62
00:03:13,300 --> 00:03:15,129
So then it is no problem to paint over chalk.

63
00:03:15,229 --> 00:03:16,599
Spray or get that with pencil.

64
00:03:16,699 --> 00:03:19,089
It will be mostly with a pen and possibly a little color.

65
00:03:19,190 --> 00:03:22.559
I thought it should be some highlights with color with spray cans

66
00:03:23,770 --> 00:03:26,720
And then it should be shaded around too.

67
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:28,919
But first I do these stuff now as well.

68
00:03:29,070 --> 00:03:31,399
So it will probably be interesting.

69
00:03:31,869 --> 00:03:35,294
Should start by pulling up with white or white lines I think

70
00:03:35,294 --> 00:03:38,259
Then the teeth will be quite bright.

71
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:41,360
At least it is good with them as a starting position.

72
00:03:41,539 --> 00:03:43,419
Try to follow the car's shapes instead.

73
00:03:43,419 --> 00:03:46,069
I think I should. About the same on the other side as well.

74
00:03:46,169 --> 00:03:46,809
It's interesting.

75
00:03:46,910 --> 00:03:48,629
But I start with this one and then I know was how

76
00:03:48,729 --> 00:03:50,729
I'll start from a second then.

77
00:03:51,350 --> 00:03:53,350
Then it is only copy that applies.

78
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:56,649
So stand and spray a car goes pretty fast,

79
00:03:57,410 --> 00:04:00.669
It's all else then when you have to sit and watch and think

80
00:04:00,770 --> 00:04:03.869
And then it is good to have some time.

81
00:04:04,220 --> 00:04:07.080
Because now I want it to be right.

82
00:04:07,630 --> 00:04:09.839
When I made the starting position I don't want to have to hold on

83
00:04:09,940 --> 00:04:12,759
And then paint over and redo and such things.

84
00:04:12,860 --> 00:04:14,049
It's not so fun.

85
00:04:14,149 --> 00:04:17,170
There will be decent teeth on half the car.

86
00:04:19,070 --> 00:04:22,850
It is a 15 millimeter cape.

87
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:28.009
It is quite rounded when they are very sharp edges from the beginning,

88
00:04:28,109 --> 00:04:30,209
But it is softened quite quickly by the color.

89
00:04:30,529 --> 00:04:33,729
The best thing about these can turn on them so they become too soft,

90
00:04:33,829 --> 00:04:35,630
Then you just turn them over.

91
00:04:35,730 --> 00:04:37,389
Now I'm going to make my eye right now.

92
00:04:37,489 --> 00:04:41,589
The eye that should always be a little angry.

93
00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:45,459
But I just pull the first lines now then that lime falls away.

94
00:04:46,399 --> 00:04:48.009
Sitting so loosely.

95
00:04:48,109 --> 00:04:49,720
How is the color sitting?

96
00:04:49,820 --> 00:04:50,779
Sits as well as any.

97
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:55,079
As good as this color black in so that I buy replenishment.

98
00:04:55,609 --> 00:04:58,130
Instead of buying new pens, I buy refill

99
00:04:58,230 --> 00:05:00,222
Because you can change the cape.

100
00:05:00,222 --> 00:05:02.639
And then you do this only when you have to change

101
00:05:02,739 --> 00:05:07.079
Or replenish color just when the other direction so.

102
00:05:08,319 --> 00:05:10,346
Then you pick off and pour down just here.

103
00:05:10,346 --> 00:05:12.019
It's so good so you fill them.

104
00:05:12,119 --> 00:05:13,709
Is it just drive on.

105
00:05:13,809 --> 00:05:15,949
I like that the car is really flat then.

106
00:05:16,049 --> 00:05:18,049
Or not.

107
00:05:18,200 --> 00:05:22,510
Is so easy to make straight lines when the car is like this.

108
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:25,320
Here it is simple, but when you go over the moldings and stuff

109
00:05:25,420 --> 00:05:27,700
So it gets a little worrying sometimes.

110
00:05:28,649 --> 00:05:31,470
I like your pose too, will be good for my back then.

111
00:05:31,859 --> 00:05:33,389
This is much better to sit like this

112
00:05:33,489 --> 00:05:35,489
than to do as I did before.

113
00:05:35,649 --> 00:05:37,769
Then I'm actually good at moving me instead

114
00:05:37,869 --> 00:05:38,989
to keep on turning your back.

115
00:05:39,089 --> 00:05:41,239
It is the worst thing you can do when you are like this.

116
00:05:41,339 --> 00:05:44,720
That is the best thing about Easter pen, that it covers

117
00:05:44,820 --> 00:05:46,575
After all, all colors

118
00:05:46,575 --> 00:05:48,442
SU sees the chalk disappear immediately.

119
00:05:50,140 --> 00:05:52,140
It was a big line from the beginning.

120
00:05:53,209 --> 00:05:54,380
Now they are starting to look for something.

121
00:05:54,480 --> 00:05:56,480
Maybe look really messy though.

122
00:05:58,350 --> 00:06:00,790
It is not really clear you can say.

123
00:06:00,890 --> 00:06:06.029
I went without a clear lacquer but it can do quite well anyway

124
00:06:06,130 --> 00:06:10,350
And it's like so damn cool as it is because they do so well anyway.

125
00:06:11,329 --> 00:06:13,329
It's hard to cover right here.

126
00:06:14,980 --> 00:06:19,106
It is such a gross repair that has been there so it is not possible to paint

127
00:06:20,666 --> 00:06:23,109
Sick that it has dried in minutes.

128
00:06:23,209 --> 00:06:26,980
Now I can wipe the chalk stuff.

129
00:06:26,980 --> 00:06:30,149
Now we're going to put shading behind and I will also put over the teeth

130
00:06:30,250 --> 00:06:33,630
So that they are toned down a little so it's not so damn white.

131
00:06:34,010 --> 00:06:37,959
This is like you just put a shadow.

132
00:06:38,059 --> 00:06:40,910
Now I use regular CAP because it is quite fluff.

133
00:06:41,010 --> 00:06:43,669
It flows out but adds no sharp lines.

134
00:06:43,769 --> 00:06:45,769
Or something like that.

135
00:06:47,420 --> 00:06:51,839
But when you mix it like this you see that it looks

136
00:06:51,940 --> 00:06:53,940
Like a shading around.

137
00:07:02,980 --> 00:07:06,190
You have to wait until the wind has been moaning for two and a half seconds.

138
00:07:06,829 --> 00:07:08.829
Then you can pull.

139
00:07:09,179 --> 00:07:11,179
You see the difference

140
00:07:18,640 --> 00:07:22,029
here. There is so little needed to really get it there.

141
00:07:26,089 --> 00:07:28,089
You should have a mask huh?

142
00:07:28,609 --> 00:07:32,440
Yes, now it was actually so that it was standing still here the air

143
00:07:40,047 --> 00:07:41,144
Empty!

144
00:07:41,144 --> 00:07:44,300
A shark always has teeth that are growing out.

145
00:07:44,704 --> 00:07:47.704
And so that's why sitting in between.

146
00:07:55,399 --> 00:07:57,399
That was not stupid.

147
00:07:58,540 --> 00:08:00,470
It got cool.

148
00:08:00,570 --> 00:08:02.194
And so gets the same on the other side?

149
00:08:02,194 --> 00:08:03,750
It will be.

150
00:08:03,850 --> 00:08:05.850
So transparent black.

151
00:08:06,380 --> 00:08:08.880
Got to actually learn it this week, how good it can be.

152
00:08:08,980 --> 00:08:10,880
I was one is perfect as well.

153
00:08:10,980 --> 00:08:15,200
To do this, ie here so that otherwise I usually drive with regular black.

154
00:08:16,570 --> 00:08:20,179
The smallest you press wrong, then you are completely black instead.

155
00:08:20,480 --> 00:08:22,229
But I don't want that.

156
00:08:22,329 --> 00:08:24,329
Want like shadows.

157
00:08:26,410 --> 00:08:29,149
I eat so useful when I am working here.

158
00:08:29,709 --> 00:08:31,559
I really think about food all the time.

159
00:08:31,660 --> 00:08:32,910
Or not.

160
00:08:33,010 --> 00:08:37,020
Finally, I know why is yes spicy and tough?

161
00:08:37,119 --> 00:08:39,817
What is I fainting when I get up?

162
00:08:39,817 --> 00:08:41,880
Just that, I have to eat.

163
00:08:41,919 --> 00:08:43,520
Motor geek lunch there.

164
00:08:43,619 --> 00:08:44,670
It is right.

165
00:08:44,770 --> 00:08:47,659
That's it. Costs to be on top.

166
00:08:49,900 --> 00:08:54,150
This is a special green that sits on the heap.

167
00:08:54,390 --> 00:08:57.440
Thick green light. There it ran.

168
00:08:57,539 --> 00:08:58,750
Are you trying to save what?

169
00:08:58,849 --> 00:09:01.820
No. Part of in some way I think.

170
00:09:02,020 --> 00:09:03,530
Don't you get stressed by the run?

171
00:09:03,630 --> 00:09:04.666
No.

172
00:09:05,273 --> 00:09:06.607
It's as it is.

173
00:09:06,843 --> 00:09:09.239
Now I start with a little highlight stuff.

174
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,470
Acid green.

175
00:09:14,570 --> 00:09:16,570
Yes, acid green.

176
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:26,520
There it was green and green and green.

177
00:09:26,619 --> 00:09:29,280
Yes, gray and gray and black.

178
00:09:29,820 --> 00:09:30,410
Yes.

179
00:09:30,510 --> 00:09:32,739
Where is pink? And ketchup?

180
00:09:33,049 --> 00:09:34,780
Ketchup is coming.

181
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:35,970
I have been waiting for ketchup.

182
00:09:36,070 --> 00:09:39,400
Yes, I think like this if a shark has big fangs,

183
00:09:40,119 --> 00:09:42,119
What is taken then?

184
00:09:42,619 --> 00:09:43,780
You wear things in.

185
00:09:43,880 --> 00:09:44,670
What then?

186
00:09:44,770 --> 00:09:47,260
Blood. Just right.

187
00:09:47,780 --> 00:09:51.090
But it's like the Final Touch when you have chewed up the buns.

188
00:09:51,239 --> 00:09:55.040
If it is when you make it really fun, it is important not to stand in the headwind

189
00:09:55,140 --> 00:09:57,584
When you throw red ...

190
00:09:58,284 --> 00:09:59.940
Then you have ketchup all over your face.

191
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:02,320
Since we did the hill.

192
00:10:02,590 --> 00:10:05,940
Yes, and in between the hymes and before we start recording this project

193
00:10:06,039 --> 00:10:07.600
So it has received a lot of requests.

194
00:10:07,700 --> 00:10:13,919
Yes, I have made a pickles, a Silverado 1500 from 2000 and a pretty big one too.

195
00:10:14,090 --> 00:10:16,690
There was a lot to work on, but I did that completely differently.

196
00:10:16,789 --> 00:10:18,619
It wasn't that I pulled such just lines

197
00:10:18,719 --> 00:10:21,360
Without I made the whole body looked

198
00:10:21,460 --> 00:10:22,300
as it was made in sheet metal.

199
00:10:22,400 --> 00:10:25,890
We even sat real plates on all screen edges.

200
00:10:26,260 --> 00:10:28,750
So they were really redone.

201
00:10:28,849 --> 00:10:30,190
This one I came up with myself.

202
00:10:30,289 --> 00:10:33,480
Many times I need when I drive toward edges

203
00:10:33,580 --> 00:10:35,580
And stuff when I spray.

204
00:10:36,169 --> 00:10:37,960
Then I just put it against spraying.

205
00:10:38,059 --> 00:10:41,979
Especially when I did these who looked like plates on this chevan.

206
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:43,680
You use this all the time.

207
00:10:43,780 --> 00:10:46,210
It was really sunny from the beginning as well as

208
00:10:46,450 --> 00:10:48,450
The end result was really cool.

209
00:10:48,549 --> 00:10:52,200
There I used all the imagination I had and some more.

210
00:10:52,520 --> 00:10:54,250
But I thought I saw when you paint on some bus.

211
00:10:54,349 --> 00:10:56,300
Yes, it is a new project.

212
00:10:56,400 --> 00:11:00,970
It is a very good friend who has a bus he has done.

213
00:11:01,070 --> 00:11:02,420
She did the order last winter.

214
00:11:02,520 --> 00:11:05,430
I got some help from me and others and then I said that

215
00:11:05,530 --> 00:11:08.080
But God I'll fix it, we'll paint it there.

216
00:11:08,270 --> 00:11:10,050
Then the blue was underneath.

217
00:11:10,150 --> 00:11:12,434
Yes about up here earlier.

218
00:11:12,434 --> 00:11:17,230
So he wanted the black and but I want skulls and stuff etc

219
00:11:17,330 --> 00:11:22,090
In the 80s skull. He calls himself the pirate

220
00:11:22,190 --> 00:11:23,920
He has on his cars.

221
00:11:24,020 --> 00:11:25,130
He drives a truck.

222
00:11:25,229 --> 00:11:27,280
So I thought but god that's another friend

223
00:11:27,380 --> 00:11:29,580
Which is absolutely cruel at making skulls.

224
00:11:30,059 --> 00:11:32,920
So I start talking to him and he lit a lot on the idea.

225
00:11:33,020 --> 00:11:35,950
So last Wednesday we were in fact and burned

226
00:11:36,049 --> 00:11:40,250
On so he drove on a ten meter skull of the whole side.

227
00:11:42,030 --> 00:11:45,380
A giant skull with spider leg.

228
00:11:45,479 --> 00:11:47,270
So it is totally ouff!

229
00:11:47,369 --> 00:11:48,619
It's so cool!

230
00:11:48,719 --> 00:11:51.309
I have started running this kind of cartoon style

231
00:11:51,409 --> 00:11:56,630
With Acid Green actually against mold and white.

232
00:11:57,869 --> 00:11:58,710
What washing?

233
00:11:58,809 --> 00:12:02.909
I drive over the mold so it looks great so it was actually really cool.

234
00:12:03,229 --> 00:12:04,720
It looks really cool!

235
00:12:04,820 --> 00:12:06,540
You can see the front here now, I drew after all

236
00:12:06,640 --> 00:12:09.349
On the only thing I've done there as well.

237
00:12:09,590 --> 00:12:13,599
But here I have done so that this dark green instead

238
00:12:14,299 --> 00:12:16,299
And the other is light green on the outside.

239
00:12:17,270 --> 00:12:20,460
It's a bit like that blink to Amazon actually,

240
00:12:20,650 --> 00:12:22,030
Which has a barbecue six months.

241
00:12:22,130 --> 00:12:23,920
I think it was pretty cool this.

242
00:12:24,020 --> 00:12:26,400
It already looks a booklet on the hood so it doesn't matter.

243
00:12:26,500 --> 00:12:29,070
It is not that it is not visible if we say so.

244
00:12:29,599 --> 00:12:31,900
So now I drive with light gray.

245
00:12:32,989 --> 00:12:35,960
It is a very nice color that goes well against this.

246
00:12:36,530 --> 00:12:41,150
Yes, bright to the dark too so it as a shading.

247
00:12:41,909 --> 00:12:46,030
The gray was black and now I run with this

248
00:12:46,130 --> 00:12:48,270
So that it should contrast more.

249
00:12:54,280 --> 00:12:57,510
You have to find with small branches to be able to draw straight lines.

250
00:12:58,280 --> 00:13:00,289
You can take support for quite a lot of things.

251
00:13:05,500 --> 00:13:06.436
So.

252
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:09,299
God how beautiful it becomes.

253
00:13:09,679 --> 00:13:11,480
Now have you felt that today it went according to plan?

254
00:13:11,580 --> 00:13:13,580
Yes God yes.

255
00:13:14,440 --> 00:13:16,172
No conflict in your head either?

256
00:13:16,172 --> 00:13:19,584
No, I'm one such so I can adapt all the time too.

257
00:13:20,059 --> 00:13:23,289
I have everything, do not have to be black or white.

258
00:13:23,469 --> 00:13:24,850
Or it should not be a nail.

259
00:13:24,950 --> 00:13:26,559
Nothing is nailway.

260
00:13:26,659 --> 00:13:27,680
Nothing is perfect.

261
00:13:27,780 --> 00:13:29,780
Nothing is nailway.

262
00:13:30,349 --> 00:13:33,869
I've never been afraid to think about it.

263
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:37,008
Many people think I am very, very scared

264
00:13:37,008 --> 00:13:39,049
To think about when they are doing something.

265
00:13:39,229 --> 00:13:43,349
Because then control disappears as they lose control.

266
00:13:44,090 --> 00:13:47,840
I am never afraid to feel now we do differently.

267
00:13:48,059 --> 00:13:50,059
We do this in a different way.

268
00:13:50,330 --> 00:13:53,690
Because I believe a lot in this, that it is better to think like this

269
00:13:53,789 --> 00:13:58,150
And adapt where in instead of running around and worrying.

270
00:13:58,250 --> 00:14:01.510
Most people seem to do that nowadays as well.

271
00:14:01,679 --> 00:14:03,790
And especially when it comes to creative work.

272
00:14:03,890 --> 00:14:07,030
Just adapt.

273
00:14:07,919 --> 00:14:10,900
There are no problems, there are only lots of opportunities

274
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,599
As you can do differently.

275
00:14:14,130 --> 00:14:16,130
That's how I usually think.

276
00:14:17,780 --> 00:14:19,070
That is an adaptation.

277
00:14:19,169 --> 00:14:20,270
Oh, it ran a little.

278
00:14:20,369 --> 00:14:22,369
Well what a nice thing I feel.

279
00:14:23,190 --> 00:14:26,210
It doesn't make things uglier because they're not exact.

280
00:14:26,309 --> 00:14:27,800
Straight Lines as well.

281
00:14:27,900 --> 00:14:31,039
As you have driven with a fucking ruler as well.

282
00:14:32,549 --> 00:14:34,960
If you want such stuff, you should not go to me, he says.

283
00:14:35,099 --> 00:14:38,770
However, do you want stuff with a little more soul and improvisation

284
00:14:39,070 --> 00:14:42,820
And as some say, a little more chaos, then it's fun to go to me.

285
00:14:42,960 --> 00:14:44,960
How to get in touch with you?

286
00:14:45,140 --> 00:14:46,130
I know you, though.

287
00:14:46,229 --> 00:14:48,479
Yes, I have my Youtube channel RBCorten.

288
00:14:48,580 --> 00:14:52,230
Then I am on Instagram too so it is easiest.

289
00:14:52,330 --> 00:14:54,830
I am very active at Rat Basted Crew Sweden as well.

290
00:14:55,820 --> 00:14:58.847
There I put up almost daily.

291
00:14:59,390 --> 00:15:00.850
I have run the boxes on this too.

292
00:15:00,950 --> 00:15:02.790
Let's see what he says about that.

293
00:15:02,890 --> 00:15:04,290
It will be fun.

294
00:15:04,390 --> 00:15:06,820
I think it's shit bell to drive on the boxes

295
00:15:06,969 --> 00:15:09,520
Just because it really doesn't cover over something

296
00:15:09,619 --> 00:15:11,619
that is dangerous or something.

297
00:15:12,299 --> 00:15:13,250
So that's really.

298
00:15:13,349 --> 00:15:16,300
One cannot say that it is unauthorized drawing

299
00:15:16,400 --> 00:15:18,400
Because then you don't look, yea right?

300
00:15:19,799 --> 00:15:22,809
You can put decals anyway, but you can't pull

301
00:15:22,909 --> 00:15:25,559
Some lines on a box.

302
00:15:25,659 --> 00:15:27,360
It sounds totally sick.

303
00:15:27,460 --> 00:15:28,650
So we'll see what they think.

304
00:15:28,750 --> 00:15:31,016
Here in Lidköping.

305
00:15:31,166 --> 00:15:33,166
It is going to be fun

306
00:15:36,359 --> 00:15:41,050
This is ketchup when I spray on the brush

307
00:15:41,567 --> 00:15:44,669
A good color when you want some effects.

308
00:15:50,969 --> 00:15:52,440
Written on the rear screen.

309
00:15:52,539 --> 00:15:54,530
Yes it sat.

310
00:15:54,630 --> 00:15:56,170
Damn a lot of red color it will be here behind.

311
00:15:56,270 --> 00:15:58,600
Yes it does nothing.

312
00:15:58,600 --> 00:16:00.820
It sprays blood and jaws on them here.

313
00:16:02,429 --> 00:16:03,230
What are you going to do now?

314
00:16:03,330 --> 00:16:06.659
Now it's time for Hologram Glitter. Glitter?

315
00:16:06,659 --> 00:16:08,360
Yes, that's clear lacquer too.

316
00:16:08,460 --> 00:16:10,430
Both clear lacquer and glitter and hologram.

317
00:16:10,530 --> 00:16:14,770
This means that you have all the colors so it gets cool.

318
00:16:15,929 --> 00:16:18,570
As much as ends up on the boxes when it blows so much.

319
00:16:19,159 --> 00:16:21,159
But there is good pressure in this.

320
00:16:23,539 --> 00:16:25,539
Oh what a difference right away.

321
00:16:26,929 --> 00:16:29,890
Protects the shark teeth a bit too, it is clear varnish in this.

322
00:16:29,989 --> 00:16:33,559
This so mixed with clear lacquer that it is a form of clear lacquer

323
00:16:33,659 --> 00:16:35,659
Can you say that has lots of glitter in.

324
00:16:42,559 --> 00:16:44,461
It is glitter the effect is very clear.

325
00:16:44,461 --> 00:16:47,280
Yes God yes, it is damn clear. Check out the rear view mirror.

326
00:16:47,619 --> 00:16:49,659
Then the gray darkens a little neighbor too.

327
00:16:50,330 --> 00:16:51,710
Do you start feeling ready?

328
00:16:51,809 --> 00:16:56,440
Yes, you can say that I have been more attractive. Ahh ....

329
00:16:59,669 --> 00:17:01.669
Now it is legitimate to have real old man.

330
00:17:01,820 --> 00:17:03,680
Yeah now it's really

331
00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:05.829
Aaaaaaahhh.

332
00:17:09,930 --> 00:17:12.569
And I've just called Andreas when he's on his way down.

333
00:17:12,680 --> 00:17:14,750
Yes, cool.

334
00:17:15,020 --> 00:17:16,219
What do you think he will think?

335
00:17:16,319 --> 00:17:18,109
I hope for positive actually.

336
00:17:18,209 --> 00:17:21,630
I think it looks very different and cool and fun.

337
00:17:21,800 --> 00:17:24,109
Damn it was cool.

338
00:17:24,209 --> 00:17:26,209
I'm totally.

339
00:17:27,579 --> 00:17:29,200
I have a hard time finding words.

340
00:17:29,300 --> 00:17:34,439
It is not possible to imagine the end result when you only see the colors.

341
00:17:34,819 --> 00:17:38,410
No no. Just a cardboard box with jars.

342
00:17:38,510 --> 00:17:42,189
Yes, so the chopping teeth were really bald.

343
00:17:42,500 --> 00:17:46,469
Yes, and then blood was sprayed on the eyes.

344
00:17:46,569 --> 00:17:48,916
Thus, the waistband of everything.

345
00:17:48,916 --> 00:17:50,306
Ha said, it runs and flows.

346
00:17:50,306 --> 00:17:52,400
It is quiet.

347
00:17:52,560 --> 00:17:54,140
Douglas thought it was very busy.

348
00:17:54,239 --> 00:17:55,836
It's quiet, I said.

349
00:17:55,836 --> 00:17:58,060
It scratched in the body.

350
00:17:58,160 --> 00:18:00.889
Yes, it did. It's art.

351
00:18:01,089 --> 00:18:02.859
Absolutely okay with rinings that.

352
00:18:02,959 --> 00:18:04,359
It also fits in.

353
00:18:04,459 --> 00:18:07,280
Which makes it look like he is crying green gallow.

354
00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:11,329
Yes, you see it has been a part of instead.

355
00:18:11,777 --> 00:18:13,777
Yes yes yes.

356
00:18:16,869 --> 00:18:18,489
Yes.

357
00:18:18,589 --> 00:18:24,270
I love that the people green is uh ..... it was about it.

358
00:18:24,369 --> 00:18:26,950
Yes people don't really know.

359
00:18:27,050 --> 00:18:29,150
Green is quite underrated and brown I think.

360
00:18:29,250 --> 00:18:31,849
Brown and green I think get very underrated colors

361
00:18:31,949 --> 00:18:32,920
When you keep on.

362
00:18:33,020 --> 00:18:35,489
The boxes got really cool and I like that.

363
00:18:35,630 --> 00:18:39,540
It matched as well as the terrace in the back. It's just glue it

364
00:18:39,640 --> 00:18:40,960
So that it sits as well.

365
00:18:41,060 --> 00:18:42,825
What do you like most of Kenneth has done?

366
00:18:42,825 --> 00:18:47,290
It is not possible to describe words that are just trying to bring in all this.

367
00:18:47,390 --> 00:18:49,449
It's so damn awesome.

368
00:18:49,589 --> 00:18:51,589
He has done good jobs.

369
00:18:53,119 --> 00:18:56,890
I know he is good, but this is far beyond my expectation.

370
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:57,960
As I saw it yesterday.

371
00:18:58,060 --> 00:19:01.060
I could never have imagined that.

372
00:19:01,160 --> 00:19:02,710
The final result.

373
00:19:02,810 --> 00:19:06,239
Now he is really customs that I wanted what I wanted it.

374
00:19:06,770 --> 00:19:09,680
Now he lives up to my goal with it.

375
00:19:09,928 --> 00:19:11,660
I am more than satisfied.

376
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:15,420
This is far above what I could have dreamed

377
00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:16,400
about at all.

378
00:19:16,500 --> 00:19:18,310
But now it is visible.

379
00:19:18,410 --> 00:19:20,200
If it didn't do it before.

380
00:19:20,300 --> 00:19:22,027
Hologram clear lacquer.

381
00:19:22,879 --> 00:19:25,503
So the glitter it becomes glitter directly.

382
00:19:26,060 --> 00:19:26,989
It's dry.

383
00:19:26,989 --> 00:19:28,060
It's drier.

384
00:19:28,189 --> 00:19:29,452
It's dry here.

385
00:19:29,452 --> 00:19:31,030
It's not raining away.

386
00:19:31,030 --> 00:19:31,880
I've put it on.

387
00:19:31,979 --> 00:19:33,979
Then it blew like that.

388
00:19:34,339 --> 00:19:36,719
But it blew less on this page than the other.

389
00:19:36,910 --> 00:19:40,590
When the sun is shining on it, it glitters on well.

390
00:19:41,449 --> 00:19:44,109
It is one of those where one can stand and stare in a long time

391
00:19:44,209 --> 00:19:46,099
And discover new things all the time.

392
00:19:46,199 --> 00:19:50,750
Will be interesting to see them when we have our hits next Thursday

393
00:19:51,689 --> 00:19:53,689
Exhibit it and see people's reaction.

394
00:19:53,800 --> 00:19:58,260
Set me a little and let people react to it.

395
00:19:58,849 --> 00:20:00.849
You will pick around tonight.

396
00:20:01,339 --> 00:20:03,339
It will probably be a turn. Yes.

397
00:20:03,500 --> 00:20:05,079
I would sign.

398
00:20:05,079 --> 00:20:06,710
So this is the first time.

399
00:20:06,810 --> 00:20:08,270
Signs a car.

400
00:20:08,369 --> 00:20:10,119
Now we are ready Kenneth. Yes.

401
00:20:10,219 --> 00:20:15,520
Now it is probably more well 40 plus miles home only then it is quiet.

402
00:20:15,770 --> 00:20:17,500
I'm so tired that I don't know ....

403
00:20:17,599 --> 00:20:19,339
Then we are two.

404
00:20:19,439 --> 00:20:20,700
But we are hard and tough.

405
00:20:20,800 --> 00:20:22,800
We bite together and then we drive anyway.

406
00:20:24,530 --> 00:20:25,339
We do it like this.

407
00:20:25,439 --> 00:20:27,650
We are heard when Doc is ready.

408
00:20:27,780 --> 00:20:29,780
Yes, and then we look at it.

409
00:20:30,130 --> 00:20:34,589
If I feel right, it will show up several things.

410
00:20:35,420 --> 00:20:36,989
The risk is imminent.

411
00:20:37,089 --> 00:20:39,089
Or the chance is great you can say.

412
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,000
The chance is great.

413
00:20:42,229 --> 00:20:43,790
And great fun to do here with you.

414
00:20:43,890 --> 00:20:47,280
Absolutely! We must say on a look!

415
00:20:47,320 --> 00:20:49,345
Have a good one! See you later!
