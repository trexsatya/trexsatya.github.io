1
00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:34.680
After this meeting, nothing will be the same.

2
00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:40.080
For in the stock boats there is a load that will change life in fundamentals -

3
00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:44.320
- For all future generations here in the Nordic countries.

4
00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:54.880
We are in the Stone Age.

5
00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:59.520
A period of over 10,000 years, then the first people to come here -

6
00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:05.320
- Must adapt to a whimsical and unpredictable climate.

7
00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:10.920
Archaeological finds tell of a woman's life as a stone -age hunter ...

8
00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:17.120
... and about others who come here to become farmers.

9
00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:19.840
These are the first residents -

10
00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:25.600
- Which creates the foundation of the country we live in today.

11
00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:32.400
This is the story of our country.

12
00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:37.760
About the people and forces that have shaped it -

13
00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:42.320
- Endure from the ice age until our days.

14
00:02:56.240 --> 00:03:00.240
This is the story of Sweden.

15
00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:17.400
The first people to set foot here do it to hunt.

16
00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:22.560
They have followed the animals north and meet a whole new landscape.

17
00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:25.720
Until recently, the land was unavailable -

18
00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:32.120
- Deputy embedded under a huge ice cover, over 1,000 meters thick.

19
00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:34.280
Inland ice.

20
00:04:40.760 --> 00:04:45.880
The last ice age lasted over 100,000 years.

21
00:04:46.040 --> 00:04:49.920
But then something happens that changes the spread of ice.

22
00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:53.000
I.a.
 This is how the slope of the earth's axis changes -

23
00:04:53.160 --> 00:04:57.480
–And 14,500 years ago it gets warmer -

24
00:04:57.640 --> 00:05:01.480
- And the ice is starting to melt.

25
00:05:09.280 --> 00:05:14.600
One might think that the landscape at the icy is dead and barren -

26
00:05:14.760 --> 00:05:20.640
- But it is also extremely fertile, and we quickly get flora and fauna.

27
00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:24.400
This is people very interested in -

28
00:05:24.560 --> 00:05:29.880
- So the icy is something that people follow, you might say.

29
00:05:34.560 --> 00:05:39.720
The first people to come here are dark -skinned with blue eyes.

30
00:05:39.880 --> 00:05:44.080
They are hunters who follow the prey animals into Sweden -

31
00:05:44.240 --> 00:05:47.280
- To the new hunting grounds.

32
00:05:50.280 --> 00:05:52.960
You move above great distances.

33
00:05:53.120 --> 00:05:57.640
It can be about today's Germany, up to southern Sweden -

34
00:05:57.800 --> 00:06:02.680
–And maybe even
 Central Sweden.
 It is thus thousands of kilometers.

35
00:06:04.200 --> 00:06:07.960
The hunters can search for several days on the huge expanses -

36
00:06:08.120 --> 00:06:11.760
- Whey they manage to trap an animal.

37
00:06:14.400 --> 00:06:19.400
They often chased in family groups, and in some situations it was required -

38
00:06:19.560 --> 00:06:24.520
- That everyone who could help - men, women and young people.

39
00:06:24.680 --> 00:06:29.800
It was a great collective work, and it was about sneaking forward.

40
00:06:29.960 --> 00:06:35.960
You had hand signs to signal to each other and not scare the prey.

41
00:06:55.040 --> 00:06:59.160
You are several people, certainly also dogs, who drive the animals -

42
00:06:59.320 --> 00:07:02.360
–Up on tops or down in watercours -

43
00:07:02.520 --> 00:07:07.120
- Where it is easier to take the animals and where they cannot escape.

44
00:07:13.080 --> 00:07:17.320
One must remember that these people were hugely vulnerable.

45
00:07:17.480 --> 00:07:23.800
It was a gigantic tundra landscape with many miles to the nearest neighbors.

46
00:07:23.960 --> 00:07:26.360
No mistakes may be committed.

47
00:07:26.520 --> 00:07:30.680
It is precisely on the edge that you can manage in this environment.

48
00:07:30.840 --> 00:07:35.960
So these people were incredibly dependent on each other.

49
00:07:45.160 --> 00:07:51.240
The hunters moving in the landscape leave tracks that we can see today.

50
00:07:55.160 --> 00:08:00.520
The earliest finds from people in Sweden are different tools of flint.

51
00:08:00.680 --> 00:08:05.400
Here, for example, we find scraps used in leather preparation -

52
00:08:05.560 --> 00:08:09.360
- But also lace from arrows or spears.

53
00:08:18.360 --> 00:08:24.920
We know from historical hunter society that the story was incredibly important:

54
00:08:25.080 --> 00:08:31.560
What you have been through how the prey animals behaved, how hunting methods worked.

55
00:08:31.720 --> 00:08:36.520
This was an incredibly important way to pass on knowledge.

56
00:08:36.680 --> 00:08:40.720
The story is also a way to build up social cohabitation.

57
00:08:40.880 --> 00:08:44.000
You can tell amazing, exciting stories.

58
00:08:44.160 --> 00:08:48.000
In larger investigations, it has been possible to find - -

59
00:08:48.160 --> 00:08:53.160
- The storyteller among hunter people in the world has more children than the average.

60
00:08:53.320 --> 00:08:57.240
So, you have social success if you are good at telling.

61
00:09:00.680 --> 00:09:05.080
The first hunters only come here in the summers to hunt.

62
00:09:05.240 --> 00:09:11.400
The winters are too cold, so the rest of the year they live down in Germany.

63
00:09:11.560 --> 00:09:14.760
But it will soon change.

64
00:09:21.240 --> 00:09:27.560
As the inland ice melts away, our Swedish nature begins to see the light of day.

65
00:09:53.840 --> 00:09:58.120
When the weight of ice disappears, the land surface -

66
00:09:58.280 --> 00:10:03.200
- And we get a land rise that is going on in large parts of Sweden today.

67
00:10:03.360 --> 00:10:09.720
Gradually, the Northern European landscape emerges, as we know it.

68
00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:38.600
At this time, the trees are attached to our latitudes, and begin to spread.

69
00:10:38.760 --> 00:10:43.520
And where sly and shrubs grow up soon form birch and pine -

70
00:10:43.680 --> 00:10:48.400
- A brand new landscape for man to live and live in.

71
00:10:53.920 --> 00:10:59.120
With the new landscape, major cultural changes are also taking place.

72
00:10:59.280 --> 00:11:05.200
Now more people are starting to come in, who stay for longer periods.

73
00:11:07.040 --> 00:11:12.040
The young Swedish forest provides both protection and building materials.

74
00:11:13.680 --> 00:11:20.040
As the climate gets warmer, Sweden gets its first permanent residents.

75
00:11:20.200 --> 00:11:25.720
They spread into southern Sweden and up along the Norwegian coast.

76
00:11:25.880 --> 00:11:30.520
Man becomes more resident on the coast, inside the inland.

77
00:11:30.680 --> 00:11:36.680
From now, Sweden can in many ways be said to be colonized for real.

78
00:11:50.160 --> 00:11:54.520
With the help of DNA analyzes we have been able to see that these people-

79
00:11:54.680 --> 00:11:59.800
- Had quite much darker complexion than is common here today.

80
00:11:59.960 --> 00:12:03.880
They were also blue -eyed to a large extent.

81
00:12:07.560 --> 00:12:12.520
But the people who moved here from the south are not alone.

82
00:12:12.680 --> 00:12:17.720
For at about the same time, others who are also looking for new hunting grounds - come.

83
00:12:17.880 --> 00:12:21.880
- And places to stay.
 And they come from the north -

84
00:12:22.040 --> 00:12:26.360
- From areas that are today Finland and Russia.

85
00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:44.360
They look a little different from the southern group.

86
00:12:44.520 --> 00:12:48.680
There are individuals with lighter hair and individuals with darker hair.

87
00:12:48.840 --> 00:12:54.120
And at the skin pigmentation level, it is average slightly lighter pigmentation -

88
00:12:54.280 --> 00:12:57.800
- Enta in the southern group.

89
00:13:09.280 --> 00:13:14.960
It seems that these people meet fairly quickly and have children -

90
00:13:15.120 --> 00:13:18.760
- What makes us get a mix in the look.

91
00:13:18.920 --> 00:13:23.440
But we are now starting to go towards a lighter pigmentation -

92
00:13:23.600 --> 00:13:27.480
- Among the people living in these areas.

93
00:13:32.120 --> 00:13:35.920
It will take many thousands of years and more migrations -

94
00:13:36.080 --> 00:13:41.720
- The Scandinavians get the skin color that is the dominant today.

95
00:13:43.280 --> 00:13:46.280
When people start living here all year -

96
00:13:46.440 --> 00:13:50.680
- A new chapter is being started in our history.

97
00:14:04.240 --> 00:14:09.880
They create settlements from Skåne to northern Norrland.

98
00:14:10.040 --> 00:14:16.200
They move across large areas, follow the animals and look for edible plants.

99
00:14:16.360 --> 00:14:21.640
They live both on the coast and inland, at streams and lakes.

100
00:14:21.800 --> 00:14:26.040
Interestingly, you get a colonization from the north.

101
00:14:26.200 --> 00:14:30.280
It is conceivable that the move to Norrland is happening quickly.

102
00:14:30.440 --> 00:14:34.000
Large areas become ice -free as the ice melts away.

103
00:14:34.160 --> 00:14:37.320
Excavations in recent years also show -

104
00:14:37.480 --> 00:14:42.440
- That you lived very close to the icy 10,000 years ago.

105
00:15:42.680 --> 00:15:47.360
This woman should forever enroll in Swedish history.

106
00:15:47.520 --> 00:15:54.560
Over 10,000 years ago, she lived near Österöd, outside Lysekil.

107
00:15:59.360 --> 00:16:03.960
And that's how she got her name: Österödskoman.

108
00:16:12.960 --> 00:16:18.480
Her skeleton gives a unique insight into how to live in the older Stone Age.

109
00:16:18.640 --> 00:16:24.760
She is dated to about 8,000 BC, ie 10,000 years ago.

110
00:16:29.240 --> 00:16:35.720
It is thus the most complete, oldest skeleton we have in Sweden.

111
00:17:08.080 --> 00:17:12.080
The early Stone Age hunters live together in family groups -

112
00:17:12.240 --> 00:17:15.520
- On 15-20 people.

113
00:17:29.080 --> 00:17:32.000
They are skilled hunters.

114
00:17:32.160 --> 00:17:35.000
And you will find a good place ...

115
00:17:35.160 --> 00:17:40.040
... then you settle down there and stay as long as there is food.

116
00:17:56.520 --> 00:18:01.200
The skeletons of the Österöds give us clues about the life she lived -

117
00:18:01.360 --> 00:18:04.440
- And what she looked like.

118
00:18:16.360 --> 00:18:20.200
From her skeleton we have managed to extract DNA.

119
00:18:20.360 --> 00:18:25.080
It makes us know quite a lot about hereditary diseases, how she looked out -

120
00:18:25.240 --> 00:18:29.360
- And how she is related to other groups and individuals at that time.

121
00:18:29.520 --> 00:18:32.320
She is athletic and quite long.

122
00:18:32.480 --> 00:18:37.720
When we reconstruct her body length, she becomes up to 170 cm.

123
00:18:41.680 --> 00:18:45.240
In her inheritance we see that she had dark hair.

124
00:18:45.400 --> 00:18:49.680
She had pretty light skin and dark eyes.

125
00:18:52.800 --> 00:18:55.960
The climate continues to become warmer -

126
00:18:56.120 --> 00:19:01.080
- And in lakes, sea and rapids there are plenty of fish.

127
00:19:02.320 --> 00:19:08.360
Stone age hunters are at least as much collectors and fishermen.

128
00:19:08.520 --> 00:19:13.960
Fishing was an incredibly important part of the economy during this time.

129
00:19:17.520 --> 00:19:20.200
We find fish traps - Mjärdar.

130
00:19:20.360 --> 00:19:25.720
It has an opening where the fish can swim in, but they do not find out.

131
00:19:25.880 --> 00:19:30.760
And then Mjärden is regularly witnessing, emptying it on fish.

132
00:19:30.920 --> 00:19:35.960
The fixed fishing gear means that you can catch large amounts of fish -

133
00:19:36.120 --> 00:19:39.760
- As many people saturate.

134
00:19:58.720 --> 00:20:02.280
The dog was invaluable to the Stone Age hunters.

135
00:20:02.440 --> 00:20:07.960
It served as a guard animal, but was above all important during the hunt.

136
00:20:09.320 --> 00:20:14.480
The dog was more than just a tool, it was part of the group.

137
00:20:18.280 --> 00:20:23.640
We see the dog's special importance, among other things.
 in the dog graves we find.

138
00:20:23.800 --> 00:20:29.320
Here, sometimes the animal has been sprinkled with reddocks, as in human engraves.

139
00:20:31.640 --> 00:20:38.200
Perhaps the dog was seen as more related to man than with the wild animals.

140
00:20:40.400 --> 00:20:44.440
The Stone Age families are nomads and often move.

141
00:20:44.600 --> 00:20:47.640
But traveling with young children is difficult.

142
00:20:47.800 --> 00:20:52.520
To be easy to move, you try to keep the number of children down.

143
00:20:52.680 --> 00:20:56.760
In analyzes of teeth you can see that breastfeeding time has been long-

144
00:20:56.920 --> 00:21:02.120
- And it may have been a way to limit childbirth.

145
00:21:04.040 --> 00:21:09.600
With nature's pantry - fish in the sea and more prey than humans -

146
00:21:09.760 --> 00:21:14.000
- Is life good for the Stone Age hunter.

147
00:21:17.800 --> 00:21:21.560
But there are things that threaten.

148
00:21:35.240 --> 00:21:40.240
Generally, the period is seen as peaceful: plenty of resources, no congestion.

149
00:21:40.400 --> 00:21:45.480
Violence would not be room for.
 But we see unusually much violence:

150
00:21:45.640 --> 00:21:49.160
You have pucked each other, even
 scalped each other.

151
00:21:49.320 --> 00:21:52.360
One must assert one's own land-

152
00:21:52.520 --> 00:21:58.360
- And the permanent fishing spots that groups build and maintain.

153
00:21:58.520 --> 00:22:03.400
They may be at the heart of the group's own territory.

154
00:22:54.120 --> 00:22:59.640
To abandon something, to break up and find new landscapes-

155
00:22:59.800 --> 00:23:05.120
- was nothing strange.
 The Stone Age is characterized by major changes -

156
00:23:05.280 --> 00:23:09.960
–And because you live a mobile life in fairly large areas -

157
00:23:10.120 --> 00:23:14.120
- So this is exactly what you are very good at.

158
00:23:57.680 --> 00:24:01.560
The Österöd woman lives a long life.

159
00:24:05.000 --> 00:24:11.640
Her skeleton shows signs that she had an elite athlete's physique.

160
00:24:19.680 --> 00:24:23.720
In her pelvic bone we saw changes -

161
00:24:23.880 --> 00:24:27.880
- As previously linked to giving birth to many children.

162
00:24:28.040 --> 00:24:33.200
Today, the changes are associated with male football players.

163
00:24:33.360 --> 00:24:39.680
So it has nothing to do with childbirth, but with an active life.

164
00:24:39.840 --> 00:24:45.240
This is what has given rise to the changes we see in the pelvic bone.

165
00:25:02.440 --> 00:25:08.880
Man has not changed so much since the hunter and collector's age.

166
00:25:09.040 --> 00:25:15.600
They probably had equal opportunities to grow old then, as we have today.

167
00:25:15.760 --> 00:25:19.920
They managed from infections and bone fractures and other-

168
00:25:20.080 --> 00:25:23.640
- So you could get really old.

169
00:25:35.680 --> 00:25:39.720
She turns around 70 years old -

170
00:25:39.880 --> 00:25:45.600
- And probably she is buried by loved ones at the coastal band in Bohuslän.

171
00:26:28.960 --> 00:26:33.800
This is where you find her grave - 10,000 years later.

172
00:26:33.960 --> 00:26:39.040
She has been given her current name after the farm Österöd a bit away.

173
00:26:39.200 --> 00:26:45.000
What she died of we do not know, but the remains give a crucial puzzle piece-

174
00:26:45.160 --> 00:26:50.160
- In the knowledge of our history and who we have been.

175
00:27:08.640 --> 00:27:12.760
The life of our ancestors will take a new turn.

176
00:27:12.920 --> 00:27:16.960
For on the other side of the Atlantic, something happens that will be the beginning of a time -

177
00:27:17.120 --> 00:27:21.280
- With dramatic changes in the climate.

178
00:27:24.760 --> 00:27:27.800
First, the temperature suddenly drops.

179
00:27:27.960 --> 00:27:34.240
From a life in a warm, comfortable climate, you now find it difficult to survive.

180
00:27:38.400 --> 00:27:43.080
The last of the Canadian inland ice melts away.

181
00:27:43.240 --> 00:27:49.520
Huge amounts of melt water accumulate in Lake Agassiz - and it falls.

182
00:27:52.720 --> 00:27:57.320
All melt water that then comes out in the North Atlantic in a very short time -

183
00:27:57.480 --> 00:28:00.480
- Emphasize sea circulation in the North Atlantic -

184
00:28:00.640 --> 00:28:05.520
- And it leads to above all colder winters up here.

185
00:28:06.680 --> 00:28:11.680
As the golf current is weakened, the flow of hot water is reduced from the tropics -

186
00:28:11.840 --> 00:28:16.360
- To our part of the world, and the average temperature drops.

187
00:28:24.560 --> 00:28:29.160
This cold and dry period lasts for almost 150 years.

188
00:28:29.320 --> 00:28:31.720
Houses and villages are left fate.

189
00:28:31.880 --> 00:28:37.080
For those who fail to adapt, there is only an end - death.

190
00:28:41.800 --> 00:28:48.280
Of course, when the big changes occur, people react.

191
00:28:48.440 --> 00:28:53.440
It is not impossible that this particular event had such great consequences -

192
00:28:53.600 --> 00:28:57.080
- You started to question the old way of living.

193
00:28:57.240 --> 00:28:59.920
But then the climate turns again.

194
00:29:00.080 --> 00:29:06.200
After a century, the golf current regains its power.
 It gets warmer.

195
00:29:06.360 --> 00:29:10.360
These major climate change back and forth -

196
00:29:10.520 --> 00:29:16.160
- Not only implies people's way of life, but also their faith.

197
00:29:31.800 --> 00:29:35.920
A modern person has a scientific explanation in the climate.

198
00:29:36.080 --> 00:29:40.800
These people must have had other explanations of what happened.

199
00:29:40.960 --> 00:29:45.840
For example, we see an increased closure of victims in large lakes.

200
00:29:46.000 --> 00:29:50.400
Probably it is about wanting to try to restore a balance-

201
00:29:50.560 --> 00:29:54.560
- Between the landscape and man.

202
00:29:54.720 --> 00:29:59.160
We don't know much about what the faith of the Stone Age hunters looked like.

203
00:29:59.320 --> 00:30:03.000
But they have left tracks that can be interpreted.

204
00:30:03.160 --> 00:30:06.760
There were many places that were important to the hunters:

205
00:30:06.920 --> 00:30:11.720
Strange stones and places, where you could sacrifice to sky gods.

206
00:30:11.880 --> 00:30:15.400
But archaeologically, it is very clear -

207
00:30:15.560 --> 00:30:20.560
- That human residues and funerals are often found in connection with water.

208
00:30:20.720 --> 00:30:24.000
It can be interpreted as thinking -

209
00:30:24.160 --> 00:30:27.720
- The road to the realm of death went through the water.

210
00:30:30.760 --> 00:30:37.160
At a overgrown lake north of Motala, the archaeologists make a scary find.

211
00:30:40.560 --> 00:30:47.000
7,700 years ago, here took place an eerie ritual.

212
00:30:50.160 --> 00:30:53.600
So we found the first skull ...

213
00:30:53.760 --> 00:30:58.000
... and shortly thereafter one more skull.

214
00:30:59.040 --> 00:31:02.240
And then it continued like that.

215
00:31:22.480 --> 00:31:27.440
When you look at Motala, we see a picture of skulls -

216
00:31:27.600 --> 00:31:32.480
- Established on piles in water.
 And it may look pretty scary.

217
00:31:32.640 --> 00:31:37.440
But I think it is possible to turn into something positive too.

218
00:32:15.800 --> 00:32:18.840
Because they have no slaughter injuries -

219
00:32:19.000 --> 00:32:23.160
- We interpret it as the bodies decomposed in peace and quiet.

220
00:32:23.320 --> 00:32:28.080
Then other people have put them on piles and taken care of the skulls.

221
00:32:28.240 --> 00:32:33.240
And then you might be able to make comparisons with Catholic relics -

222
00:32:33.400 --> 00:32:37.920
—There remains of holy people revered -

223
00:32:38.080 --> 00:32:43.600
- Because the remains are handled in a nice way and so on.

224
00:32:58.680 --> 00:33:04.840
This is about hunter gathers who often live scattered in the landscape.

225
00:33:07.600 --> 00:33:11.920
They have probably been buried within the framework of a smaller group-

226
00:33:12.080 --> 00:33:17.880
- But since then they wanted to honor the dead with a second funeral ceremony -

227
00:33:18.040 --> 00:33:23.280
- Where a larger group of people have the opportunity to attend.

228
00:33:30.040 --> 00:33:35.000
Motala Ström was not just a place for rituals and funerals.

229
00:33:35.160 --> 00:33:38.920
Many people also seem to have been met for other reasons.

230
00:33:39.080 --> 00:33:44.920
We believe that Motala stream at this time became an important hub -

231
00:33:45.080 --> 00:33:49.280
—While, hunter gathers collected from the surrounding lands-

232
00:33:49.440 --> 00:33:52.920
- One or a couple of times a year.

233
00:34:02.360 --> 00:34:07.120
This was important because people needed to meet from all over the tribe.

234
00:34:07.280 --> 00:34:10.640
Not least the young people who would find a partner.

235
00:34:10.800 --> 00:34:16.000
In order not to get married within the family, a larger selection was given in that way.

236
00:35:00.520 --> 00:35:04.560
It has now been over 2,000 years since the last cold period -

237
00:35:04.720 --> 00:35:09.720
- And since then, the temperature has only continued to increase.

238
00:35:09.880 --> 00:35:13.120
The Scandinavian climate is getting warmer -

239
00:35:13.280 --> 00:35:18.680
- And is more reminiscent of what it is like in France or southern England today.

240
00:35:18.840 --> 00:35:21.880
It can be difficult to imagine -

241
00:35:22.040 --> 00:35:26.880
- But then there were turtles and pelicans in the Swedish lakes.

242
00:35:41.280 --> 00:35:44.760
We are at Nämforsen in the Ångerman River.

243
00:35:44.920 --> 00:35:49.240
This was a sea bay then and nature looked different.

244
00:35:49.400 --> 00:35:52.600
It was hot and there was plenty of food.

245
00:35:52.760 --> 00:35:57.760
Probably life was quite comfortable for the Stone Age hunters here.

246
00:35:57.920 --> 00:36:03.920
They left traces behind them.
 The oldest ones are 6,000 years old.

247
00:36:15.640 --> 00:36:19.760
The rock carving area is one of the largest in Europe.

248
00:36:19.920 --> 00:36:24.720
And the pictures tell us about people's lives and world of thought.

249
00:36:34.520 --> 00:36:41.000
About 400 boats are carved - everything from large ships to small boats.

250
00:36:41.160 --> 00:36:48.400
There are 700 animals depicted, of which 460 are roughly safe moose.

251
00:36:56.280 --> 00:37:01.960
The moose must have been of great importance, because it is to such a large extent.

252
00:37:03.520 --> 00:37:07.080
The reason for carving in precisely moose -

253
00:37:07.240 --> 00:37:12.640
- It is that you use the moose in every conceivable context.

254
00:37:12.800 --> 00:37:18.320
She gives clothes, she gives meat, and she is part of nature's fertility.

255
00:37:33.840 --> 00:37:38.880
There was plenty of game and fish here far inside the bay.

256
00:37:39.040 --> 00:37:44.560
In a protected location, it was a perfect place for the Stone Age man.

257
00:37:44.720 --> 00:37:50.760
And when the salmon played in the bay, it became a gathering place for many more.

258
00:37:50.920 --> 00:37:57.480
The carvings are the tracks you left behind for future generations.

259
00:38:07.760 --> 00:38:13.640
For 8,000 years, Scandinavia has lived as hunters and collectors -

260
00:38:13.800 --> 00:38:19.080
- And adapted life to the availability of food and the animals' movements.

261
00:38:19.240 --> 00:38:22.600
A life in constant movement.

262
00:38:27.360 --> 00:38:31.680
But all that will change soon ...

263
00:38:37.600 --> 00:38:43.400
The mild, humid climate attracts a new group of people to move here.

264
00:38:45.560 --> 00:38:51.240
First comes individual men who explore the new lands.

265
00:38:56.200 --> 00:38:59.400
And then whole families.

266
00:39:03.040 --> 00:39:08.960
With them they have a precious load and a special knowledge -

267
00:39:09.120 --> 00:39:13.960
- This will lead to one of the biggest changes in our history.

268
00:39:14.120 --> 00:39:18.400
It is now that we are starting to grow our food.

269
00:39:24.120 --> 00:39:29.240
Agriculture comes from the Middle East.
 Here they had grown and refined grain -

270
00:39:29.400 --> 00:39:35.120
- Maybe 10,000 years, and livestock had been kept for almost as long.

271
00:39:35.280 --> 00:39:40.840
Knowledge is surprisingly slowly spreading from Central Europe into the Nordic countries.

272
00:39:41.000 --> 00:39:45.880
Maybe it finally came here because there was unbroken ground here -

273
00:39:46.040 --> 00:39:48.840
- In combination with human curiosity.

274
00:39:49.000 --> 00:39:53.920
This is the beginning of modern life that we live today.

275
00:40:03.360 --> 00:40:07.480
When the Stone Age farmers begin to settle in the areas of the hunters -

276
00:40:07.640 --> 00:40:11.520
- arises a risk of conflicts.

277
00:40:11.680 --> 00:40:17.240
But negotiations and gifts can solve difficult situations.

278
00:40:22.200 --> 00:40:27.920
There may have been conflicts, but we will find no traces after that.

279
00:40:28.080 --> 00:40:34.760
It may have been peaceful - you have solved situations with negotiation.

280
00:40:35.880 --> 00:40:40.720
It is likely that the movements have been planned fairly carefully -

281
00:40:40.880 --> 00:40:45.880
–Annatted the landscape and negotiated with the hunter collectors in the area-

282
00:40:46.040 --> 00:40:51.040
- If you could settle and under what conditions, etc.

283
00:40:59.240 --> 00:41:03.240
A big difference between being a hunter and being a farmer is -

284
00:41:03.400 --> 00:41:07.840
- That the farmer can produce surplus.
 It doesn't mean just-

285
00:41:08.000 --> 00:41:13.840
- You can save for worse times, you can also help people around.

286
00:41:14.000 --> 00:41:18.720
In fact, the peasant life requires an increasing cooperation -

287
00:41:18.880 --> 00:41:22.080
—Man between different groups -

288
00:41:22.240 --> 00:41:28.200
- And that's why we get a society that may be more similar to what we have today.

289
00:41:28.360 --> 00:41:32.920
This went pretty fast.
 In individual generations -

290
00:41:33.080 --> 00:41:38.160
- The population in southern Sweden, mainly through immigration.

291
00:41:45.080 --> 00:41:49.400
The first cereals you grow are wheat and single grains -

292
00:41:49.560 --> 00:41:54.080
- And this is the cereal that we still use.

293
00:41:54.240 --> 00:41:58.880
With the Stone Age farmers, not only comes the knowledge of cultivation.

294
00:41:59.040 --> 00:42:03.400
There will also be a new kind of beautifully decorated ceramic.

295
00:42:03.560 --> 00:42:08.840
Archaeologists call the new farmer culture for funnel tramp culture-

296
00:42:09.000 --> 00:42:13.600
—Af after one of the typical vascular forms of ceramics available from the period -

297
00:42:13.760 --> 00:42:16.680
- With the form of just a funnel beaker.

298
00:42:16.840 --> 00:42:23.280
Characteristic, besides the funnel form, is that you often decorated the necks.

299
00:42:23.440 --> 00:42:27.440
One has been able to have them buried in the ground, swallow-

300
00:42:27.600 --> 00:42:32.360
- And have both food and fresh water in these vessels.

301
00:42:32.520 --> 00:42:36.440
You could say that it is a form of refrigerator.

302
00:42:36.600 --> 00:42:42.600
With agriculture you become more resident and live in the same place all year round.

303
00:42:42.760 --> 00:42:47.680
One advantage of being a farmer is that you can house a larger family.

304
00:42:47.840 --> 00:42:53.800
You need many who can work in the yard and you need many children.

305
00:42:53.960 --> 00:42:59.880
During this period, we also see that child mortality is declining.

306
00:43:24.960 --> 00:43:29.240
There are both farmers and hunter collectors groups at the same time.

307
00:43:29.400 --> 00:43:35.280
We see in the archaeological material that they have exchanged objects.

308
00:43:44.760 --> 00:43:49.760
But we also look at DNA in the skeleton, that they did not have children with each other.

309
00:43:49.920 --> 00:43:54.160
They have lived separately for 1,000 years - that's 40 generations -

310
00:43:54.320 --> 00:44:00.040
- So there must have been strong barriers to mix.

311
00:44:21.440 --> 00:44:28.640
But with the new way of life a new threat emerges: diseases.

312
00:44:48.440 --> 00:44:51.240
One lives not only near the animals -

313
00:44:51.400 --> 00:44:55.440
- You also live close to the stools and their own stools.

314
00:44:55.600 --> 00:45:01.840
This means that we come into contact with brand new microorganisms -

315
00:45:02.000 --> 00:45:06.400
- Oloba parasites and other things that lead to intestinal infections.

316
00:45:06.560 --> 00:45:12.960
And when many live closely together, respiratory infections also increase.

317
00:45:13.120 --> 00:45:17.600
Tuberculosis and flu and the like.

318
00:45:42.640 --> 00:45:48.440
With the new agricultural culture, new ways will also bury the dead.

319
00:45:48.600 --> 00:45:54.240
Some get their last rest in graves built of colossal boulders.

320
00:46:06.080 --> 00:46:10.360
With the more resident lifestyle that the farmers bring with them -

321
00:46:10.520 --> 00:46:14.920
- The way of thinking is changed.
 The tombs are not only ritually important -

322
00:46:15.080 --> 00:46:20.280
-What they also become a way to show the greatness and success of the family.

323
00:46:20.440 --> 00:46:25.560
You start to distinguish between those who have power, and those who lack it.

324
00:46:32.640 --> 00:46:35.800
The big stone tombs have corridors -

325
00:46:35.960 --> 00:46:41.920
- And they are targeting the sun's rise in late autumn.

326
00:46:42.080 --> 00:46:48.480
In the ancient Nordic calendar, it was the time when the spirits of the dead arrived -

327
00:46:48.640 --> 00:46:53.520
-And there is something that lives in Halloween and in Halloween -day -

328
00:46:53.680 --> 00:46:57.760
- When we visit cemeteries and so on.

329
00:47:00.520 --> 00:47:06.680
In the opening, gifts were added that the dead brought with them in life after this.

330
00:47:11.000 --> 00:47:13.600
It could be ceramics ...

331
00:47:15.880 --> 00:47:17.920
... amber beads ...

332
00:47:18.080 --> 00:47:22.160
... and of course pieces of the valuable flint.

333
00:47:22.320 --> 00:47:25.280
The flint was the lubricant of society.

334
00:47:25.440 --> 00:47:31.280
They opened flint mines in Skåne and Denmark, and then traveled expeditions -

335
00:47:31.440 --> 00:47:36.000
- Maybe every year and changed flint axes, and then they went home.

336
00:47:36.160 --> 00:47:40.240
This was done throughout southern Sweden, right up to Mälardalen.

337
00:47:40.400 --> 00:47:43.920
There they sacrificed a lot of Flintan -

338
00:47:44.080 --> 00:47:48.200
- To the gods, mainly mother earth, to get good harvests.

339
00:47:48.360 --> 00:47:51.760
You did not need the flint axes.

340
00:47:51.920 --> 00:47:57.440
The usual axes in the local stone species were at least as effective.

341
00:48:10.200 --> 00:48:13.200
The time is almost six meters long.

342
00:48:21.600 --> 00:48:27.520
Here in front is the chamber where the dead were laid for their last rest.

343
00:48:37.360 --> 00:48:44.000
The roof consists of four large roofing hills, between one and two meters wide.

344
00:48:45.920 --> 00:48:49.920
The stones in the hallway are a little lower than in the chamber.

345
00:48:50.080 --> 00:48:55.080
In order to handle the level difference, a keystone of granite - has been placed

346
00:48:55.240 --> 00:49:00.760
- An extra strong rock that could carry the weight from the roof block.

347
00:49:03.000 --> 00:49:07.600
An incredibly complicated and skillfully done work.

348
00:49:07.760 --> 00:49:13.120
The stone chamber tombs were engineering or architecture at a very high level -

349
00:49:13.280 --> 00:49:16.800
- And for this job, builders were required.

350
00:49:16.960 --> 00:49:21.240
There is a way to build graves on the east side Sweden -

351
00:49:21.400 --> 00:49:26.680
- And one on the west side.
 Two different architectural traditions are believed.

352
00:49:31.000 --> 00:49:35.640
This particular grave is built about 5,300 years ago.

353
00:49:35.800 --> 00:49:40.320
It belonged to a Stone Age family for many generations.

354
00:49:40.480 --> 00:49:46.120
Such a grave is also a way to showcase its wealth and power.

355
00:49:46.280 --> 00:49:51.440
Society becomes more unequal.
 Not material really, but ritually.

356
00:49:51.600 --> 00:49:55.640
Some people and families gained great ritual power.

357
00:49:55.800 --> 00:50:00.600
Empty.
 power over life and death.
 The first human victims appear now -

358
00:50:00.760 --> 00:50:05.080
- What is an extreme way to mark its influence.

359
00:50:10.800 --> 00:50:16.240
Here is a young woman.
 She was 18-20 years old when she died.

360
00:50:16.400 --> 00:50:23.040
Of the findings, we can see that she has not died a natural death.

361
00:50:24.800 --> 00:50:31.440
The young woman is killed in a lake 5,000 years ago, outside Falköping.

362
00:50:31.600 --> 00:50:37.680
The stomach content has been preserved.
 She had eaten lots of raspberries before she died.

363
00:50:37.840 --> 00:50:42.040
That's how she got her name - the raspberry girl.

364
00:50:42.200 --> 00:50:47.040
She is Sweden's first known human sacrifice.

365
00:50:47.200 --> 00:50:52.960
The way she was in the water shows that she did not drown in the usual way.

366
00:50:53.120 --> 00:50:56.120
Her hands were tied on her stomach.

367
00:50:56.280 --> 00:51:02.640
Her legs and feet were connected to the back of the thigh, towards the buttocks.

368
00:51:02.800 --> 00:51:07.840
This clearly shows that she has not only fallen into the water and drowned -

369
00:51:08.000 --> 00:51:12.560
- The way she has been brought about life.
 Someone has helped.

370
00:51:19.120 --> 00:51:24.280
You do this to achieve a result, maybe better harvests.

371
00:51:24.440 --> 00:51:29.240
It can be peace with the gods.
 It can be peace with the ancestors.

372
00:51:29.400 --> 00:51:35.400
There may be social reasons.
 You take a person's life - with spectator masses.

373
00:51:35.560 --> 00:51:38.280
And it's about highlighting:

374
00:51:38.440 --> 00:51:43.440
"It is me who decides who is allowed to live and who is allowed to die."

375
00:51:45.600 --> 00:51:48.400
At the time when the raspberry girl is killed -

376
00:51:48.560 --> 00:51:54.360
- If a new group of people have begun to move through Europe, towards Sweden.

377
00:51:54.520 --> 00:52:00.360
And they have something with them that makes the Stone Age start to come to an end.

378
00:52:03.400 --> 00:52:06.360
This is a new group of people.

379
00:52:06.520 --> 00:52:11.360
They have their origin in what is today Russia and Ukraine.

380
00:52:11.520 --> 00:52:17.880
They move quickly across the continent and up to Scandinavia -

381
00:52:18.040 --> 00:52:21.520
- Among other things by riding horses.

382
00:52:33.600 --> 00:52:37.600
Some people in this group ended their days here.

383
00:52:37.760 --> 00:52:42.360
When this roundabout in Linköping was built, a stone -age grave was found.

384
00:52:42.520 --> 00:52:47.760
Before the construction could be completed, the archaeologists had to dig out the place.

385
00:52:47.920 --> 00:52:53.080
What was found was unique.
 The gifts that the dead have brought with them in the grave -

386
00:52:53.240 --> 00:52:57.600
- shows that a new era in our history is on the way.

387
00:53:06.960 --> 00:53:09.760
It is a funeral of a young couple.

388
00:53:09.920 --> 00:53:15.080
We don't know what killed them, but we know they died early.

389
00:53:15.240 --> 00:53:19.600
They are buried together 4,500 years ago -

390
00:53:19.760 --> 00:53:24.400
-Added by gifts for the last trip.

391
00:53:24.560 --> 00:53:31.400
Gifts that tell them that they belong to a new culture: the combat culture.

392
00:53:31.560 --> 00:53:36.840
And it will be dominant throughout southern Scandinavia.

393
00:53:37.800 --> 00:53:44.720
Battle ax culture is called it, after the battle ax - which was unlucky.

394
00:53:44.880 --> 00:53:49.480
Above all, it was a symbolic object that one showed -

395
00:53:49.640 --> 00:53:54.440
- To show that you were an important member of society.

396
00:54:01.120 --> 00:54:05.840
Looking at past migration waves or change processes-

397
00:54:06.000 --> 00:54:11.600
- Hos the Stone Age hunters or farms, so it happens for a long time.

398
00:54:11.760 --> 00:54:15.360
But here it only takes a few hundred years.

399
00:54:16.720 --> 00:54:21.240
The man and woman are not alone in their grave.

400
00:54:21.400 --> 00:54:27.400
At the same time with the couple, a three -month -old infant is also buried.

401
00:54:41.400 --> 00:54:46.480
In the grave is also a dog and objects that tell about the family.

402
00:55:02.680 --> 00:55:06.000
There are no visible injuries -

403
00:55:06.160 --> 00:55:09.640
- So they may have drowned or died of illness.

404
00:55:09.800 --> 00:55:12.600
It is a well -ordered pair-

405
00:55:12.760 --> 00:55:16.640
- Probably with a lot of power and a leading function in the countryside.

406
00:55:16.800 --> 00:55:24.000
The woman is exciting, because she has had a magic bag full of gear -

407
00:55:24.160 --> 00:55:29.920
- As a knife, a lace, bearer, a amber pearl and much more.

408
00:55:30.080 --> 00:55:34.160
This shows that she probably has been medicine woman -

409
00:55:34.320 --> 00:55:37.640
- But also a leader of rituals.

410
00:55:37.800 --> 00:55:41.800
In front of her nose she has a victim of deer horns -

411
00:55:41.960 --> 00:55:46.400
- As we lead the rituals in addition.

412
00:55:54.400 --> 00:56:01.280
Then the first people came here to hunt in the summers a lot has happened.

413
00:56:02.400 --> 00:56:06.800
At the end of the Stone Age, the various groups that have populated our country-

414
00:56:06.960 --> 00:56:09.960
- Gained joint children.

415
00:56:10.120 --> 00:56:13.280
The Northern Age of Stone Age learned from each other -

416
00:56:13.440 --> 00:56:16.440
- Explores to new generations.

417
00:56:17.360 --> 00:56:21.520
The people here have become the sum of their history.

418
00:56:23.280 --> 00:56:27.000
The vast majority will live their lives as farmers -

419
00:56:27.160 --> 00:56:32.440
- But in the north people keep lives in the hunt and the collection.

420
00:57:01.680 --> 00:57:06.960
In the mountain grave there are also signs that the Stone Age is soon over.

421
00:57:07.120 --> 00:57:12.320
For next to the dead are small spirals - in copper.

422
00:57:12.480 --> 00:57:16.480
And they warn that a new time is on the way.

423
00:57:20.200 --> 00:57:23.000
A new chapter in our history -

424
00:57:23.160 --> 00:57:28.800
- Then golden bronze and shiny iron break through up here in the Nordic countries.

425
00:57:28.960 --> 00:57:35.200
The pursuit of metals causes people to embark on dangerous travel -

426
00:57:35.360 --> 00:57:38.480
- And leave the Stone Age behind.

427
00:57:38.640 --> 00:57:41.840
It is the time of the metals.

428
00:57:45.680 --> 00:57:50.240
