- Hopping in beds or going handrail ... - Now I'm on my way.

11
00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:55.120
Gustav, are you sure you should not come along?

12
00:01:55.280 --> 00:02:01.120
C. Head Tapersån must look after C. Head talk it works here at home.

C. Head talk - because I like them!

C. The head talk I do!
 This morning, C. Head Tapers I tried that new toothpaste you bought.

16
00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:29.440
C. HUMANTPRATAREDEN WAS NOT GOOD!

17
00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:33.240
It was foot ointment.

18
00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:41.760
Don't worry about the kids.
 I have arranged a babysitter.

19
00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:49.360
- Mom, we're actually big now!
 C. Head talk - Yes!

21
00:02:56.920 --> 00:03:04.040
C. Head Taper - Stole the door.

- Is it you who is our babysitter?
 - Lena told me you were alone.

23
00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:20.200
Pontus would also go away, so it was a perfect opportunity to meet you!

24
00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:25.800
C. Head Tapraredu Did not check C. Head talk we had other plans?

25
00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:31.560
Be a little kind.
 It's been four months since last.

C. Head talk no. I know.

42
00:05:04.720 --> 00:05:08.200
Pontus and I eat it evenly.

43
00:05:08.360 --> 00:05:14.000
You can eat with your fingers.
 Start, Gustav.

44
00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:17.920
C. Head talk - no thanks.
 - Gustav ...

45
00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:23.520
You can play with the boys some other time.

46
00:05:23.680 --> 00:05:29.040
How are things in Stockholm?
 What do you usually do?

47
00:05:29.200 --> 00:05:35.880
On weekends we go out and eat, go in some fun place ...

 I'm glad I moved there.

50
00:05:51.080 --> 00:05:54.960
What about Pontus, do you enjoy together?

51
00:05:55.120 --> 00:05:58.440
I have something important to tell ...

52
00:05:58.600 --> 00:06:05.560
-Oh no!
 He has left you!
 - You have left him and want to live here?

53
00:06:05.720 --> 00:06:12.960

54
00:06:13.120 --> 00:06:17.560
- I want a family.

55
00:06:19.080 --> 00:06:24.520
C. Head Tapers - Getting Family is the meaning of life!
 -Thanks!

56
00:06:24.680 --> 00:06:32.320
That's why I wanted to be with you and feel the advantages and disadvantages.

57
00:06:32.480 --> 00:06:36.120
The disadvantage is there.

58
00:06:36.280 --> 00:06:42.120
-I understand.
 We are guinea pigs.
 - Don't see it so.

59
00:06:42.280 --> 00:06:48.440
It's like buying a car.
 You want to test drive first.

60
00:06:48.600 --> 00:06:56.040
C. Head Taper Welcome!
 You are aware of the C. Head Testing Testing Family Rolls Royce!

You have to get your gifts!

63
00:07:08.280 --> 00:07:12.720
Exciting things that are not here ...

64
00:07:12.880 --> 00:07:17.320
Yes, some in school grow themselves.

65
00:07:17.480 --> 00:07:22.400

 You are welcome.
 -Thanks.

66
00:07:22.560 --> 00:07:29.200

67
00:07:31.800 --> 00:07:37.960
-What is this?
 - The city house in winter garb.
 Turn it.

68
00:07:38.120 --> 00:07:43.040
Look!
 It's snowing!
 What invention, huh?

69
00:07:45.360 --> 00:07:51.200
C. HOVA PATERUA is taken how far ahead of C. Huvudpratarede is located in Stockholm.

70
00:07:51.360 --> 00:07:58.240
- This is to you, Lina.
 - A t - shirt with the Globe on, maybe?

71
00:07:58.400 --> 00:08:02.280
It actually is a little more fun.

72
00:08:02.440 --> 00:08:08.280
- The nest tower ... - did you prefer to have the Globe?

73
00:08:08.440 --> 00:08:14.440
No.
 I become the most popular girl of the school ...

74
00:08:14.600 --> 00:08:19.920
- To you ... C. Head talkative - I don't get away.

75
00:08:21.920 --> 00:08:25.560
C. Head talk, yes ... underwear.

76
00:08:25.720 --> 00:08:29.360
Björn Borg - Calunders.

77
00:08:34.640 --> 00:08:39.760
C. Head talk "To my friend Gustav C. Head Tapers from ... Björn Borg."

78
00:08:47.280 --> 00:08:50.720
What do you say now?

79
00:08:50.880 --> 00:08:55.320
C. The head talk is the finest gift I received!

80
00:08:55.480 --> 00:09:02.800
- He stood and signed at NK ... - you may only have them when you turn years.

81
00:09:02.960 --> 00:09:09.600
C. Head talk, listen carefully.
 These should never be C. Head talk by any human being.

82
00:09:09.760 --> 00:09:15.400
C. Head talk - they stand over this.
 They are "Karim".
 -What did you say?

83
00:09:15.560 --> 00:09:21.240
C. Head talk is Hebrew: C. Head Certificate Hög, forever.

84
00:09:21.400 --> 00:09:27.240
The C. Head talk is just the Virgin Mary C. Head talk and these that are.

85
00:09:36.360 --> 00:09:44.240
C. Head talk - do you mark any difference in here?
 -Yes.
 Your wedding photo is gone.

86
00:09:44.400 --> 00:09:50.880
C. Head talk - do you get angry?
 - No, there are underwear there.

87
00:09:51.040 --> 00:09:57.360
-It is one o'clock.
 What should we do?
 - I am going to Camilla.

88
00:09:57.520 --> 00:10:04.960
I am here for such a short time.
 Can't we do anything together, like a real family?

89
00:10:05.120 --> 00:10:10.480
Tell!
 What do you do in a real family?

90
00:10:10.640 --> 00:10:17.160
You make excursions, you play games, big shops ...

91
00:10:17.320 --> 00:10:24.960
- We go to the new shopping center!
 - Yes, there we have never been!

95
00:10:45.120 --> 00:10:52.560
-What then?
 Do they not have middle milk?
 - They said they had heard of it.

96
00:10:52.720 --> 00:10:57.360
They have four floors.
 Over 50 stores!

97
00:10:57.520 --> 00:11:04.840
C. Head talk - and may they all burn in hell.
 --Inomhus fountain and water slide!

98
00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:09.440
C. HOVA PATERADE can have dancing penguins too!

99
00:11:09.600 --> 00:11:15.240
They have that!
 At one o'clock outside McDonald's.

100
00:11:15.400 --> 00:11:21.080
C. Head talkative self does not dance C. Head talk after the pipe of commercialism!

101
00:11:21.240 --> 00:11:27.240
But look ... it is three o'clock it is the Banarne show.

102
00:11:27.400 --> 00:11:34.480
- He will introduce some new coffee.
 C. Head Tapers -Banarne?
 The real one, from TV?

103
00:11:34.640 --> 00:11:36.920
Yes.

104
00:11:38.080 --> 00:11:46.160
C. HOVEPRATARARE HAVE EVERYTHING!
 I was actually C. HOVEPRATAREELLIT when you showed up this morning.

00:12:01.120 --> 00:12:08.120
–Fast I pulled you away from the show?
 C. Head talk - I had seen it three times.

107
00:12:08.280 --> 00:12:13.920
C. Head Tapers Indeed Mellansnack, Good songs ... C. Head Precatee was moved with!

108
00:12:14.080 --> 00:12:19.680
The banaries looked surprised when you hugged him.

109
00:12:19.840 --> 00:12:25.200
C. Head talkative self was moved.
 He probably became the C. Head talk.

110
00:12:25.360 --> 00:12:29.800
C. Head talk, how nice he wrote to me.

111
00:12:35.880 --> 00:12:43.240
Then was it good that you came along?
 "Copenhagen" wasn't so stupid, huh?

112
00:12:43.400 --> 00:12:50.760
C. Head Tapers "Free City" should be hot!
 C. Head talker!
 You had to take as many people you wanted.

113
00:12:51.920 --> 00:12:54.960

122
00:13:55.520 --> 00:14:03.160
- They should start playing the second round.
 C. Head talk - I don't have time with his poker!

123
00:14:03.320 --> 00:14:09.760
You heard, huh?
 I know.
 He is cheating in monopoly as well.
 Bye.

124
00:14:12.600 --> 00:14:19.160
Well ... what do you say?
 Could there be any mom of me?

125
00:14:19.320 --> 00:14:22.320
Absolutely!

126
00:14:22.480 --> 00:14:28.120
C. Head talk - Din Family becomes a happy family!
 -Do you mean it?

127
00:14:28.280 --> 00:14:32.160
C. Head Tapraredu is safe, has fantasy ...

128
00:14:32.320 --> 00:14:36.160
C. Head talk ... and stands on Hamngatan!

129
00:14:36.320 --> 00:14:41.560
Where did your talk about solidarity go?

130
00:14:41.720 --> 00:14:48.200
C. Head Tapers I have a million soon.
 C. Head Tapers There is no solidarity.

131
00:14:48.360 --> 00:14:54.840
The family plays games and little pans and has a cozy ...

132
00:14:55.000 --> 00:15:01.480
C. Head talk, we should play monopoly more often.
 C. Head talkative here determines the intelligence.

133
00:15:01.640 --> 00:15:05.280
Exactly.
 Stupidest wins.

134
00:15:06.120 --> 00:15:09.960
I have to ask one thing ...

135
00:15:11.120 --> 00:15:18.280
You have been together as a family for almost fifteen years.
 How do you cope?

136
00:15:18.440 --> 00:15:22.880
What makes it work?

137
00:15:23.040 --> 00:15:29.400
- We eat at different times.
 C. Head Tapers - Sara is on something essential.

138
00:15:29.560 --> 00:15:36.200
C. Head Tapers What do you think is the reason for C. Head talk we enjoy so well together?

139
00:15:42.960 --> 00:15:50.600
I can say what I think.
 It is enough that you let each other be different.

140
00:15:50.760 --> 00:15:55.600
The Svensson family's three words of honor are:

141
00:15:55.760 --> 00:16:01.440
Respect, community and enormous warmth.

142
00:16:02.880 --> 00:16:07.360
You have mixed us up with others ...

143
00:16:08.400 --> 00:16:12.240
I think the most important thing is -

144
00:16:12.400 --> 00:16:17.640
- That we care about each other, listen ...

145
00:16:17.800 --> 00:16:21.400
C. Head Taparest, Lina ...

146
00:16:21.560 --> 00:16:29.200
C. Head Tapers The family can be tested their thoughts C. Head talk and ideas without being convicted.

147
00:16:29.360 --> 00:16:34.760
Like when you rebuilt the lawnmower into a kitchen fan?

148
00:16:34.920 --> 00:16:42.880
C. Head Tapa you set up!
 Didn't say a word C. Head Tapers Mom wondered over grass in the ceiling.

149
00:16:43.040 --> 00:16:50.400
C. Head talk - because you safeguarded the family!
 - And because you gave us half the salary.

150
00:16:50.560 --> 00:16:54.000
What is most important?

151
00:16:54.160 --> 00:17:00.520
Whatever I do, I know that mom and dad love me!

152
00:17:00.680 --> 00:17:06.800
- What has tuned it?
 -No.
 But that's what she wants to hear.

153
00:17:07.760 --> 00:17:14.600
But God ... it is almost eight o'clock.
 Replace.
 The disco will start soon.

154
00:17:14.760 --> 00:17:21.200
C. Head Tapers - Disk?
