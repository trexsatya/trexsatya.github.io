1
00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:12.840
Check!
 Look what a nice one.
 This one is getting perfect, Billy.

2
00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:17.920
Do we have to keep up with fox scissors?
 Is it even legal?

3
00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:23.440
Legal and legal.
 It is not legal to pee down the village either.

4
00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:28.880
It does not prevent you from throwing out the Kiss screw and syringe.

5
00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:33.440
The point of hunting is to kill the animals and take advantage of everything.

6
00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:39.480
You can cook a pot.
 Then you can stop the animal and make money.

7
00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:45.640
It's nice meat, this.
 Find out that now, and we're looking down there.

8
00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:14.360
Eat up that.

9
00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:35.320
-No, Fy Satan.
 It's not possible, Leif.
 -Ad off to sparkle and eat up!

10
00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:40.840
It's not possible!
 It is physically impossible.
 I can't eat fox.

11
00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:45.400
It tastes fishing.
 We must find something else.

12
00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:52.080
My God, Billy Öhman.
 I lie for fucking sleepless, wake up in the quart-

13
00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:58.480
-With cold sweat in the anal and has pissed me down.
 I have anxiety.

14
00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:04.640
I can barely play without thinking: "How the hell should I get the economy together?"

15
00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:10.000
And then you sit ungrateful and fucking and whine at the dining table.
 Fuck!

16
00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:15.480
We must be able to find something else.
 Surely we can pall potatoes again?

17
00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:18.520
Potato?
 Oh, how smart!

18
00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:23.880
Then I can get scurvy again, is that what you want?

19
00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:27.560
No, Leif.
 I don't want to.

20
00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:37.240
-Now I know.
 Do you know what to do?
 -No what?

21
00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:40.520
You should manage yourself.

22
00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:45.840
God, what fun!
 You should feel what it is like to stand on your own.

23
00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:51.440
-Sorry.
 Take it easy ... -No, I don't want to hear anymore.

24
00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:55.440
You can fix your own fucking food.

25
00:02:55.600 --> 00:03:03.840
And don't ask me for one thing.
 Curious it in your stomach you can eat a grass.

26
00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:09.000
I'll go and make money.
 You can go up to your computer and put yourself-

27
00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:14.520
-And hopes that it flies in some fucking blackbish in your mouth.

28
00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:25.080
Hello!
 Act!

29
00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:29.720
Get off!
 Fans hell.

30
00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:36.400
-Do hell what people you have today.
 -It's that white moose.

31
00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:42.240
The Germans are crazy in it.
 What can I help you with?
 What the hell is this?

32
00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:47.400
Have you seen?
 Young female fox, purple.
 I murdered her this morning.

33
00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:52.560
I can fix as many as possible.
 800 bucks, bargain and clear.

34
00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:57.920
-What are you saying?
 -Are you in financial pick now again?

35
00:03:58.080 --> 00:04:01.880
No, but ... what is economic bundle?

36
00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:08.200
I want to help.
 The village has given me so much.
 I want to give back.

37
00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:13.360
-It's a good craft.
 -I don't say anything about the craft.

38
00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:19.320
When I bought the Mården from you, two went to the staff at Sabbb.
 Take it out.

39
00:04:19.480 --> 00:04:23.120
But come on.
 Okay, 300 bucks.

40
00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:28.120
-Just take it out.
 Please I beg of you.
 -Yeah.
 Okay.

41
00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:34.720
Nice work, Anders.
 Good business.
 Good business.
 Beautiful Work.

42
00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:40.840
You don't know how to do it.
 Then you want me to go to a competitor?

43
00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:44.720
That's the last thing you see of that fox.

44
00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:51.280
Oh, the staff got scabies ...

45
00:04:55.320 --> 00:04:58.120
50,000?

46
00:04:59.680 --> 00:05:04.240
Leif!
 The eye.
 It should be able to see something.

47
00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:10.000
You, Anders.
 The competition, is it you to sign up for, right?

48
00:05:10.160 --> 00:05:13.160
Yes, but you have no license?

49
00:05:13.320 --> 00:05:17.360
No, but can't you be included anyway?

50
00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:22.000
Do you have hunting teams, someone with a license and dog, so absolutely.

51
00:05:22.160 --> 00:05:27.480
But you have none of it?
 Next year maybe if you are back then.

52
00:05:27.640 --> 00:05:32.360
-Duck with the fox now, you!
 -Yes.
 Thank you then.

53
00:05:32.520 --> 00:05:35.400
For nothing.

54
00:05:46.200 --> 00:05:49.440
-Tjena, Tony.
 -Is it good?

55
00:05:49.600 --> 00:05:54.400
-Good.
 Self?
 -Good.
 The brother you met.

56
00:05:54.560 --> 00:05:59.560
-He is the new hunting leader for this year.
 -Oh, fuck.
 There you see.

57
00:05:59.720 --> 00:06:06.760
That's how it is.
 Should you and your brother participate in the trophy competition this year, right?

58
00:06:06.920 --> 00:06:10.360
Well, no ... it probably won't.

59
00:06:10.520 --> 00:06:16.920
The police seized his brother's rifle when he ... last year when he ...

60
00:06:17.080 --> 00:06:20.080
-The bullshit my dog?
 -Exactly.

61
00:06:20.240 --> 00:06:23.960
I heard that.
 But you then, Billy?

62
00:06:25.680 --> 00:06:29.840
-I?
 -You have both a license and a gun?

63
00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:34.520
Urbom and Micke have jumped off the hunting team now, so ...

64
00:06:34.680 --> 00:06:41.560
We need a good shooter, like you.
 It's 50,000 in the pot, Billy.

65
00:06:41.720 --> 00:06:46.000
-Yes ... -come again now.
 Come on!

66
00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:51.120
-What does little paw say?
 -What does the paw say?

67
00:06:51.280 --> 00:06:56.280
-U fun!
 Welcome to the team.
 -Fan what a wonderful.
 Fun that you asked.

68
00:06:56.440 --> 00:07:01.640
Welcome to the Stockholm team.
 Greeting the brother.

69
00:07:01.800 --> 00:07:05.080
-That he's an idiot.
 -Yes.

70
00:07:44.200 --> 00:07:48.280
-How did the fox go?
 -Good.

71
00:07:48.440 --> 00:07:53.600
-Why do you have it, then?
 -I don't have it left?

72
00:07:54.720 --> 00:07:57.840
It is there.

73
00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:02.680
Yes.
 I kept it.
 Is it so damn weird?

74
00:08:02.840 --> 00:08:09.240
There were so many who bid, so I felt "you know what, I keep it".

75
00:08:09.400 --> 00:08:13.680
-It's so damn nice.
 -Okay.

76
00:08:16.960 --> 00:08:20.640
Why have you produced it?

77
00:08:20.800 --> 00:08:28.120
Eh ... yes, Mackan and Tony were here recently, and ...

78
00:08:28.280 --> 00:08:33.040
And ... yes, they ... they ...

79
00:08:33.200 --> 00:08:37.760
What, Billy?
 Did they want to start a sauna club?

80
00:08:37.920 --> 00:08:44.160
No.
 They asked if I wanted to be part of their team for the trophy competition.

81
00:08:44.320 --> 00:08:47.320
I accepted yes.

82
00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:55.640
It's 50,000 in the pot, and I need money now.

83
00:08:56.640 --> 00:08:59.040
And?

84
00:08:59.200 --> 00:09:03.520
I thought you might want to know ...

85
00:09:03.680 --> 00:09:09.600
Does it look like I care?
 Like this face wants to know?
 No!

86
00:09:18.800 --> 00:09:21.680
c. soundtuppen gal

87
00:09:36.040 --> 00:09:39.040
C. soundbreaks from outside

88
00:09:45.440 --> 00:09:48.280
-Slept well?
 -In, absolutely.

89
00:09:48.440 --> 00:09:51.120
What about the trigger finger?

90
00:09:51.280 --> 00:09:54.360
Damn ...

91
00:09:54.520 --> 00:09:57.520
Then we see you over there.

92
00:10:04.720 --> 00:10:10.880
-Hunting teams do you say, Leif?
 -Yes, you and me and so the dog.

93
00:10:11.040 --> 00:10:16.040
-Imagine what a fucking dream team.
 -No, don't say it.

94
00:10:16.200 --> 00:10:20.920
-I'm a little too old.
 -No not are you old?

95
00:10:21.080 --> 00:10:26.800
You just have to sit on a pass, so I and the Bamse Älgarna drive you.

96
00:10:26.960 --> 00:10:33.080
-I have back and knees pain ... -it's nothing!
 Don't do anything.

97
00:10:33.240 --> 00:10:38.240
Trust me now.
 25 cardboard is a lot to sit in a hunting tower.

98
00:10:38.400 --> 00:10:42.600
Well, no ... I don't know.
 Well...

99
00:10:42.760 --> 00:10:50.040
Then I thought we could have a small hunting party together.
 A team party.

100
00:10:50.200 --> 00:10:55.200
I put a little can on cooling at home, so that ...

101
00:10:57.360 --> 00:11:00.400
What are you saying?

102
00:11:02.640 --> 00:11:08.760
Teddy bear, are we going out into the forest now again?
 And hunt!

103
00:11:11.440 --> 00:11:18.040
Moose, all animals, hunter -wise ... deer we snap with.
 Clearly?

104
00:11:18.200 --> 00:11:22.240
-Yes!
 -Wonderfully.
 Shit hunting, then!

105
00:11:22.400 --> 00:11:25.360
-Hello guys!
 -Tjena, Anders.

106
00:11:25.520 --> 00:11:30.200
-Certainly the big day was here.
 -Hunting you?

107
00:11:30.360 --> 00:11:35.680
-So in hell!
 -It is good.
 You are on the rules?

108
00:11:35.840 --> 00:11:38.960
-Ole is unclear?
 -No, clear.

109
00:11:39.120 --> 00:11:45.320
Then you have the area between Bjäddal and large stone.
 It's just driving on.

110
00:11:45.480 --> 00:11:50.920
-Well then.
 Forward!
 -Lovely.
 Then we will see you then.

111
00:11:51.080 --> 00:11:54.320
Nämen, what ... check out.

112
00:12:03.120 --> 00:12:07.120
The c. sound dog grubes

113
00:12:03.120 --> 00:12:07.120
Yes, so.
 - Hey!

114
00:12:09.320 --> 00:12:11.640
Tjena, Anders.

115
00:12:11.800 --> 00:12:15.280
c. sounds coughs and harkles

116
00:12:15.440 --> 00:12:21.080
-Is it Billy's Bukkake Association?
 -Do you two join, right?

117
00:12:21.240 --> 00:12:25.880
You didn't think so, Leif Öhman as hunting leader.

118
00:12:26.040 --> 00:12:29.240
-No, it's unsupported.
 -You license, then?

119
00:12:29.400 --> 00:12:35.760
You do not need a license.
 Anders said it is enough if one of us has it.

120
00:12:35.920 --> 00:12:41.920
A hunting leader without a license and weapon is like a car without a tire.
 Are you kidding?

121
00:12:42.080 --> 00:12:45.080
-Do you know what a joke is?
 -Yes you.

122
00:12:45.240 --> 00:12:50.840
That you run around and recruit people who have barely got hair on the snoop.

123
00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:56.000
But you should work with the bun.
 You are in control of his little pilsner sausage.

124
00:12:56.160 --> 00:13:00.560
How fun!
 A standup comedian in the forest.

125
00:13:00.720 --> 00:13:04.520
Are you starting to be afraid of competition?

126
00:13:04.680 --> 00:13:10.280
Competition?
 You don't even have a weapon.
 Should you scare a squirrel?

127
00:13:10.440 --> 00:13:15.160
Should we go ... yes, we will hunt today.
 We'll go hunting.

128
00:13:15.320 --> 00:13:17.320
Let's go!

129
00:13:17.480 --> 00:13:20.720
Nice dog, hope it can do.

130
00:13:20.880 --> 00:13:26.160
-Er dog is also nice.
 -Yes, keep it connected.
 Fucking trams.

131
00:13:27.040 --> 00:13:30.120
Yes, good luck, then.

132
00:13:37.800 --> 00:13:41.640
Yes, good luck, Billy.

133
00:13:41.800 --> 00:13:44.840
-Come again now, the bun.
 -Billy, come now!

134
00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:47.440
No!

135
00:13:53.480 --> 00:13:57.280
-Oh!
 -So!
 Right leg.

136
00:13:57.440 --> 00:14:01.240
Right leg!
 Right!

137
00:14:03.640 --> 00:14:05.920
Cursed!

138
00:14:06.080 --> 00:14:10.560
C. soundball bargains

139
00:14:06.080 --> 00:14:10.560
But damn!
 Bull-fan!

140
00:14:10.720 --> 00:14:16.680
-The time, the intestines sometimes get lazy.
 -I do not want to hear.
 Move.

141
00:14:16.840 --> 00:14:22.120
-Do you not do I get up?
 -No, I see it.

142
00:14:22.280 --> 00:14:27.600
-So, here you can sit.
 There you have.
 -Thanks.

143
00:14:27.760 --> 00:14:34.240
So there, then I go down the left of the spruce planting.
 Take it easy now.

144
00:14:34.400 --> 00:14:37.720
Oh, oh, captain!

145
00:14:37.880 --> 00:14:41.080
Come then, Bamse.
 Teddy bear, come!

146
00:14:41.240 --> 00:14:43.840
Go, Bamse.

147
00:14:44.040 --> 00:14:50.000
C. sound shot

148
00:14:44.040 --> 00:14:50.000
Cursed, the bun!
 Hell!
 Cursed old man!

149
00:15:07.720 --> 00:15:11.160
-Billy to Tony.
 -Tony here, come.

150
00:15:11.320 --> 00:15:16.320
I was just going to see how it goes.
 Has Ozzy got something up?

151
00:15:16.480 --> 00:15:22.680
No, it's totally fucking dead here.
 He just walks around in circles so far.

152
00:15:22.840 --> 00:15:24.840
Okay.

153
00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:29.120
Come!
 Teddy bear, here.
 Search!
 Bamse ...

154
00:15:29.280 --> 00:15:32.160
Smell.
 Smell.

155
00:15:32.320 --> 00:15:35.280
C. soundlord

156
00:15:35.440 --> 00:15:38.760
Fuck off.

157
00:15:40.640 --> 00:15:44.880
Leif to the bun, come.
 Leif to the bun, come.

158
00:15:45.040 --> 00:15:47.720
C. soundball snores

159
00:15:47.880 --> 00:15:52.080
Hello?
 There is a big fucking bull here.

160
00:15:52.240 --> 00:15:54.800
Hello, the bun?

161
00:15:54.960 --> 00:15:57.440
Cursed.

162
00:15:58.080 --> 00:16:01.480
Okay, come on now.
 Look look.

163
00:16:01.640 --> 00:16:04.640
Look.
 There, go, attack.

164
00:16:04.800 --> 00:16:10.960
No, Bamse.
 No.
 Cursed.
 Attack, attack.

165
00:16:11.120 --> 00:16:14.200
Attack.
 No, damn.

166
00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:19.800
Hell's dog bastard!

167
00:16:25.640 --> 00:16:27.800
Cursed.

168
00:16:29.360 --> 00:16:31.840
Cursed.

169
00:16:35.760 --> 00:16:38.400
Stay, teddy bear.

170
00:16:41.280 --> 00:16:44.280
What the hell is he not shooting for?

171
00:16:46.120 --> 00:16:52.320
Slide, for fuck.
 There is a moose in front of you.
 75 m, an eight -tagger.

172
00:16:55.680 --> 00:16:58.520
Bullen, shoot!

173
00:16:59.440 --> 00:17:03.440
No, damn!
 - Bamse!

174
00:17:09.840 --> 00:17:14.560
That's not true.
 Cursed!

175
00:17:23.640 --> 00:17:29.040
-Ouch!
 What the hell are you doing?
 -What am I doing?

176
00:17:29.200 --> 00:17:34.400
I'm trying to hunt!
 I didn't know I was out with a narcoleptic-

177
00:17:34.560 --> 00:17:39.840
-Or which sleeps like a walrus and lets go by an eight -tagger!

178
00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:44.760
I didn't see that.
 I must have missed that.

179
00:17:44.920 --> 00:17:48.360
C. sound shot

180
00:17:51.160 --> 00:17:56.640
Well, it was Billy Öhman here.
 I have shot a big eight -tagger.

181
00:17:56.800 --> 00:17:59.800
Now we win the competition, guys.

182
00:18:00.680 --> 00:18:06.640
Well ... what fun, the bun, that it goes well for someone.

183
00:18:06.800 --> 00:18:11.680
-Cock!
 Satans ... -Yes, that ...

184
00:18:11.840 --> 00:18:15.480
-Congratulations!
 -Thanks.
 It feels good.

185
00:18:15.640 --> 00:18:21.520
I understand that.
 It's getting late.
 It feels like we have the winning gang.

186
00:18:21.680 --> 00:18:25.000
-Is that so?
 -You bastard!

187
00:18:25.160 --> 00:18:29.880
-Bra fixed with everything.
 -Thanks, fun to hear.

188
00:18:30.040 --> 00:18:34.920
No, but ... Leif!
 Help, for fuck.
 I'm stuck here.

189
00:18:35.080 --> 00:18:39.400
-Com here, teddy bear.
 -Help, I'm stuck!

190
00:18:43.520 --> 00:18:48.400
How is it going for the hunting leader, without a license and everything?

191
00:18:48.560 --> 00:18:50.560
Well, hello.

192
00:18:50.720 --> 00:18:55.640
What are you going to do now?
 Are you going home and throwing a butter knife?

193
00:18:55.800 --> 00:19:01.320
Yeah, or maybe I go home and fix the hair I have on the head-

194
00:19:01.480 --> 00:19:05.440
-Unlike other, damn eggs.

195
00:19:05.600 --> 00:19:11.440
Leif, shouldn't you congratulate Billy?
 Do you still have any hunting wit anyway?

196
00:19:11.600 --> 00:19:16.280
-Gruits, Billy.
 Well done.
 -Thanks.

197
00:19:16.440 --> 00:19:18.960
Reach?

198
00:19:19.120 --> 00:19:24.840
Yes ... wow, congratulations.
 So!
 Wow, how good you are, Billy.

199
00:19:25.000 --> 00:19:28.800
Take the dog bastard.
 It smells of piss.

200
00:19:28.960 --> 00:19:34.040
Lillbubben!
 Yes, how stupid he is.
 He says stupid things.

201
00:19:34.200 --> 00:19:39.320
-Do you go home, the bun?
 -No, I'll come, your bastard!

202
00:19:39.480 --> 00:19:42.880
-Do we celebrate?
 -Is the hunter on cooling?

203
00:19:43.040 --> 00:19:45.960
Yes, damn, and there are worn.

204
00:20:05.600 --> 00:20:08.080
Leif!

205
00:20:08.240 --> 00:20:10.240
What?

206
00:20:10.400 --> 00:20:15.560
We would have that party.
 You have put a can on cooling.

207
00:20:16.560 --> 00:20:23.360
My God ... Remove the dog from the car.
 It starts to smell breath and piss.

208
00:20:23.520 --> 00:20:28.720
C.Sang there are long, sad hours, c.Sangmenningless clichés

209
00:20:28.880 --> 00:20:31.920
C.Sangingen opens up

210
00:20:34.760 --> 00:20:39.960
C.Sangman just stares the plot c.Sangoch talking noise and laughs to

211
00:20:40.120 --> 00:20:43.200
c.Sangmen one gets used to

212
00:20:44.920 --> 00:20:48.320
C. soundlord

213
00:21:12.640 --> 00:21:15.120
Oh, damn.

214
00:21:15.280 --> 00:21:18.080
Fuck off.

215
00:21:18.240 --> 00:21:20.400
Damn.

216
00:21:22.600 --> 00:21:25.520
One quarter left, Leif.

217
00:21:25.680 --> 00:21:29.240
Yes, it is Leif for the bun here.

218
00:21:29.400 --> 00:21:33.680
-Leif to the bun, come.
 -Yes, the bun here.

219
00:21:33.840 --> 00:21:38.200
Take your fat asshole and pallet here with the rifle.

220
00:21:38.360 --> 00:21:42.400
Well, I'm sitting here in a foot bath, so ...

221
00:21:42.560 --> 00:21:48.040
Pall yourself here!
 There is a ten-tagger in the yard.
 Bring the rifle.

222
00:21:48.200 --> 00:21:52.680
It's an electric machine, I don't know how ...

223
00:21:52.840 --> 00:22:00.040
Take and come here.
 I have made the can here.
 We can have a party.
 Come here!

224
00:22:00.200 --> 00:22:03.280
Okay, Leif, I'll come.

225
00:22:03.440 --> 00:22:06.680
Your fucking slip.
 Damn!

226
00:22:09.200 --> 00:22:13.720
-Leif to Anders, the competition manager.
 -Anders here.

227
00:22:13.880 --> 00:22:19.320
We have a ten -tagger who is dead on my farm.
 We have a new winner.

228
00:22:19.480 --> 00:22:23.920
-You can come here.
 -What the hell, are you sure?

229
00:22:24.080 --> 00:22:29.280
I'm sure.
 He is here in the yard.
 Come here right away.

230
00:22:57.880 --> 00:23:00.680
c. soundduns

231
00:23:06.440 --> 00:23:09.600
No!
 No, no, no, damn.

232
00:23:09.760 --> 00:23:15.560
Where is it?
 Are we ... am I late?
 After all, I had to ...

233
00:23:15.720 --> 00:23:20.960
What the hell!
 What have you done?
 Have you killed the white moose?

234
00:23:21.120 --> 00:23:24.120
Yes, you don't have to remind me.

235
00:23:24.280 --> 00:23:28.480
-Is it an arrow?
 -Can ask so much!

236
00:23:28.640 --> 00:23:34.440
-Now we have to find out this.
 -This you get to take care of yourself, Leif.

237
00:23:34.600 --> 00:23:38.840
Listen, the bun!
 This is your fault.

238
00:23:39.000 --> 00:23:44.440
Had you not slept in the hunting tower, I would not have been so stressed.

239
00:23:44.600 --> 00:23:47.520
Hello guys.

240
00:23:49.080 --> 00:23:52.600
-Tjena, Anders.
 -Where do you have it?

241
00:23:52.760 --> 00:23:58.400
The bun had been drinking.
 We thought he was shooting, but he missed.

242
00:23:58.560 --> 00:24:02.920
-He is full, Gubbfan.
 -Move.

243
00:24:03.080 --> 00:24:07.320
Listen, Anders ... I can explain.

244
00:24:09.320 --> 00:24:11.920
Fy fuck, Leif.

245
00:24:12.080 --> 00:24:17.240
Yes, okay!
 I killed it.
 It was running into the kitchen.

246
00:24:17.400 --> 00:24:20.600
I defended myself.

247
00:24:21.520 --> 00:24:27.080
Now that I think about it, it has ten tags, more than eight ...

248
00:24:27.240 --> 00:24:33.800
You, a lot of fucking shit you have heard of, but this is the hell.

249
00:24:44.680 --> 00:24:46.920
Damn.

250
00:25:05.080 --> 00:25:09.240
c. sounded whistles

251
00:25:09.400 --> 00:25:15.400
I could not choose between Vesuvio and Sörbäcken Special.
 I took both.

252
00:25:18.160 --> 00:25:24.080
Fy fuck, brother.
 It is not every day we both are on the front page.

253
00:25:24.240 --> 00:25:26.440
Huh?

254
00:25:32.080 --> 00:25:36.040
I know damn if I can both.

255
00:25:36.200 --> 00:25:40.840
-You don't want one?
 -I would like to...

256
00:25:41.000 --> 00:25:48.600
Yes, the pizza salad.
 I will have the pizzas myself.
 You can get one.

257
00:25:48.760 --> 00:25:51.800
Well, which one should you start with?
