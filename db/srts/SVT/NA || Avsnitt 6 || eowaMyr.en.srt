1
00:00:04.600 --> 00:00:09.240
In tonight's section of Ifs - immigrants for Swedes:

2
00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:12.640
Police who do not want to teach their children Arabic: Nadim Ghazale.

3
00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:16.240
Skåne's moral conscience: Petrina Solange.

4
00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:19.120
The Roma Jewish horse dealer: Chang Frick.

5
00:00:19.280 --> 00:00:23.040
Pandemin's hardest working influencer: Antonija Mandir.

6
00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:26.800
Sweden's second best celebrity dancer: Filip Dikmen.

7
00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:29.880
Don't forget Sweden's most fun Chinese: Evelyn Mok.

8
00:00:30.040 --> 00:00:33.280
Rinkeby's own Harry Potter: Daniel Sanchez.

9
00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:35.960
The world's Swedish Arab: Elaf Ali.

10
00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:38.280
Greek from Alby: Thanos Fotas.

11
00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:42.960
The Kurd who speaks better German than Swedish: Incredible Big O.

12
00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:49.120
Last but not least: Our unanimous program manager Ahmed Berhan!

13
00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:51.400
Welcome to IFS.

14
00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:55.360
The program with more diversity than the Migration Board's repository.

15
00:00:55.520 --> 00:01:00.840
My name is Ahmed Berhan.
 You see the quiz about all culture in Sweden.

16
00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:10.160
Keep up that applause for our competitors: Niklas, Sofia and Fredrik!

17
00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:16.680
The contestant chooses one in the panel that I ask another question.

18
00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:20.760
The contestants decide whether the panelists are lying or not.

19
00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:27.720
In the end, it is the two with the most points that advance to the final!

20
00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:34.200
Backstage we drew about who can start.

21
00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:37.280
That's a small advantage.

22
00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:41.720
The one who won was no less than Sofia!

23
00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:49.640
- Sofia, you are a researcher.
 -Yes.

24
00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:56.080
Can it help you decide if the panelists' hypotheses are correct?

25
00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:59.600
No, not the least.

26
00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:03.760
- Are you good at reading people?
 -Quite.

27
00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:08.520
Then we'll see.
 Which panelist do you start with?

28
00:02:08.680 --> 00:02:11.440
–Evelyn.
 -Ah!

29
00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:18.080
The relationship between me and my dildo.

30
00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:23.120
- It's fun, because it's true.
 -It's true.

31
00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:26.640
No, but a pleasure marriage ...

32
00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:31.320
Japan has strange sexual inclinations.

33
00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:35.720
But it is illegal to have sex with animal -

34
00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:40.120
- Unless you marry the animal first.

35
00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:46.720
It's called Genki Kekkon.
 It is a pleasure marriage.

36
00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:51.560
- It was your answer?
 - She sounded skeptical.

37
00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:55.360
- What do you feel, Sofia?
 - Lite sick.

38
00:02:55.520 --> 00:03:00.080
- Have you been to Japan?
 -No not yet.

39
00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:03.480
I say it's false.

40
00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:08.320
You are doing absolutely right.
 Congratulations!
 You've received your first point!

41
00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:11.920
Thanks.

42
00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:16.840
It is a disputed rule within shia-islam-

43
00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:22.880
- There is an imam wig and woman to make temporary sex halal.

44
00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:27.120
It would have been fun if you got to marry an animal.

45
00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:30.520
Imagine poison at first sight.

46
00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:36.560
"I don't know, maybe a woman or a turtle. Exciting."

47
00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:42.280
- Is it going on TV4 or Animal Planet?
 -Both.

48
00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:48.880
Congratulations to the first point, Sofia.

49
00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:54.320
- Fredrik, entered the match.
 - I want to ... - Filip, help me.

50
00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:56.840
-Yo, sir!
 - Filip.

51
00:03:58.720 --> 00:04:02.040
The sequel to Jumanji.

52
00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:09.120
Sorani and Kurmanji are Kurdish version of Adam and Eva.

53
00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:14.560
First man and woman on earth.
 Sorani is the woman, Kurmanji the man.

54
00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:18.200
- Developed version of it.
 -Absolutely.

55
00:04:18.360 --> 00:04:23.560
You believe in Filip?
 - Fredrik thinks what Filip says is true.

56
00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:26.440
You are wrong.

57
00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:31.440
The two largest Kurdish dialects are Sorani and Kurmanji.

58
00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:34.680
Good.
 Thanks!

59
00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:44.480
- Niklas, how does it feel?
 -Good!
 I decided a long time ago.

60
00:04:44.640 --> 00:04:49.080
- What have you decided on?
 - Big o, put your hands up.

61
00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:53.800
My brother.
 I'll help.

62
00:04:55.400 --> 00:04:57.120
Big o ...

63
00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:04.240
When a Muslim Bakk on a deed, he greets from the heart.

64
00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:08.360
"You're mine. I'll yan you tonight."
 No, brother!

65
00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:14.080
No, Muslims greet from the heart to avoid physical contact.

66
00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:17.760
–The'rå.
 - Well!

67
00:05:17.920 --> 00:05:22.680
- Do you understand or should I repeat?
 - I say it's false.

68
00:05:22.840 --> 00:05:26.160
You think it's false.
 Why don't you trust Big O?

69
00:05:26.320 --> 00:05:32.000
- He is unreliable.
 - Then he chose you first.

70
00:05:32.160 --> 00:05:36.080
But it feels ... that's not true.

71
00:05:36.240 --> 00:05:42.560
Big o is unreliable.
 O Too unreliable.
 - Niklas, you are wrong.

72
00:05:42.720 --> 00:05:47.640
Muslims greet their hearts to avoid physical contact.

73
00:05:47.800 --> 00:05:52.760
I thought they put my hand on the heart because they are always offended.

74
00:05:52.920 --> 00:05:57.320
"Oh, oh!"
 They walk around so every day.

75
00:05:59.520 --> 00:06:01.520
Oh!

76
00:06:01.680 --> 00:06:04.320
Unfortunately no points.

77
00:06:04.480 --> 00:06:09.040
Sofia, you have the lead.
 Can you get one more point?

78
00:06:09.200 --> 00:06:11.200
Yeah.
 Here we go.

79
00:06:11.360 --> 00:06:14.000
Eh ... Petrina.

80
00:06:14.160 --> 00:06:18.240
Suheib Saleh played drug addicts most of all.

81
00:06:22.560 --> 00:06:25.600
He played the gangster type -

82
00:06:25.760 --> 00:06:31.800
- And advertised a digital healthcare service.
 A journalist thought:

83
00:06:31.960 --> 00:06:37.640
"You can't be an actor and advertise care services."

84
00:06:37.800 --> 00:06:42.840
He was not allowed to be a gangster and advertise care.
 So they got sour.

85
00:06:45.480 --> 00:06:49.560
Do you say that Muslims are offended?

86
00:06:49.720 --> 00:06:53.840
It sounds like a reasonable thing that may have happened.

87
00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:58.120
The question is whether it is too easy to be true.

88
00:06:58.280 --> 00:07:05.200
- His research brain started now.
 - I say it's true.

89
00:07:05.360 --> 00:07:09.160
Just right.
 You've got one more point.

90
00:07:12.640 --> 00:07:18.080
The easily offended journalist from Summary could not have two balls -

91
00:07:18.240 --> 00:07:23.120
- When he saw the actor who played drug addicts in advertising for drugs.

92
00:07:23.280 --> 00:07:25.440
He wrote an article about it.

93
00:07:25.600 --> 00:07:28.480
Fredrik, do you want to get into the match?

94
00:07:28.640 --> 00:07:32.280
-Obvious.
 - Who in the panel are you choosing?

95
00:07:34.320 --> 00:07:37.120
-Thanos.
 -Yes.

96
00:07:42.680 --> 00:07:45.720
The words cannot be translated directly.

97
00:07:45.880 --> 00:07:47.920
Then you explain with a sentence.

98
00:07:48.080 --> 00:07:53.080
Inshallah means "most likely no".

99
00:07:53.240 --> 00:07:58.560
You meet an old friend.
 "We'll have a coffee one day?"
 - "Inshallah."

100
00:07:58.720 --> 00:08:03.880
Or type season 2 of immigrants for Swedes.
 "Will it get rid of?"

101
00:08:04.040 --> 00:08:07.200
Eh ... "Inshallah."

102
00:08:09.280 --> 00:08:13.560
You can apply it in a lot of different contexts.

103
00:08:14.480 --> 00:08:16.520
Yes...

104
00:08:16.680 --> 00:08:22.280
The examples you radi up can definitely fit into it.

105
00:08:22.440 --> 00:08:26.440
But the explanation for the expression itself is wrong.

106
00:08:26.600 --> 00:08:29.480
You will believe that if you want.

107
00:08:29.640 --> 00:08:35.760
Inshallah that you get a point.
 Obviously it's false!

108
00:08:36.640 --> 00:08:39.920
What good, what good!

109
00:08:40.080 --> 00:08:46.720
Inshallah means "if God wants".
 God wanted you to get a point.

110
00:08:46.880 --> 00:08:49.640
- Niklas?
 - I have to move up.

111
00:08:49.800 --> 00:08:53.040
- What are you taking?
 –Alaf.

112
00:09:06.400 --> 00:09:09.200
They panicked to be there.

113
00:09:10.800 --> 00:09:17.520
No, but the truth is that they were there because they did PR ...

114
00:09:17.680 --> 00:09:21.040
... to calm the immigrants.

115
00:09:21.200 --> 00:09:26.400
The laser man ravaged Sweden and shot a lot of foreigners.

116
00:09:26.560 --> 00:09:30.080
That's right.
 Totally convinced.

117
00:09:30.240 --> 00:09:34.040
- Are you there?
 -No.

118
00:09:34.200 --> 00:09:38.320
Congratulations, Niklas.
 You've received your first point.

119
00:09:41.640 --> 00:09:46.600
No matter how sick it sounds, in 1992 it became noisy in Rinkeby's People's House.

120
00:09:46.760 --> 00:09:50.480
Then Birgit thought you would sing a little.

121
00:09:50.640 --> 00:09:55.480
- Congratulations to the point.
 - They got angry when people didn't sing.

122
00:09:55.640 --> 00:09:59.720
- They couldn't know the text.
 - They could not Swedish.

123
00:09:59.880 --> 00:10:04.120
- The song is in English.
 - They couldn't either.

124
00:10:10.240 --> 00:10:13.640
All competitors have points, but Sofia has two.

125
00:10:13.800 --> 00:10:17.040
- Should we skip to three?
 -Yes.

126
00:10:17.200 --> 00:10:23.680
It has been so good with The Ladies, so I continue there.
 - Sorry, Boys.

127
00:10:23.840 --> 00:10:26.120
So Antonija.

128
00:10:35.960 --> 00:10:41.400
He assumed that he was going to play in a new, Turkish club.

129
00:10:41.560 --> 00:10:46.560
It made his dear Syrian home fans flipped out.

130
00:10:49.320 --> 00:10:52.760
- No, that's not true.
 -Okay.

131
00:10:52.920 --> 00:10:59.360
-Not?
 Because you know that ...?
 -It was well during the World Cup.

132
00:10:59.520 --> 00:11:04.680
I don't really remember what happened, but it wasn't.

133
00:11:04.840 --> 00:11:07.400
- Are you absolutely sure?
 -Quite.

134
00:11:07.560 --> 00:11:13.400
- Trot that Antonija did that mine?
 - You were convincing in every way.

135
00:11:13.560 --> 00:11:16.240
But it was false.

136
00:11:16.400 --> 00:11:20.640
Just right, Sofia.
 You've received your third point.

137
00:11:23.040 --> 00:11:26.200
That's what you were in: The World Cup.

138
00:11:26.360 --> 00:11:31.960
He did so Germany got a free kick in the final minutes and scored goals.

139
00:11:32.120 --> 00:11:36.360
We lost by 2-1.
 Some blamed his Syrian background.

140
00:11:36.520 --> 00:11:39.840
With all rights!

141
00:11:40.920 --> 00:11:46.000
Congratulations to the point, Sofia.
 - Fredrik, it's your turn now.

142
00:11:48.560 --> 00:11:51.080
I think ... Sanchez.

143
00:11:51.240 --> 00:11:56.600
-Are you ready?
 -Absolutely.
 Obvious.

144
00:11:58.200 --> 00:12:00.280
Time for a picture question.

145
00:12:04.440 --> 00:12:09.240
The first girl who does not believe in zodiac signs.

146
00:12:15.960 --> 00:12:18.800
She is a Swedish artist and dancer -

147
00:12:18.960 --> 00:12:24.160
- And first woman over 30 who dated Leonardo DiCaprio.

148
00:12:27.680 --> 00:12:29.520
Yes...

149
00:12:31.840 --> 00:12:34.480
It can sue everything.

150
00:12:34.640 --> 00:12:40.880
But I was hesitant that Leonardo has dated someone over 30.

151
00:12:41.040 --> 00:12:44.280
No.
 I say it's false.

152
00:12:44.440 --> 00:12:49.000
-Are you sure?
 - No, but it's false.

153
00:12:49.160 --> 00:12:53.200
Of course, you do that right in.

154
00:12:56.360 --> 00:13:00.920
False.
 Elli Avram is the first Swede to play in a Bollywood movie.

155
00:13:01.080 --> 00:13:05.440
- Niklas, do you know what is happening now?
 - I must be right.

156
00:13:05.600 --> 00:13:11.240
Unfortunately, if you do not collect points now, you will not move on to the final.

157
00:13:11.400 --> 00:13:15.440
So try not to do away with you.

158
00:13:15.600 --> 00:13:20.520
- Chang avoids eye contact.
 - Very good choice.

159
00:13:26.560 --> 00:13:31.240
They accused him of being Kurd but he is Turk.

160
00:13:33.560 --> 00:13:39.720
They had written that he had spent three years for drug offenses.

161
00:13:39.880 --> 00:13:45.760
But another Babbe was called the same.
 They took the wrong black skull, you know.

162
00:13:45.920 --> 00:13:51.200
Then they got to poodle.
 Happens easily.
 Been there, done that.

163
00:13:53.160 --> 00:13:57.880
I didn't know it at all.
 I have to go on your credibility.

164
00:13:58.040 --> 00:14:00.480
- Are you lit on a one like me?
 -Yes.

165
00:14:00.640 --> 00:14:03.960
Who the hell trust Chang?!

166
00:14:04.120 --> 00:14:10.360
We live in a ding ding world.
 You did absolutely right to trust Chang.

167
00:14:16.520 --> 00:14:22.440
Sofia, it's your turn now.
 You have the chance to get a full pot.

168
00:14:22.600 --> 00:14:27.880
-Cruelly.
 Do you think you nail it?
 -Yes, I think so.

169
00:14:28.040 --> 00:14:31.920
- Night, now we drive.
 -Just right.

170
00:14:35.680 --> 00:14:41.000
I deliver.
 Green is the favorite color, blonde women are my favorite breed.

171
00:14:42.640 --> 00:14:46.360
He's not even lying.

172
00:14:55.760 --> 00:14:57.800
In fact, I know this.

173
00:14:57.960 --> 00:15:02.640
Half came to Borås, Hässleholmen, and the other half I have arrested.

174
00:15:02.800 --> 00:15:07.320
I know they come from 160, 150 countries.

175
00:15:07.480 --> 00:15:11.760
–160, 150 countries?
 –150, 160 approx.

176
00:15:11.920 --> 00:15:15.440
It is tricky, but absolutely reasonable.

177
00:15:15.600 --> 00:15:22.200
- Senipers come here, from there ... - than half were my cousins.

178
00:15:22.360 --> 00:15:25.720
No, but I believe in Nadim.

179
00:15:25.880 --> 00:15:30.560
Sofia, congratulations.
 You've got a full pot.

180
00:15:34.120 --> 00:15:36.960
The competition was no play for you.

181
00:15:37.120 --> 00:15:41.120
The best thing that happened now, except Sofia went to the final -

182
00:15:41.280 --> 00:15:45.000
- Is we find out who comes with you there.

183
00:15:45.160 --> 00:15:49.080
It's time for the rash issue.

184
00:15:55.640 --> 00:16:00.800
I ask the question, you write down your answer to your little trays -

185
00:16:00.960 --> 00:16:04.960
- And then you hold up the answer.
 Closest to wins.

186
00:16:09.200 --> 00:16:12.800
/LAUGH/

187
00:16:16.560 --> 00:16:20.240
- Do you feel ready?
 -Yes.

188
00:16:20.400 --> 00:16:25.240
The question was: How many IKEA department stores are there in Africa?
 Closest to wins.

189
00:16:25.400 --> 00:16:28.680
Niklas and Fredrik, show your answers.

190
00:16:28.840 --> 00:16:32.920
-Oh oh oh!
 - What a big difference!

191
00:16:33.080 --> 00:16:36.840
–1.
 - Why in hell you take 1?

192
00:16:38.280 --> 00:16:41.320
- It may be 1. - did you know why?
 He wanted to win.

193
00:16:41.480 --> 00:16:45.160
Congratulations, Niklas!
 You are closest.

194
00:16:45.320 --> 00:16:51.120
The correct answer is five department stores.
 They are located in Morocco and in Egypt.

195
00:16:51.280 --> 00:16:55.640
A sixth is underway in Morocco.
 - Niklas, you made it to the final.

196
00:16:55.800 --> 00:17:01.440
Sofia, you have made it to the final.
 - Thanks, Fredrik, for joining you.

197
00:17:05.720 --> 00:17:11.400
Now we drive the first to five.
 Gather them as quickly as possible.

198
00:17:11.560 --> 00:17:14.520
But there is a small twist.

199
00:17:14.680 --> 00:17:19.840
If you answer wrong, the opponent will receive a point.

200
00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:25.560
Sofia, you had a full pot and won.
 Then you start the final round.

201
00:17:25.720 --> 00:17:28.280
Ah!
 Again!

202
00:17:28.440 --> 00:17:33.680
I'll take Evelyn again.
 It went so well last time.

203
00:17:39.120 --> 00:17:42.800
A good basketball player in Afghanistan.

204
00:17:43.880 --> 00:17:47.680
I know his name.
 Usama bin Lay-up.

205
00:17:52.120 --> 00:17:57.080
No, it's actually something that Ahmed knows very well.

206
00:17:57.240 --> 00:18:02.680
- It's a type of hash.
 -Tell me more.

207
00:18:02.840 --> 00:18:05.360
Oh my God.
 Popo!

208
00:18:05.520 --> 00:18:10.760
It's a type of hash.
 It is very soft, a little dark.

209
00:18:10.920 --> 00:18:16.680
Afghan in the name comes from being grown in the Afghan mountains.

210
00:18:16.840 --> 00:18:20.040
It has a dominant indica-stain-

211
00:18:20.200 --> 00:18:25.720
- which gives a very nice, relaxing and uplifting high.

212
00:18:25.880 --> 00:18:31.040
- Therefore, people like it.
 - Is that why I get munchies?

213
00:18:31.200 --> 00:18:34.800
-I think so.
 - It was difficult.

214
00:18:34.960 --> 00:18:39.240
Some things are grown in the mountains in Afghanistan.

215
00:18:39.400 --> 00:18:43.840
-How do you know that?
 -Researcher.

216
00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:48.160
-"Researcher".
 - It is difficult, that is.

217
00:18:48.320 --> 00:18:52.320
But ... we say so.
 I trust you.
 True!

218
00:18:52.480 --> 00:18:58.720
You trust Evelyn?
 Black Afghan is a hash that is grown in the mountains?

219
00:18:58.880 --> 00:19:04.920
We are in Afghanistan.
 Kush Mountains.
 Third mountain from the right.

220
00:19:06.120 --> 00:19:08.600
Sofia ...

221
00:19:08.760 --> 00:19:13.800
Congratulations!
 You got your first point in the final round.

222
00:19:17.040 --> 00:19:23.040
Black Afghan is a specific hash variety from Afghanistan.
 Allegedly.

223
00:19:23.200 --> 00:19:26.800
- Taking Notes.
 - Niklas, your turn.

224
00:19:26.960 --> 00:19:31.880
- Review.
 Big o, come on now.
 - Otherwise you have to do this.

225
00:19:34.520 --> 00:19:38.880
You trust me, otherwise you will not get a kebab roll.

226
00:19:43.560 --> 00:19:48.080
It's Kim Kardashian's body measure.

227
00:19:50.440 --> 00:19:54.920
What happened halfway to the body when you ...?

228
00:19:55.080 --> 00:19:58.400
I was with you here, but this one?

229
00:19:58.560 --> 00:20:03.080
Are you sure you don't think about Caitlyn Jenner?

230
00:20:03.240 --> 00:20:10.240
What the fuck oh are you ate?
 It was a good, fucking joke!

231
00:20:12.880 --> 00:20:17.200
Okay, no, that 6-24 something ...

232
00:20:18.240 --> 00:20:22.360
It is one of the Old Testament -

233
00:20:22.520 --> 00:20:27.120
–Mest controversy ... controversial verses.

234
00:20:27.280 --> 00:20:30.120
Good, sfi!

235
00:20:34.720 --> 00:20:37.440
Big O, have you smoked black Afghan before?

236
00:20:37.600 --> 00:20:44.000
It is the Old Testament's most controversial verse with the phrase:

237
00:20:44.160 --> 00:20:50.480
"Thank you, God, for not creating me as a woman for the guys."
 Huh!

238
00:20:54.960 --> 00:20:57.560
It would have been worse.

239
00:20:57.720 --> 00:21:03.280
- What do you say, Niklas?
 - It's either ...

240
00:21:04.560 --> 00:21:07.640
Or it is when Big o is born.

241
00:21:07.800 --> 00:21:10.840
–Wa?
 –24 June 1990.

242
00:21:11.000 --> 00:21:17.360
- No, that's not true.
 - brother, in the homeland I am forty.

243
00:21:26.840 --> 00:21:29.880
I trust you, Big O.

244
00:21:30.040 --> 00:21:34.000
You should definitely not have done that.
 It's false.

245
00:21:34.160 --> 00:21:38.240
6-24-90 describes the requirements for the Home Guard's crisis preparedness.

246
00:21:38.400 --> 00:21:42.320
It should be running in 6 hours, fully active within 24–

247
00:21:42.480 --> 00:21:48.680
- And last for 90 days.
 There were no points.
 You know what that means.

248
00:21:48.840 --> 00:21:53.280
- Sofia, you got a free score.
 - TACKS.

249
00:21:53.440 --> 00:21:56.720
Sofia is fatal.
 Ice cold.

250
00:21:56.880 --> 00:22:01.280
Check her eyes.
 She looks like a shark.

251
00:22:02.800 --> 00:22:04.800
No but...

252
00:22:04.960 --> 00:22:09.960
Karen view.
 You are about to call the boss anytime.

253
00:22:10.120 --> 00:22:14.520
It's no Karen.
 She has lived with blats.
 She has lived.

254
00:22:14.680 --> 00:22:20.400
–And noted.
 She has put us in ... --... experimental cages.

255
00:22:20.560 --> 00:22:24.960
-Just.
 - "They eat like ordinary people."

256
00:22:25.120 --> 00:22:31.160
"They experience love. They experience grief and pain in injury."

257
00:22:31.320 --> 00:22:34.400
/APPLAUSE/

258
00:22:37.680 --> 00:22:40.600
–Alaf.
 –Yes.

259
00:22:40.760 --> 00:22:45.800
At Indian restaurant you can order lamb, chicken, but not beef.

260
00:22:49.240 --> 00:22:52.000
Skåne: Jeo, but Keon ...

261
00:22:52.160 --> 00:22:56.360
- Keeeeoon!
 - Serve it again, Elaf.

262
00:22:56.520 --> 00:22:59.000
Nothing wrong to talk Seu after all.

263
00:22:59.160 --> 00:23:02.720
Is it ugly with Kristianstad dialect?

264
00:23:02.880 --> 00:23:06.160
We are a chamber team.
 The cow is sacred-

265
00:23:06.320 --> 00:23:12.520
- For you mean that the gods and goddesses live in it.

266
00:23:12.680 --> 00:23:15.120
So everything with the cow is sacred.

267
00:23:15.280 --> 00:23:22.000
Even its kiss and poop are used in religious ceremonies.

268
00:23:22.160 --> 00:23:26.720
-Yes it's true.
 - Pan.

269
00:23:26.880 --> 00:23:30.720
-I believe in you.
 - Have you eaten a Kiss and poop?

270
00:23:30.880 --> 00:23:36.920
No.
 But consultation is sacred, one must not touch it, in Hinduism.

271
00:23:37.080 --> 00:23:41.640
- I think it's true.
 - It felt like you taught us.

272
00:23:41.800 --> 00:23:45.000
-Yes, teaacher!
 - It was not included in the fact.

273
00:23:45.160 --> 00:23:48.640
But congratulations, you got one more point.

274
00:23:53.480 --> 00:23:56.960
- Niklas ... —Mm.

275
00:23:57.120 --> 00:24:00.880
Now it's starting to be ... Antonija, I think.

276
00:24:01.040 --> 00:24:04.400
- Niklas!
 -Absolutely.

277
00:24:12.280 --> 00:24:17.160
I am Croat and have grown up with my parents told me:

278
00:24:17.320 --> 00:24:20.840
Unless you listen to us and do as we say -

279
00:24:21.000 --> 00:24:25.920
- Will Babaroga, a great aunt, and kidnap you.

280
00:24:26.080 --> 00:24:28.560
I'm scared even today.

281
00:24:28.720 --> 00:24:33.000
- When did they last say that?
 -Yesterday.

282
00:24:33.160 --> 00:24:37.240
When Antonija told me she would be here.

283
00:24:37.400 --> 00:24:40.480
Never heard of, but that's not true.

284
00:24:40.640 --> 00:24:43.800
Antonija spoke truth.

285
00:24:43.960 --> 00:24:48.120
- Niklas!
 - It's as sick as possible.

286
00:24:48.280 --> 00:24:54.080
- Still anyway, it feels very Balkans.
 -Yes.
 They talk so much crap.

287
00:24:54.240 --> 00:25:01.360
- What do Swedes threaten the children with?
 - They have to wait for the room without food.

288
00:25:08.480 --> 00:25:12.960
Niklas, you answered wrong.
 You know what that means.

289
00:25:13.120 --> 00:25:16.520
Sofia got one more point.

290
00:25:19.760 --> 00:25:24.000
Because Niklas answered wrong, you got a free score.

291
00:25:24.160 --> 00:25:28.640
If you answer correctly now you have not only swept first round -

292
00:25:28.800 --> 00:25:31.960
- Without the entire program and won the entire competition.

293
00:25:32.120 --> 00:25:35.280
Then it becomes Petrina.

294
00:25:42.520 --> 00:25:46.320
One takes a hood over the main - main

295
00:25:46.480 --> 00:25:49.720
- And film that execution.

296
00:25:49.880 --> 00:25:55.600
Then you write it on VHSs that you sell.

297
00:25:55.760 --> 00:25:59.720
Then comes the American intervention force and kills the butcher -

298
00:25:59.880 --> 00:26:05.680
- And dumps his body in the sea.
 A large cost to taxpayers.

299
00:26:06.800 --> 00:26:11.800
But then you wanted it, so you got it.

300
00:26:15.640 --> 00:26:21.600
No.
 A Muslim person reads a prayer, turns the animal towards Mecca.
 Bam!

301
00:26:21.760 --> 00:26:25.200
Then you slaughter it just like all other animals.

302
00:26:25.360 --> 00:26:30.080
- Sofia?
 - It can definitely be true.

303
00:26:30.240 --> 00:26:34.720
I might mix up how to slaughter animals.

304
00:26:34.880 --> 00:26:40.600
In some religions one must not have anesthetic.
 Such things.

305
00:26:40.760 --> 00:26:46.680
But in Sweden you have other ways of ... hm.

306
00:26:46.840 --> 00:26:52.880
That's the question.
 This was a Swedish way?
 I have no idea.

307
00:26:53.040 --> 00:26:58.200
I guess it's right.
 You speak the truth.

308
00:26:58.360 --> 00:27:00.440
-You know what?
 -Wrong?

309
00:27:00.600 --> 00:27:03.880
You were right.

310
00:27:04.680 --> 00:27:08.600
Sofia is our winner!
 A big applause!

311
00:27:13.120 --> 00:27:16.280
Come on here, Sofia.
 Come come!

312
00:27:18.440 --> 00:27:22.960
Sofia is our winner who swept the first round.

313
00:27:24.120 --> 00:27:28.240
A diploma to hang up and a flower.

314
00:27:28.400 --> 00:27:32.320
Thank you so much to our competitors, to the audience -

315
00:27:32.480 --> 00:27:37.000
- To you at home and not least our panel.

316
00:27:38.040 --> 00:27:40.880
See you when we see you.

317
00:27:44.440 --> 00:27:47.400
