00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:15.360
Radio: "A Rose in Summer" is called this nice melody -

2
00:00:15.520 --> 00:00:21.520
- And one autumn morning it is nice to think about brighter times.

3
00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:26.480
- What a nice thing it is to clean!
 - Yes, lovely.

4
00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:32.000
I remove our old websites with ads.

5
00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:35.520
Do you remember your massage course, Leif?

6
00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:40.640
It came here a thick aunt that you took on your butt!

7
00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:44.160
Yes!
 Remove the picture.

8
00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:50.200
- God, this one!
 Drejkurs with Leif ... - Set Larva you!
 Remove that.

9
00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:53.800
Yes, calm down!

10
00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:59.200
-Check this out!
 -Stop.
 I can't cope anymore now.

11
00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:04.760
Yes, for real!
 Someone has written to us.

12
00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:13.320
Check!
 "We are two guys who want to sign up for your wilderness course."

13
00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:17.680
- When did they write it?
 - For two weeks ago.

14
00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:22.320
Damn, then it's too late.
 We would have needed the money!

15
00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:28.360
But I think I have autos in the e -mail.
 Check!

16
00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:33.440
Screw me.
 They are coming!
 When then?
 When the hell are they coming?

17
00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:36.480
I'll see ... the twelfth!

18
00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:42.400
- Tolf ... it's today!
 -It sure is?!

19
00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:47.000
- Then we have to start packing.
 - But we will ...

20
00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:50.440
It's done!
 2,000 bucks.

21
00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:58.200
C.Teletext.urfjarrandsags for news.
 The tension between Sweden, Finland and Russia is increasing.

22
00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:06.640
Where should we be?
 Not here in the forest, well, after everything with the neighbor?

23
00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:11.720
We take a walk to Finland.
 There no one knows who we are.

24
00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:18.160
C.Tetetext.urfjarningen is still unclear what Russia wants with this mark.

25
00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:27.360
C.Teletext.urfjarran private persons are recommended to stay from the border areas.

26
00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:49.320
-Hey!
 Hello.
 Lucas.
 - Jonas.

27
00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:55.920
Well, Leif Öman, course instructor.
 Here is the little brother Billy.

28
00:02:56.080 --> 00:02:59.200
Deputy cone ... Strankör.

29
00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:05.680
- fun to be here!
 - It's really nice here.

30
00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:12.760
We divide the course into two parts.
 An animal tracking, then a fight exercise.

31
00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:18.920
- A fight exercise?
 - Yes, an animal attack maneuver, type.

32
00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:24.200
- A shooting exercise.
 - Self -defense against game.

33
00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:30.080
If you are getting ready, we start going, simply.

34
00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:40.720
- Jonas, this doesn't feel good.
 - We test!
 We can finish tomorrow.

35
00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:44.560
Rap on now!
 We have a long way to go.

36
00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:49.560
Come on now.
 It is far to Finland.

37
00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:54.680
Finland?!
 Haven't you heard on the news?

38
00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:58.760
Wrong speed!
 We have a long way to go.

39
00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:19.120
Stay here with Billy.
 I'll go and find a campsite.

40
00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:22.560
- Are you thirsty?
 -Yes.

41
00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:26.000
Then we fix it.

42
00:04:27.920 --> 00:04:30.920
Thanks.

43
00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:37.720
Honestly, is this safe?
 Shouldn't we go back to Sörbäcken?

44
00:04:37.880 --> 00:04:42.200
- You have land there?
 -Yes.

45
00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:49.600
But we have had a mess with the neighbors - no, the spruces there.
 They have viruses.

46
00:04:49.760 --> 00:04:55.560
It's not good to be there.
 And the ground is finer in Finland.

47
00:04:55.920 --> 00:04:59.920
C.Teletext.kudskylk.kudwalkie-Talkien speaks

48
00:04:58.680 --> 00:05:05.480
- Billy here, come.
 - Go northeast, you will find me.

49
00:05:05.640 --> 00:05:10.840
We're coming.
 Over and out!
 - We go down.

50
00:05:20.440 --> 00:05:27.000
Well, time for tracking course.
 What is most important?
 Animal waste analysis!

51
00:05:27.160 --> 00:05:31.920
Animal bait is not difficult.
 We learned that in elementary school.

52
00:05:32.080 --> 00:05:37.120
This is not a school, but reality.

53
00:05:37.280 --> 00:05:42.800
- Will we get to see Björnbajs today?
 - Trequent.

54
00:05:42.960 --> 00:05:49.320
But here we have something.
 What is this, do you think?

55
00:05:49.480 --> 00:05:54.320
-Hare.
 -Yes.
 The outside looks like harlos.

56
00:05:54.480 --> 00:05:58.680
But if you crack it you see the condition of the hare.

57
00:05:58.840 --> 00:06:05.440
Quite cold, moist.
 Lots of fiber.
 You can see - a prosperous hare.

58
00:06:05.600 --> 00:06:08.640
We'll see here ... HEP!

59
00:06:08.800 --> 00:06:14.880
Now it is getting interesting.
 Classic moose shit on the outside, but ...

60
00:06:15.040 --> 00:06:17.840
Blood in the stool.

61
00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:22.840
Fragrance of testosterone, probably damaged or malformed.

62
00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:27.560
You can check.
 Lucas can get its own.

63
00:06:27.720 --> 00:06:31.000
Leif!
 Check.

64
00:06:33.200 --> 00:06:39.040
- What the hell is that?
 -My.
 We say it's bear shit.

65
00:06:40.920 --> 00:06:49.440
Are you nuts?!
 It smells of stools.
 We will not be paid.

66
00:06:51.880 --> 00:06:55.560
Guys, what have you found here?

67
00:06:55.720 --> 00:07:00.400
- It's ... --... Björnskit, actually.

68
00:07:00.560 --> 00:07:05.120
- Is it bear bait?
 - Yes, I just found it.

69
00:07:05.280 --> 00:07:08.920
It is fresh, and hot!

70
00:07:09.080 --> 00:07:12.840
-Yes.
 - Is it a bear in the area?

71
00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:17.480
Do not worry.
 There is no bear here.

72
00:07:17.640 --> 00:07:23.760
- You have to analyze it now.
 - No, that means bad luck.

73
00:07:23.920 --> 00:07:26.920
Damn, Leif.
 We have paid for the course.

74
00:07:27.080 --> 00:07:31.760
We wanted to see bear shit, and so you can't analyze it.

75
00:07:31.920 --> 00:07:34.880
Please?

76
00:07:40.200 --> 00:07:42.920
Thanks.

77
00:07:45.720 --> 00:07:52.400
I can see that it is a disturbed bear.
 Now we have analyzed clearly.

78
00:07:52.560 --> 00:07:59.440
No!
 Crack it, as you did with the others.
 We want to know how it is doing!

79
00:08:01.960 --> 00:08:04.200
Drive.

80
00:08:09.320 --> 00:08:16.160
Yes, we can see that it is a grossly disturbed bear who is feeling damn bad -

81
00:08:16.320 --> 00:08:20.880
- And can't behave among other men ... bears.

82
00:08:21.040 --> 00:08:26.560
It has an incurable chromosome error.
 It is a psychopathic bear.

83
00:08:26.720 --> 00:08:29.960
So, now we have finished analyzing.

84
00:08:30.120 --> 00:08:35.000
Now it's bedtime.
 The course is over!
 We're going up early.

85
00:08:35.160 --> 00:08:38.240
-Cool.
 -Yes.

86
00:08:43.080 --> 00:08:48.680
C.Teletext.urfjarranod afternoon.
 News!
 The tension towards our neighbors in the east is increasing.

87
00:08:48.840 --> 00:08:56.080
C.Tetetext.urfjarrans Russia takes seriously on the Finnish-Swedish renovation.

88
00:08:56.240 --> 00:08:59.600
How far do you think a bullet is flying?

89
00:09:02.800 --> 00:09:06.000
With the right wind, so ...

90
00:09:14.760 --> 00:09:17.600
A sniper!

91
00:09:21.360 --> 00:09:27.400
- No, now it will be the bed.
 - Yes, that's just as good.

92
00:09:27.560 --> 00:09:30.840
Good night, guys.
 Sleep tight.

93
00:09:34.440 --> 00:09:37.320
What the hell?!

94
00:09:37.480 --> 00:09:43.880
- Jonas, this doesn't feel good.
 - No, really not.

95
00:09:44.520 --> 00:09:49.240
C.Tetetext.urfjarran mode between Sweden, Finland and Russia is aggravated.

96
00:09:49.400 --> 00:09:54.040
C.Tetetext.urfjarrans Russia says that Finland has shot a Russian battalion.

97
00:09:54.200 --> 00:09:58.760
-What the hell are you doing?
 - You wanted to take it easy.

98
00:09:58.920 --> 00:10:02.040
You just go on your fucking phone.

99
00:10:02.200 --> 00:10:07.280
That is just propaganda.
 You don't have to be worried.

100
00:10:07.440 --> 00:10:10.640
Now we pack up here.

101
00:10:15.040 --> 00:10:18.240
C.Teletext.kudskylk.kudwalkie-Talkie gets Russian votes

102
00:10:21.720 --> 00:10:24.680
Piss radio!
 We would have bought a new one.

103
00:10:24.840 --> 00:10:29.720
We stand right on the Finnish border.

104
00:10:31.120 --> 00:10:33.400
What the hell.

105
00:10:33.560 --> 00:10:37.560
C.Teletext. sound signc. sound talk pretends

106
00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:40.120
"Go to the forest. Shoot in the skull."

107
00:10:40.280 --> 00:10:46.040
- Imagine if it was a warning!
 - No, it's just shit radio.

108
00:10:46.200 --> 00:10:50.760
- "ne preduprezjdenije ..." –You should not tease ...

109
00:10:50.920 --> 00:10:55.520
Quiet.
 Put the comradion away.
 That's enough.

110
00:10:55.680 --> 00:11:01.480
We go down and camp and start with the sliding exercise.

111
00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:15.520
Damn, Leif.
 Check.

112
00:11:15.680 --> 00:11:19.320
"Russian soldiers across the Finnish border."

113
00:11:19.480 --> 00:11:25.840
- Should we not interrupt?
 –And not get paid?
 No.

114
00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:30.640
Now we clear this course.
 Get the rifle.

115
00:11:39.520 --> 00:11:41.720
What the hell?!

116
00:11:48.560 --> 00:11:52.480
-What the hell?!
 - Damn idiot!

117
00:11:52.640 --> 00:11:57.840
Sorry.
 Sorry, Leif, I dropped it.

118
00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:04.400
Then we move on with the course.
 What is most important in wildlife care and hunting?

119
00:12:04.560 --> 00:12:08.960
- Not fuck I know.
 Security?
 - Did you even know anything about rifles?

120
00:12:09.120 --> 00:12:14.520
- This course is a damn joke.
 - I know how to use a rifle.

121
00:12:14.680 --> 00:12:17.760
I've been chasing here since I was twelve.

122
00:12:17.920 --> 00:12:23.120
- This doesn't feel good.
 We are going home.
 - First, you have to pay.

123
00:12:23.280 --> 00:12:28.760
-No!
 The course is anything but good.
 - You have to pay half.

124
00:12:28.920 --> 00:12:31.240
Ah!

125
00:12:32.560 --> 00:12:35.280
Russians!

126
00:12:38.360 --> 00:12:42.720
- No, what are you doing?!
 - Switch for fucking!

127
00:12:44.680 --> 00:12:48.840
- Fucking fools.
 - Sniper, come on!

128
00:12:51.840 --> 00:12:56.360
Die, Motherfucker.
 Woho!

129
00:12:56.520 --> 00:12:59.400
Slide, Billy!

130
00:13:01.720 --> 00:13:05.040
Woho, yes!
 Spring, Billy.

131
00:13:18.400 --> 00:13:21.000
Fuck.

132
00:13:22.480 --> 00:13:27.480
- Satan, Leif, we will die.
 - They are too many.

133
00:13:27.640 --> 00:13:31.920
Damn!
 Spring, Billy.
 Running!

134
00:13:43.680 --> 00:13:46.600
-Hell!
 - What the hell happens?

135
00:13:46.760 --> 00:13:51.120
—Sfössjävlar.
 - I said so!
 Damn idiots.

136
00:13:51.280 --> 00:13:56.200
- Now we calm down.
 I don't want to die!
 -Quiet.

137
00:13:56.360 --> 00:13:59.200
What the hell are we going to do?

138
00:14:10.040 --> 00:14:13.400
No no!

139
00:14:13.560 --> 00:14:18.720
It wasn't us!
 There were two brothers from Sörbäcken!

140
00:14:22.240 --> 00:14:27.680
Damn, what have we done?
 There was no money either.

141
00:14:35.440 --> 00:14:41.640
- But what the hell, Leif.
 - We should have paid for the course.

142
00:14:41.800 --> 00:14:45.320
Now we leave here, Billy.

143
00:15:01.960 --> 00:15:04.400
