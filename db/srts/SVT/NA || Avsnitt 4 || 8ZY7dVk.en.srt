00:00:04.360 --> 00:00:09.120
In tonight's section of Ifs, immigrants for Swedes:

2
00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:12.080
Greek from Alby, Thanos Fotas.

3
00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:14.960
Sweden's most fun Chinese, Evelyn Mok.

4
00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:18.560
Sweden's second best celebrity dancer, Filip Dikmen.

5
00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:22.880
The Persian songbird from Örebro, Jasmine Kara.

6
00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:26.160
Graaf-Kera Pirate Captain Louie Marti.

7
00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:30.240
Kosovoalbanian telephone fraudster Laura Ukaj.

8
00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:33.480
The Finnish Tiktok Kanyan from Rimbo, Liam Kalevi.

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:37.280
The Roman-Jewish horse dealer Chang Frick.

10
00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:40.280
The world's Swedishest Arab, Elaf Ali.

11
00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:43.920
The Latin King, Douglas "Dogge" León.

12
00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:49.080
Last but not least, our program manager Ahmed Berhan.

13
00:00:54.360 --> 00:01:00.640
Welcome to IFS, where the panelists' social security numbers start at 0101.

14
00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:03.800
I am Ahmed Berhan, your humble program manager.

15
00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:08.160
You look at the quiz about all culture in Sweden.

16
00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:16.600
Keep the applause for the competitors: Lennart, Linnea and Pontus.

17
00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:24.320
The contestant chooses one in the panel that I ask another question.

18
00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:28.200
Then the contestant decides whether they are lying or not.

19
00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:35.040
It is a small advantage to start, and that advantage goes to Linnea.

20
00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:43.160
- Who in our wonderful panel do you choose?
 –Alaf.

21
00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:45.320
–Alaf.
 –Yes.

22
00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:57.960
The government had an honorary guest that they had booked into a luxury hotel.

23
00:01:58.120 --> 00:02:03.160
When she was going to eat hotel breakfast, the staff ran after her -

24
00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:07.800
- And said she was not allowed to eat there, because she was wearing Roma clothes.

25
00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:13.680
–That's What Happened.
 - Lite skeptical, I would say.

26
00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:18.360
-In order to...?
 - It sounds a bit unlikely.

27
00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:25.120
- I say it's false.
 - You say it's false.
 Wrong.

28
00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:28.280
The answer was absolutely true, and it was horrible.

29
00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:32.520
The guest of honor was Diana Nyman from the Roma Council in Gothenburg.

30
00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:36.640
We continue with the next competitor, Pontus.

31
00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:44.760
- What do you want to talk to?
 - I want to talk to Miss Ukaj.

32
00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:48.840
--Wow!
 -Okay okay...

33
00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:52.640
- "All right."
 --Laura.

34
00:02:57.600 --> 00:03:00.600
It is Ahmed as a baby.

35
00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:05.240
That looks like you today, so I don't know what you are talking about.

36
00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:08.280
Ay, papi.

37
00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:13.680
-No.
 Laura?
 –Okay, it's like this ...

38
00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:18.200
All Blatte Parents scare their children -

39
00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:22.400
- With such sick stories that make the children traumatized.

40
00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:27.200
The rest is history, which is why we are singles.

41
00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:33.160
It was a girl who got tired of the mother reading the Qur'an.

42
00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:36.280
She watched TV, certainly something exciting.

43
00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:42.320
She hit the Qur'an and then turned into that.

44
00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:48.680
Is it true or false that it is the story of how that picture came about?

45
00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:54.040
It was a good story, at least.
 But whether it is true or false ...

46
00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:58.600
- It feels ... - brother, you have two options.

47
00:03:58.760 --> 00:04:02.120
It's false.
 I think it's false.

48
00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:07.520
- Unfortunately, it's true.
 --Ay, papi.

49
00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:10.720
The picture spread at the Muslim Forum from 2005–

50
00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:14.040
–And was the most popular in the early 2010s.

51
00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:20.360
Better luck next time.
 - On to the third competition: Lennart.

52
00:04:20.520 --> 00:04:25.680
- Come again, now we're cracking zero.
 - Now we crack zero.
 Yes...

53
00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:30.480
- What do you choose?
 - Jasmine.

54
00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:38.480
I was a little disappointed, because you look like the men who usually choose me.

55
00:04:47.080 --> 00:04:49.200
I am waiting...

56
00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:53.680
Was it just me who felt that Lennart was laughing a little too hard?

57
00:04:53.840 --> 00:04:58.600
- It came from here.
 - Next round.

58
00:04:58.760 --> 00:05:02.160
- Next round, yes.
 - Jasmine.

59
00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:09.080
Laleh played Eva's buddy -

60
00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:15.320
- In "Eva & amp; Adam - four birthdays and one failure", I have for me.

61
00:05:15.480 --> 00:05:22.160
She was an annoying friend, one who mucked a lot.
 Her name was Fatima.

62
00:05:22.320 --> 00:05:27.520
I join the no-sayers and say it's false.

63
00:05:27.680 --> 00:05:30.240
I'm saying fake.

64
00:05:30.400 --> 00:05:35.520
Bram, there is no button.
 No.

65
00:05:35.680 --> 00:05:39.960
Just that, there was no button here.

66
00:05:40.120 --> 00:05:44.400
Lennart, congratulations!
 You have received the first point of the evening.

67
00:05:47.800 --> 00:05:52.880
She played a girl who was picked up from Lebanon for an arranged marriage.

68
00:05:53.040 --> 00:05:56.480
That movie is obviously called "Jalla! Jalla!".

69
00:06:00.360 --> 00:06:04.760
- Linnaeus, are you ready to take a point?
 -Yes.

70
00:06:04.920 --> 00:06:08.520
- What do you choose?
 -Thanos.

71
00:06:08.680 --> 00:06:10.680
Thanos.

72
00:06:12.320 --> 00:06:19.200
That is what happens when a Swedish police chief marries a Turkish.

73
00:06:20.400 --> 00:06:25.600
No, this was a campaign made ten years ago -

74
00:06:25.760 --> 00:06:31.240
-Where you tried to attract a lot of town-kids to become cops.

75
00:06:31.400 --> 00:06:34.080
Okay...

76
00:06:36.960 --> 00:06:40.720
Okay!
 Is that the information I get?

77
00:06:40.880 --> 00:06:44.480
I like the word "Aina".
 I'm kind of happy.

78
00:06:44.640 --> 00:06:47.520
It was the Swedish I heard.

79
00:06:47.680 --> 00:06:52.040
She will be happy with Aina - we are traumatized!

80
00:06:53.040 --> 00:06:56.760
That's why I say it's true.

81
00:06:56.920 --> 00:07:00.880
Congratulations, Linnea!
 You've received your first point.

82
00:07:03.960 --> 00:07:10.040
The Ainabil was standing in the Stockholm Police booth during the UNG08 festival 2006.

83
00:07:10.200 --> 00:07:15.000
Lennart and Linnea have received points.
 Time for you to shine.

84
00:07:15.160 --> 00:07:19.360
- So I'll fail again?
 - What do you choose?

85
00:07:19.520 --> 00:07:22.200
Chang.

86
00:07:34.640 --> 00:07:37.520
"The livestock service".

87
00:07:38.720 --> 00:07:41.680
Well, it has little to do with it.

88
00:07:41.840 --> 00:07:44.840
The Swedish film industry was very released.

89
00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:52.160
You were the first to show breasts, and you had real intercourse on film.

90
00:07:58.800 --> 00:08:04.400
- It was so the fallow sausage was invented.
 - Yes, exactly, that was so.

91
00:08:04.560 --> 00:08:08.360
Only the three Swedes took the joke.

92
00:08:08.520 --> 00:08:13.480
- I didn't take anything.
 "Fun ..." - "What sausage? I don't get."

93
00:08:13.640 --> 00:08:19.160
- Does it feel awkward?
 - I think Chang goes with falsehood.

94
00:08:19.320 --> 00:08:23.480
You don't think Swedish film was released and challenging?

95
00:08:23.640 --> 00:08:28.440
- I choose that it is false.
 - You think Chang is lying?

96
00:08:28.600 --> 00:08:32.560
- Everyone believes.
 - I don't trust him either.

97
00:08:32.720 --> 00:08:38.360
He has a face that you do not trust, but today does not lie Chang.

98
00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:45.080
I don't know if you should applaud, cry or laugh.

99
00:08:45.240 --> 00:08:49.840
In the 50-60s it was artistic but in the 70s pure porn videos-

100
00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:54.560
- With quality rolls such as the island of love and the livestock service.

101
00:08:54.720 --> 00:08:58.400
- Lennart, are you ready to take a point?
 -Obvious.

102
00:08:58.560 --> 00:09:02.560
- What do you want to talk to?
 - I have to take Evelyn, then.

103
00:09:07.840 --> 00:09:09.800
Evelyn.

104
00:09:12.720 --> 00:09:16.560
From Kalle when I went in the third.

105
00:09:16.720 --> 00:09:20.240
And also that I get that question.

106
00:09:21.920 --> 00:09:25.920
Mongo comes from mongoloid ...

107
00:09:26.080 --> 00:09:30.720
... which was a racial biological term.

108
00:09:30.880 --> 00:09:36.760
That was what they called people from Mongolia, p.g.a.
 The folds in the eyes.

109
00:09:36.920 --> 00:09:41.000
Or as I call it, my eyes.

110
00:09:41.160 --> 00:09:46.480
Then they started calling people with Down syndrome for that -

111
00:09:46.640 --> 00:09:49.600
- Because they had similar eyes.

112
00:09:49.760 --> 00:09:55.800
Then it became in popular "mongo", a degrading word.

113
00:09:57.280 --> 00:10:00.080
-Thanks so much.
 -You are welcome.

114
00:10:00.240 --> 00:10:02.280
Yes...

115
00:10:02.440 --> 00:10:09.600
Here the bad conscience emerges.
 I belong to that generation that ...

116
00:10:09.760 --> 00:10:12.680
Worked at the Ras Biology Institute?

117
00:10:14.840 --> 00:10:19.040
- No, but that heard those words.
 - "Heard"?

118
00:10:19.200 --> 00:10:23.400
You got guilt because you heard those words?

119
00:10:24.720 --> 00:10:28.040
Okay then, "said".

120
00:10:28.200 --> 00:10:31.320
Therefore, I am convinced that it is true.

121
00:10:31.480 --> 00:10:37.360
Otherwise, I have humiliated people when I was little unnecessary.

122
00:10:43.040 --> 00:10:46.800
Lennart, you've got one more point.

123
00:10:49.600 --> 00:10:56.360
In old Swedish race biology, "the Mongoloid breed group" was said about East Asians.

124
00:10:56.520 --> 00:10:58.800
Shout-out, Djingis Khan.

125
00:10:58.960 --> 00:11:05.600
- Conduct, I just say.
 - We accept your apology, Lennart.

126
00:11:05.760 --> 00:11:10.160
- Linnaeus, who do you choose?
 - I choose Louie.

127
00:11:10.320 --> 00:11:15.240
-Louie, Louie, Louie!
 - EL Gitano.

128
00:11:22.640 --> 00:11:27.760
I would rather not talk about that, because then they will send us back.

129
00:11:27.920 --> 00:11:30.000
You are a smart man.

130
00:11:30.160 --> 00:11:34.160
It all started with two brothers, who then grew big.

131
00:11:34.320 --> 00:11:38.840
They were not accepted by anyone.

132
00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:43.320
They built their own village which then became a city.

133
00:11:43.480 --> 00:11:46.480
We call that city Rome today.

134
00:11:46.640 --> 00:11:52.000
That is why gypsies, or Roma, call themselves Roma.

135
00:11:52.160 --> 00:11:58.080
But according to researchers, it turns out that we are accompanied from India as well.

136
00:11:58.240 --> 00:12:01.160
In some way I like that story.

137
00:12:01.320 --> 00:12:06.040
- It's pretty nice, huh?
 - Yes, so I say it's true.

138
00:12:06.200 --> 00:12:11.640
- He will be expelled to India.
 –Rom, Bre, Rome.

139
00:12:11.800 --> 00:12:16.000
You think he tells the truth, and he does.

140
00:12:20.720 --> 00:12:23.400
Roma said they originate from Rome-

141
00:12:23.560 --> 00:12:26.600
- But it turned out that they originate from India.

142
00:12:26.760 --> 00:12:32.520
The Romans were the first black shells to lie that they came from Italy.

143
00:12:32.680 --> 00:12:35.680
- Pontus, who in the panel do you choose?
 - Help me, Dogge.

144
00:12:35.840 --> 00:12:39.760
- So, should I help you?
 -Yes.

145
00:12:39.920 --> 00:12:45.680
Dogge, your legend, this feels like something you can answer really well.

146
00:12:49.120 --> 00:12:54.640
/ Finnish mining/ when standing outside Systembolaget and moving in the door.

147
00:12:56.720 --> 00:12:58.760
-No.
 - Casshus sausage.

148
00:12:58.920 --> 00:13:01.960
The Finnish jerk is an effective contraceptive.

149
00:13:02.120 --> 00:13:07.320
When you have / sound with your mouth / sex, you pull it out before you come ...

150
00:13:07.480 --> 00:13:13.400
--... so you get outside.
 - With a trumpet, right?

151
00:13:13.560 --> 00:13:16.440
How do you have sex, dogge?

152
00:13:16.600 --> 00:13:23.080
It is called "the Finnish jerk".
 You have to move out lightning fast.

153
00:13:23.240 --> 00:13:28.360
- You said it was an effective method?
 - Yes, it usually works ...

154
00:13:28.520 --> 00:13:33.720
- Dogge has type five children.
 - I don't use Finnish jerk.

155
00:13:36.360 --> 00:13:42.240
- No, I think it's false.
 - False?
 Heavy you are, Pontus.

156
00:13:42.400 --> 00:13:49.000
Dogge, thank you for telling you the truth.
 - Unfortunately, no point.

157
00:13:53.120 --> 00:13:57.800
Finnish jerk is an old Swedish expression which means interrupted intercourse.

158
00:13:57.960 --> 00:14:01.960
What we today call "pull-out game strong".

159
00:14:02.640 --> 00:14:04.720
There was no point.

160
00:14:04.880 --> 00:14:09.480
Lennart, you have been on a role.
 Who do you choose?

161
00:14:09.640 --> 00:14:14.640
It must be Liam, because you point to yourself.

162
00:14:19.440 --> 00:14:21.840
Here comes a good question.

163
00:14:27.080 --> 00:14:31.840
It means "male lies" - empty talk from men who do not help.

164
00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:36.800
- What was the word?
 –A so that it will help you ...

165
00:14:36.960 --> 00:14:39.120
I just play with.

166
00:14:39.280 --> 00:14:43.840
The guy reads three basic courses Somali on Södertörn.

167
00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:50.720
- The word was "naag nool".
 - Yes, straight off, just.
 Absolutely.

168
00:14:50.880 --> 00:14:54.000
–Liam, thank you for your lie.
 -No!

169
00:15:00.040 --> 00:15:05.000
It actually describes a hard working and enduring woman.

170
00:15:05.160 --> 00:15:09.080
/ Cheer/ does it have to do with Finnish jerk?

171
00:15:13.080 --> 00:15:19.280
- Linnaeus, time for the last question.
 - And there is one left: Filip.

172
00:15:30.640 --> 00:15:35.240
She was one of the few celebrities who openly supported Paolo Roberto -

173
00:15:35.400 --> 00:15:38.320
- After he went there for sex purchases.

174
00:15:38.480 --> 00:15:46.160
He had apparently been her PT when she trained for "caliphate".
 Yes.

175
00:15:46.320 --> 00:15:48.800
- What was her called?
 --Gizem Erdogan.

176
00:15:48.960 --> 00:15:53.320
She was in "Caliphate" and "Thin Blue Line".

177
00:15:55.200 --> 00:15:58.640
I believe in it - that's true.
 Everyone laughs ...

178
00:15:58.800 --> 00:16:06.520
You think Gizem Erdogan put a heart on Paolo Roberto's Instagram?

179
00:16:06.680 --> 00:16:09.640
Obviously it's false.

180
00:16:14.640 --> 00:16:18.680
She commented on a heart and a star on Yasin's Instagram post -

181
00:16:18.840 --> 00:16:23.200
- If he had nothing to do with the kidnapping of Einár.

182
00:16:23.360 --> 00:16:28.360
Although you did not get points now, you and Lennart have gone to the final.

183
00:16:31.600 --> 00:16:37.760
Unfortunately, Pontus, there will be no more competition for you.
 - A big applause!

184
00:16:43.920 --> 00:16:48.000
In the final it is about getting to five points first.

185
00:16:48.160 --> 00:16:54.080
But if you answer wrong, your opponent will receive the point.

186
00:16:54.240 --> 00:17:00.720
Lennart, are you ready to get started?
 Please and choose a panelist.

187
00:17:00.880 --> 00:17:03.560
–Alaf.
 –Yes.

188
00:17:03.720 --> 00:17:06.600
We start the final with a picture question.

189
00:17:06.760 --> 00:17:12.840
In the picture we see an eritreanic word.
 Do you want to test pronounce it?

190
00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:18.240
-ENKOAKO.
 - You said it with confidence.

191
00:17:18.400 --> 00:17:24.960
-Elaf, do you want to test?
 - I think it is pronounced enkoaho.

192
00:17:25.120 --> 00:17:28.440
-What does it mean?
 - You often hear it when it is election year.

193
00:17:28.600 --> 00:17:32.400
-When it is...?
 - The year!

194
00:17:32.560 --> 00:17:35.840
This means party leadership debate.

195
00:17:37.680 --> 00:17:42.800
ENQWAQQUHO ... yes, of course it is.
 You can see that.

196
00:17:42.960 --> 00:17:49.240
You believe in it.
 Me and the other Eritrean giggles for ourselves ...

197
00:17:50.840 --> 00:17:55.720
... for Eritrea has not had a election year since we arrived.

198
00:17:58.960 --> 00:18:04.440
We chose a shuno and we have been riding with him since then.

199
00:18:04.600 --> 00:18:10.280
So, no, that doesn't mean party leadership debate, but eggs.

200
00:18:10.440 --> 00:18:14.280
-Egg?
 - Lennart, unfortunately, no points.

201
00:18:14.440 --> 00:18:17.800
But, Linnea, you got a point.

202
00:18:21.040 --> 00:18:27.360
- Linnaeus, who do you choose to choose?
 - "Who do you choose to choose"?

203
00:18:27.520 --> 00:18:31.840
- What do you choose?
 - I take Dogge.

204
00:18:34.160 --> 00:18:39.240
- Linnaeus chose me.
 - Do you vomit Linnea?

205
00:18:39.400 --> 00:18:45.400
-No.
 I say no, unfortunately.
 - Dogge has six children, not five.

206
00:18:45.560 --> 00:18:50.040
She would be number seven.
 It's not possible.

207
00:18:50.200 --> 00:18:53.160
- Allh, Haram, what is this?
 -Sorry.

208
00:18:56.840 --> 00:19:04.040
Reggae is soft music.
 You chill, smoke a fat, soft and feel good.

209
00:19:04.200 --> 00:19:10.480
Reggaeton is basically a base drink with rum in ...

210
00:19:10.640 --> 00:19:15.440
Rome, banana, a little sea salt.

211
00:19:15.600 --> 00:19:21.640
- It's fat najs.
 -I do not believe that.

212
00:19:21.800 --> 00:19:27.560
Huh?
 Wait, wait - lucky I didn't choose you.

213
00:19:28.960 --> 00:19:34.360
It says a lot that Dogge needs a woman who believes in his lies.

214
00:19:34.520 --> 00:19:37.520
You chose not to believe it?

215
00:19:37.680 --> 00:19:43.360
I think there is something else, some music or some kind of dance.

216
00:19:43.520 --> 00:19:47.520
I think you know more than you say.

217
00:19:48.520 --> 00:19:52.720
- Linnaeus, you're right.
 -Yes!

218
00:19:52.880 --> 00:19:56.080
It is clear that Dogge lied to you.

219
00:19:56.240 --> 00:19:59.560
Reggaeton is also a music style -

220
00:19:59.720 --> 00:20:04.720
- A more modern, harder style, inspired by dancehall and hip hop.

221
00:20:04.880 --> 00:20:08.320
Linnea has apparently hung on La Isla.

222
00:20:11.800 --> 00:20:16.800
- Congratulations to the point.
 - Lennart?
 - Now it will be Chang.

223
00:20:16.960 --> 00:20:21.680
Bosnia, Serbia and the area around it are called the Balkans.

224
00:20:23.960 --> 00:20:28.960
From all the juggies that stand on the balcony and smoke yellow blend-

225
00:20:29.120 --> 00:20:34.840
- And screams at their kids.
 Balkans, balcony - you know, Serbo -Croatian.

226
00:20:35.000 --> 00:20:40.520
No, it actually comes from when the Ottoman Empire existed.

227
00:20:40.680 --> 00:20:45.720
Then there was another, less kingdom in the northwest, called Balkania.

228
00:20:45.880 --> 00:20:50.040
From there, the name has lived on to the Balkans.

229
00:20:52.160 --> 00:20:55.200
- It's false.
 - You think falsely?

230
00:20:55.360 --> 00:20:58.280
- You think Chang is lying?
 - Yes, today.

231
00:20:58.440 --> 00:21:01.240
Congratulations, Lennart - a point!

232
00:21:05.400 --> 00:21:09.720
The name comes from Turkish for "forest -covered mountains".

233
00:21:09.880 --> 00:21:13.840
The forest trailer came by name.

234
00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:17.400
- Linena?
 –Yes.
 I choose Evelyn.

235
00:21:17.560 --> 00:21:19.640
–Evelyn?
 -Yes.

236
00:21:24.200 --> 00:21:29.520
They hug the fruit and kind of make a wax of it.

237
00:21:29.680 --> 00:21:35.200
They use it to grow their hair, because Iranians are hairy.

238
00:21:35.360 --> 00:21:40.080
Every Iranian has your eye exactly, I swear.

239
00:21:40.240 --> 00:21:44.200
- No more Iran parties for her.
 - But you have a point there.

240
00:21:44.360 --> 00:21:48.240
I make laser and wax, so it's quiet.

241
00:21:48.400 --> 00:21:54.720
What are you saying?
 Are Gooje Sabz juice used to make wax, to grow up?

242
00:21:54.880 --> 00:22:00.880
-Why not?
 Yes, I think so.
 - You choose to believe in Evelyn?

243
00:22:01.040 --> 00:22:05.400
- Unfortunately, it cost you a point.
 -Damn!

244
00:22:05.560 --> 00:22:12.760
You eat them with salt, largely.
 It's plum.
 Nam-nam-nam.

245
00:22:12.920 --> 00:22:18.520
Because you answered wrong, Lennart received a point.

246
00:22:22.800 --> 00:22:26.120
Now it is 2–2, so it's tight.

247
00:22:26.280 --> 00:22:31.160
Lennart, should we see if you take the lead?
 Who do you choose?

248
00:22:31.320 --> 00:22:36.120
To take the lead ... Jasmine.

249
00:22:37.720 --> 00:22:40.960
You and I, Lennart.

250
00:22:41.120 --> 00:22:43.160
Jasmine.

251
00:22:47.040 --> 00:22:50.360
To dust is to eat the rub.

252
00:22:50.520 --> 00:22:54.560
For example, Kalle on Stureplan might say:

253
00:22:54.720 --> 00:22:59.320
"I'm going past Sturehof and dust all oysters."

254
00:22:59.480 --> 00:23:05.360
Or maybe naser dust all ghormeh sabzi.

255
00:23:05.520 --> 00:23:10.520
He eats all the tading too, so there is nothing left for the family.

256
00:23:10.680 --> 00:23:15.640
- He eats everything, simply.
 - In our time, "dust" was to hit someone.

257
00:23:15.800 --> 00:23:21.800
-Yes exactly.
 - Lennart just: "Yes, exactly!"

258
00:23:22.800 --> 00:23:29.400
I've heard this, but if that's what you said ...

259
00:23:29.560 --> 00:23:33.280
-True or false?
 - That you dust ...

260
00:23:33.440 --> 00:23:40.000
You sweep the plate, cleanse everything - it should be ... false.

261
00:23:40.160 --> 00:23:45.680
Jasmine has not lied to you at all.
 Damma is hose to eat.

262
00:23:49.960 --> 00:23:57.240
You did not take the lead, but let Linnea dust a point from you.

263
00:23:57.400 --> 00:23:59.680
- Linnaeus.
 –Yes.

264
00:23:59.840 --> 00:24:04.000
I was going to take someone who looked a little tired out -

265
00:24:04.160 --> 00:24:08.160
- But many looked tired.
 I choose Liam.

266
00:24:08.320 --> 00:24:13.720
- Why this attack on the panelists?
 - I was just going to live them up a bit.

267
00:24:13.880 --> 00:24:19.960
The first time it was "well", and now I look a little tired.
 Najs.

268
00:24:24.000 --> 00:24:28.200
Money.
 It is swindled to have ten kids.

269
00:24:28.360 --> 00:24:33.280
No, there are perfumed pieces of wood that you light fire on.

270
00:24:33.440 --> 00:24:40.240
There will be incense that protects against evil spirits, such as the social and Kronofogden.

271
00:24:47.840 --> 00:24:52.560
- Where can you buy it?
 –Dm: a later.

272
00:24:52.720 --> 00:24:56.880
- What did you say it was called?
 - Bakhoor.
 - Sorry, say that you.

273
00:24:57.040 --> 00:24:59.320
Bakhoor.

274
00:24:59.480 --> 00:25:04.000
- I think it's true.
 - It is clear that it is true.

275
00:25:10.720 --> 00:25:15.960
Now you got a point, and you already have 4 points.

276
00:25:16.120 --> 00:25:23.040
Lennart, if you answer wrong now, then you have given the whole profit to Linnea.

277
00:25:23.200 --> 00:25:29.680
- Given, huh?
 - Given the entire win for Linnea.

278
00:25:29.840 --> 00:25:36.520
- Don't let me dust on TV.
 - Now I take Thanos.

279
00:25:43.640 --> 00:25:47.960
-Traditionally?
 - He buys the adidas overall first.

280
00:25:48.120 --> 00:25:52.160
–And stomach bag.
 - It's how he comes here.

281
00:25:52.320 --> 00:25:59.440
He contacts the bride's father or brother and has to negotiate with them.

282
00:25:59.600 --> 00:26:04.920
He must pay compensation because they lose labor on the farm -

283
00:26:05.080 --> 00:26:08.800
- When he marries his daughter.

284
00:26:08.960 --> 00:26:14.160
It may be that he pays a thousand bucks as a symbolic sum.

285
00:26:14.320 --> 00:26:17.320
Would the workforce be the daughter?

286
00:26:17.480 --> 00:26:23.160
- Yes, because she also works in the yard.
 - I actually think it's true.

287
00:26:23.320 --> 00:26:28.640
The game is still running.
 You've got one more point.

288
00:26:31.040 --> 00:26:35.040
It is a custom called bridal prize in Swedish.

289
00:26:35.200 --> 00:26:39.320
There have been a number of cultures around the world.

290
00:26:39.480 --> 00:26:44.880
Linna, now it's your turn.
 You can take home the whole thing now.

291
00:26:45.040 --> 00:26:47.480
--Laura.
 -Finally!

292
00:26:47.640 --> 00:26:53.160
- Help me to win!
 - Power puff ping pongs are here.

293
00:26:53.320 --> 00:26:57.480
In the summer of 2021, people from the place of street race on Strandvägen drove.

294
00:26:57.640 --> 00:27:01.640
The Östermalmers did not appreciate it.
 How did the police stop it?

295
00:27:01.800 --> 00:27:05.520
They wanted to party, as every blatte does.

296
00:27:05.680 --> 00:27:10.200
They wanted to park, eat danger, drink Red Bull and be cool.

297
00:27:10.360 --> 00:27:15.560
They didn't get it.
 What happened?
 Well, the cops turned off the street.

298
00:27:15.720 --> 00:27:20.360
Have you control where your tax money went in the summer of 2021?

299
00:27:20.520 --> 00:27:27.200
In the summer of 2021, it was Corona.
 So I think it's false.

300
00:27:27.360 --> 00:27:32.280
You think it's false?
 You just lost a point.

301
00:27:32.440 --> 00:27:36.560
-No!
 –I'm not a liar.

302
00:27:36.720 --> 00:27:42.080
It's true.
 As Linnea answered wrong, it says 4–4.

303
00:27:46.040 --> 00:27:51.440
You have given us an exciting final.
 Is it time to end this?

304
00:27:51.600 --> 00:27:55.840
Remember - if you answer wrong, Linnea gets the point.

305
00:27:56.000 --> 00:27:59.920
It's just ... - Louie.

306
00:28:04.800 --> 00:28:09.640
Good, Lennart.
 Trust me - I'm gypsy.

307
00:28:13.320 --> 00:28:17.960
It is a kind of draft cake from the Middle East.

308
00:28:18.120 --> 00:28:22.200
May contain pistachios or other nuts.

309
00:28:22.360 --> 00:28:28.000
I think the memory everyone has is that you get so sticky about your hands.

310
00:28:28.160 --> 00:28:34.120
You have to have a strong detergent or degreasing to remove the dress.

311
00:28:34.280 --> 00:28:38.720
But incredibly good, incredibly sweet.
 I love it.

312
00:28:40.440 --> 00:28:44.920
I have two words in my head.
 In this case, it is "balaklava".

313
00:28:45.080 --> 00:28:50.480
Baklava, balaklava, baklava ... Fan.
 It's good, delicious, one of them.

314
00:28:50.640 --> 00:28:55.000
It seems to us that we like it.

315
00:28:55.160 --> 00:28:58.360
Fy, this is hard, this I can.

316
00:28:58.520 --> 00:29:01.440
Many backlaws at Lennart.

317
00:29:01.600 --> 00:29:05.760
That's any instrument too, huh?
 Balaklava ...

318
00:29:05.920 --> 00:29:10.000
No, just that, balalas.
 It's true.

319
00:29:10.160 --> 00:29:15.480
- You think Louie tells the truth?
 - It shines the truth about him.

320
00:29:15.640 --> 00:29:21.600
-Are you sure about that?
 - Lennart, you had it, you said it.

321
00:29:21.760 --> 00:29:27.640
Baklava is the sweet, balaklava is what Louie uses when he makes withdrawals.

322
00:29:27.800 --> 00:29:30.880
When I pledge can I have it with me.

323
00:29:31.040 --> 00:29:35.080
- Yeah, balaklava, yes!
 Damn.
 - Exact, it's a robbery hat.
