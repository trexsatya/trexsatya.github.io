1
00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:57.280
Joseph, we must seek protection for the night.

2
00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:03.080
Oh Maria, every inn in Bethlehem is full.

3
00:01:03.240 --> 00:01:11.040
- The child is on the way.
 What should I do?
 - Stick and lie down in the stable.

4
00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:18.840
- So it doesn't stand!
 Read what stands!
 - Read.
 This is very exciting.

5
00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:25.120
- Now comes the three smart guys.
 -The three wise men.

6
00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:31.400
- What do they play?
 - Gymn teacher, the curator and the carpet.

7
00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:39.120
You get great like Mary.
 With your hair and smile you probably get the role.

8
00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:44.520
Just not Jesus is afraid of the dental position.

9
00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:48.560
You're just jealous.

10
00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:54.840
I'm terrified!
 She will be embarrassed.

11
00:01:55.000 --> 00:02:02.800
- Sara, twenty are looking for the role.
 - Just one from an actor family!

12
00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:09.440
Look here.
 It is your own meat and theater blood.

13
00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:18.240
Your father with some of the country's foremost actors.
 I was at the Dramaten!

14
00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:23.680
- He sold sausages during the break.
 - I was an actor!

15
00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:30.160
- You jumped in like Jarl Kulle's horse.
 - It went great.

16
00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:36.320
- Set to the stage at the inn.
 - No one saw.

17
00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:41.680
- Jarl hill saw!
 - He is a bit conventional.

18
00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:49.560
He was not prepared for the horse to settle down and order beer.

19
00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:56.000
-What have I said?
 - "A good actor is the role."

20
00:02:56.160 --> 00:03:02.920
We have the ability to shape the thoughts and dreams of people.

21
00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:08.920
- I will play Maria, not you.
 -Obvious...

22
00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:16.680
I dreamed that you were on stage in front of a cheering audience.
 I cried.

23
00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:24.440
- Because you were not on stage?
 - Because I was proud of Lina!

24
00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:31.440
- Did you have a doll that could be Jesus?
 - Yes, in the wind.

25
00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:37.440
- GRODAN BALL?
 - No one knows what the Jesus child looked like.

26
00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:41.720
I don't think he was green.

27
00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:49.560
Christmas is important!
 We can show how much we love each other.

28
00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:55.400
How much should I love you to get a snowboard?

29
00:03:55.560 --> 00:04:02.480
- Did you know why we celebrate Christmas?
 - GRODAN BALL was born.

30
00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:10.160
- Come, dad, we're late.
 - It's someone else who controls our lives!

31
00:04:10.320 --> 00:04:13.800
Kalle Stropp?

32
00:04:19.520 --> 00:04:27.360
- How do you think it goes for Lina?
 - I worry about is Gustav.

33
00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:35.360
- He has given Lina theater lessons.
 - Imagine that he was an actor ...

34
00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:43.360
He sold sausages and tore tickets.
 He always tries to enlarge it.

35
00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:50.360
I bought that blouse for Lina.
 What does Max want?

36
00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:54.360
A snowboard!

37
00:04:54.520 --> 00:05:02.840
- What have we said about the listening?
 - That you should not be discovered.

38
00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:11.440
-There is a snowboard in the wind.
 -I knew it!
 I get one!
 YES!

39
00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:17.360
- Iidiot!
 - Think about what you say.
 He is ten years old.

40
00:05:18.520 --> 00:05:26.320
You would have your own family that you could decorate and bake gingerbread with.

41
00:05:26.480 --> 00:05:30.720
Yes, where are they somewhere?

42
00:05:30.880 --> 00:05:36.000
At Christmas you should be with your loved ones.

43
00:05:36.160 --> 00:05:43.720
Gustav eats Christmas lunch with the corporate ... - Hello, old man.
 Did you get the role?

44
00:05:43.880 --> 00:05:49.520
-What's that?
 - You will see that - Jesus child!

45
00:05:49.680 --> 00:05:57.320
- She got stuck in the frog threads.
 - Jessica gets the role.
 I know that.

46
00:05:57.480 --> 00:06:03.560
-Why?
 - She is dark and goes to our theater.

47
00:06:03.720 --> 00:06:12.520
I talked to a man in the salon.
 He thought you were great!

48
00:06:12.680 --> 00:06:21.040
White beard, big nose?
 Fill - Ragnar usually sits there and warm up.

49
00:06:21.200 --> 00:06:29.440
- When she knows if she is taken out?
 -Tomorrow.
 The courier makes a report.

50
00:06:29.600 --> 00:06:37.600
The new culture manager says that the children's theater must be revitalized.

51
00:06:37.760 --> 00:06:45.600
-Have you talked to him?
 - I bumped into him on the way out.

52
00:06:45.760 --> 00:06:52.200
He seems nice.
 Now I'm going down town a turn.

53
00:06:52.360 --> 00:06:58.600
-Where are you going?
 - You have some Christmas cases ...

54
00:06:58.760 --> 00:07:06.480
- Can't I go with you then?
 - You don't want to know what you get!

55
00:07:06.640 --> 00:07:11.880
I get the same thing as last year.
 Nothing.

56
00:07:16.040 --> 00:07:21.880
- What should we give a line?
 - She wants a horse ...

57
00:07:22.040 --> 00:07:28.880
She can't spend her puberty with an Ardennes!

58
00:07:29.040 --> 00:07:36.040
If she wants to do horse jumping, we must support her.

59
00:07:36.200 --> 00:07:43.840
I always support the kids.
 How many times have I pushed her there?

60
00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:49.800
-Two.
 - But my enthusiasm is boundless!

61
00:07:49.960 --> 00:07:54.920
I encourage her theater interest.

62
00:07:55.080 --> 00:07:59.240
She has nothing!

63
00:07:59.400 --> 00:08:04.920
-Where's the newspaper?
 - You are a postman!

64
00:08:05.080 --> 00:08:12.400
The days when I'm free I want it to come punctual!

65
00:08:12.560 --> 00:08:17.440
- The magazine has not arrived.
 - It went to the forest.

66
00:08:17.600 --> 00:08:22.080
Never give up.
 Think of Björn Borg!

67
00:08:22.240 --> 00:08:29.640
Pettersson is delays.
 He is a shame for the post office!

68
00:08:29.800 --> 00:08:36.920
- He got diploma for punctuality.
 -He got what he deserved!

69
00:08:37.080 --> 00:08:42.800
Who wants to eat a fool with old postal managers?

70
00:08:42.960 --> 00:08:50.640
It is better than standing and screaming "Rights Knights should win".

71
00:08:50.800 --> 00:08:55.640
I was a little jealous.
 Extremely little.

72
00:08:55.800 --> 00:09:02.880
I think you can expect better judgment from managers ...

73
00:09:03.040 --> 00:09:09.800
- Here it says which ones are selected.
 -How interesting...

74
00:09:09.960 --> 00:09:17.600
- "Maria is played by Jessica Lindén."
 - It gets better down.

75
00:09:17.760 --> 00:09:24.600
"When the gates were closed, the director had not found Herod."

76
00:09:24.760 --> 00:09:31.480
"Then the fire door was torn up and a man stormed in."

77
00:09:31.640 --> 00:09:37.000
"In sounding Hebrew, Gustav Svensson delivered Herod's final replica" -

78
00:09:37.160 --> 00:09:40.280
- "And became the play's last puzzle piece."

79
00:09:40.440 --> 00:09:47.240
What phase is this?!
 Have you planned it from the beginning?

80
00:09:47.400 --> 00:09:51.640
What do you think about me?!

81
00:09:51.800 --> 00:09:56.440
It was pure luck.
 I stood drinking coffee.

82
00:09:56.600 --> 00:10:01.560
It says you talked in Hebrew!

83
00:10:01.720 --> 00:10:09.120
- I don't know where it came from.
 - From these maybe.

84
00:10:09.280 --> 00:10:17.120
To interpret Herod, Herod in Old Hebrew, the Herod of our time ...

85
00:10:17.280 --> 00:10:21.120
White flag!
 Capitulation!

86
00:10:21.280 --> 00:10:29.080
I wanted to maximize the family's chances of getting back to the limelight!

87
00:10:29.240 --> 00:10:33.960
100 percent greater chance of success.

88
00:10:34.120 --> 00:10:38.680
What is it?
 Are you crying?

89
00:10:38.840 --> 00:10:42.920
Yes, because I don't have to join.

90
00:10:43.080 --> 00:10:51.600
Are you ashamed to stand on stage with me?
 It was very fun to hear.

91
00:10:51.760 --> 00:10:58.640
When I was young, all amateur theaters wanted me!

92
00:10:58.800 --> 00:11:06.400
- Did they buy someone who sold sausages?
 - It's an Advent game for children.

93
00:11:06.560 --> 00:11:13.960
Is it so terribly dangerous?

94
00:11:14.120 --> 00:11:18.480
- Yes, dangerous.
 - Thanks for encouragement.

95
00:11:18.640 --> 00:11:26.400
I want to show the children what it was like when Jesus was born.
 Ikhman Hanuva.

96
00:11:26.560 --> 00:11:34.000
- "Let the kids come to me."
 - Her god, poor child!

97
00:11:38.800 --> 00:11:42.040
Respond!

98
00:11:42.200 --> 00:11:47.600
Is there anyone who can answer?
 Oh my God!

99
00:11:55.760 --> 00:12:01.600
Svensson.
 Sara, it loosens all the time.

100
00:12:01.760 --> 00:12:06.520
You have to get over now.
 Thanks.

101
00:12:13.080 --> 00:12:15.720
Huh ...

102
00:12:15.880 --> 00:12:22.320
Every newborn boy in the land of Israel must be ... killed.

103
00:12:22.480 --> 00:12:28.400
With different tones: I am ... yes ... I ... yes ...

104
00:12:30.320 --> 00:12:35.560
It's me, King Herod ...

105
00:12:35.720 --> 00:12:42.680
- Can you interrogate me at the text?
 -No I do not have the energy.

106
00:12:42.840 --> 00:12:49.080
- I help you with the math homework.
 - You can never anything ...

107
00:12:49.240 --> 00:12:52.400
I try anyway!

108
00:12:52.560 --> 00:12:58.080
Read.
 Otherwise, I make sure you get to play the Jesus child.

109
00:12:58.240 --> 00:13:05.160
- Take where Herod comes into the stable.
 - He never entered the stable!

110
00:13:05.320 --> 00:13:12.360
In my version everyone is in the stable.
 Read now, Antichrist!

111
00:13:12.520 --> 00:13:20.280
- What do you want here, noble king?
 - Max, I haven't come in yet.

112
00:13:30.400 --> 00:13:35.440
- Max ... - what do you want here, noble king?

113
00:13:35.600 --> 00:13:41.840
Is there ... Is there any newborn boy child?

114
00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:47.800
No, here is only me and my wife.

115
00:13:47.960 --> 00:13:55.080
What kind of children's crime is my ear belonging to the crib there?

116
00:13:55.240 --> 00:14:00.800
Big king, it's just my old donkey.

117
00:14:00.960 --> 00:14:07.520
-I understand.
 Farewell, carpenter.
 - Is he going on that?

118
00:14:07.680 --> 00:14:14.520
No.
 But I'm king.
 I can come back the next day.

119
00:14:14.680 --> 00:14:21.240
- I should attach the beard.
 - With staple gun?

120
00:14:21.400 --> 00:14:27.680
-Can I go now?
 - Yes, but remove the dishwasher.

121
00:14:27.840 --> 00:14:34.680
- Do you think this will hold?
 -Certainly.
 Are you nervous?

122
00:14:34.840 --> 00:14:42.600
- The wise men should stay away.
 - Yes, the carpet was a boot.

123
00:14:42.760 --> 00:14:49.600
- She stood in the way.
 - Is it just two wise men now?

124
00:14:49.760 --> 00:14:54.200
I may need some turning space.

125
00:14:54.360 --> 00:14:58.200
Interrogate me on the text.

126
00:14:58.360 --> 00:15:03.600
We start where Herod leaves the stable.
 Fa...

127
00:15:03.760 --> 00:15:11.600
Farewell, carpenter.
 Don't forget that Herod is the King of the Jews.

128
00:15:11.760 --> 00:15:20.320
More powerful than the sea, cruel than desert - the sun, wilder than Babylon's barbarian ...

129
00:15:20.480 --> 00:15:24.440
Hello Darling.

130
00:15:24.600 --> 00:15:31.360
Gustav is incredible.
 - You should have become an actor.

131
00:15:31.520 --> 00:15:38.240
She exaggerates.
 I have some details to file on.

132
00:15:38.400 --> 00:15:44.320
The photo dealer asked me to bring these.
 What is it?

133
00:15:44.480 --> 00:15:50.720
-Christmas card.
 - Are our friends interested in this?

134
00:15:50.880 --> 00:15:58.560
- It's Herod.
 He belongs to Christmas.
 - You are in loose beards and cardboard crown!

135
00:15:58.720 --> 00:16:02.960
You have to have some imagination.

136
00:16:03.120 --> 00:16:09.560
You never become a great actor.
 It's a Christmas game for children!

137
00:16:09.720 --> 00:16:16.880
Many large theater profiles started as a child actors.

138
00:16:17.040 --> 00:16:23.480
- They were children when they started!
 - I know well!

139
00:16:23.640 --> 00:16:30.000
I'm not saying I'm going to become an actor -

140
00:16:30.160 --> 00:16:36.600
- But if things go well, you must stand open.

141
00:16:36.760 --> 00:16:41.720
- This has risen to your head.
 -Not at all.

142
00:16:41.880 --> 00:16:44.920
What is this, then?

143
00:16:55.520 --> 00:16:59.840
We are well for the fuck a family!

144
00:17:22.160 --> 00:17:29.000
- Is anyone seeing Dad?
 - Bakom the curtain.

145
00:17:29.160 --> 00:17:36.000
- Gustav, here we are!
 -Silent!
 Someone can believe we know him!

146
00:17:36.160 --> 00:17:43.400
- It's hardly someone you recognize.
 - It's mostly school children.

147
00:17:43.560 --> 00:17:51.080
- In premiere there should be celebrities.
 - It is - there are filled -ragnar.

148
00:17:51.240 --> 00:17:59.000
I hope all is going well.
 Gustav gets devastated if not everything is true.

149
00:17:59.160 --> 00:18:06.520
- He has few replicas.
 What can go wrong?
 - Sure most of it ...

150
00:18:06.680 --> 00:18:12.400
The courier's new cultural director was theater reviewer before -

151
00:18:12.560 --> 00:18:15.920
- But he was too hard.

152
00:18:16.080 --> 00:18:22.480
He called the death dance "an easy trifle".

153
00:18:22.640 --> 00:18:29.280
- He talks to Jessica's dad.
 - Brown in her.

154
00:18:29.440 --> 00:18:34.120
She will get a horse in Christmas present ...

155
00:18:34.280 --> 00:18:41.920
- Dad is the head of Ekberga Invest!
 - Our father is the King of the Jews!

156
00:18:42.080 --> 00:18:50.080
- Have Gustav participated in television programs?
 - He was an audience in Café Norrköping.

157
00:18:51.440 --> 00:18:55.960
Look!
 I got my ad!

158
00:18:56.120 --> 00:19:02.000
"Do you like Herod's beard? Get the same at Salong Virlvel."

159
00:19:02.160 --> 00:19:08.160
Certainly many children who want full beard ...

160
00:19:08.320 --> 00:19:12.840
I check for the emergency exits.

161
00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:20.000
Why would it go to the forest just because Gustav never succeeded before?

162
00:19:20.160 --> 00:19:26.640
-Quiet.
 - You will be in disaster situations!

163
00:19:33.600 --> 00:19:39.120
In Zion's land, a star shone over Bethlehem ...

164
00:19:39.280 --> 00:19:42.120
Snark!

165
00:19:50.920 --> 00:19:56.640
- then?
 Arvidsjaur?
 - It's too close!

166
00:19:56.800 --> 00:20:05.080
After all, they went out.
 It was not Gustav's fault that some la straw in the crib

167
00:20:05.240 --> 00:20:11.880
- But Dad threw a torch into it.
 - He dropped it.

168
00:20:15.240 --> 00:20:22.440
-Why are you so happy?
 - It's actually a shame about Jessica!

169
00:20:22.600 --> 00:20:30.200
- She had prepared the role for weeks.
 - But she was not prepared for Herod.

170
00:20:30.360 --> 00:20:38.160
We can send flowers and invite them and talk about it in peace and quiet.

171
00:20:38.320 --> 00:20:46.160
- Dad get to explain how it started!
 - He got stuck with the sandal in the crib.

172
00:20:46.320 --> 00:20:52.240
- Then he dropped the torch in the straw.
 -Stop.
 The children looked terrified.

173
00:20:52.400 --> 00:20:57.520
Dad stood there and milled trying to extinguish the fire.

174
00:20:57.680 --> 00:21:00.560
Imagine if they hadn't been out on time!

175
00:21:00.720 --> 00:21:08.240
- Good morning ... or "yach mammenam".
 - Don't you think it's enough now?!

176
00:21:08.400 --> 00:21:13.240
Read.
 Read, I say.

177
00:21:15.400 --> 00:21:20.120
"The Herod's Herod is here."

178
00:21:20.280 --> 00:21:25.840
"The Advent game becomes a big theater."

179
00:21:26.000 --> 00:21:30.680
“Svensson's interpretation of Herod is uncompromising.

180
00:21:30.840 --> 00:21:33.680
"Especially strong is he" -

181
00:21:33.840 --> 00:21:40.040
- "When he sticks the crib on fire and calls for Satan."

182
00:21:42.720 --> 00:21:46.400
There you see.
 I made a success!

183
00:21:46.560 --> 00:21:51.440
This reviewer is an idiot!

184
00:21:51.200 --> 00:21:54.440
C.Teletext.kudskylk.kuddörrklockan

185
00:21:51.600 --> 00:21:56.560
- It's to me.
 - You stay here!

186
00:21:57.800 --> 00:22:05.440
I showed the children genuine feelings, that there is a world of flesh and blood.

187
00:22:05.600 --> 00:22:12.440
- They did not have a golden gold.
 - They didn't let go of smoke damage!

188
00:22:12.600 --> 00:22:18.280
Dad, there are some who want to talk to you.

189
00:22:18.440 --> 00:22:25.280
Hello.
 My name is Monika Rydell.
 I am a school curator.

190
00:22:25.440 --> 00:22:32.840
You have to accompany the low school.
 It is complete chaos.

191
00:22:33.000 --> 00:22:40.920
- No students dare to enter.
 - The kids scream that Herod is there.

192
00:22:41.080 --> 00:22:46.320
We have tried to calm them down all morning.

193
00:22:46.480 --> 00:22:53.040
Follow and show that you are not herods and do not intend to kill them.

194
00:22:55.240 --> 00:23:02.120
There will be no more performances.
 - We're talking about it tonight.

195
00:23:02.280 --> 00:23:10.040
Tonight, you should fire the hall.
 It looks too damn good.
 Come along.

196
00:23:10.200 --> 00:23:15.440
- Father, the King of the Jews.
 –Ach Laminan!

197
00:23:17.000 --> 00:23:23.440
-What does it mean?
 - "You can always sell sausages during the break."

198
00:24:02.600 --> 00:24:04.600
