1
00:00:54.120 --> 00:01:00.320
We will listen to a nice melody from 1944.

2
00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:08.360
Who sings?
 Enter the first name, four letters, in vertical two.

3
00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:17.920
- But what nice!
 - Sssch!
 Ulla Billquist!

4
00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:26.520
- Have you already set breakfast?
 - Is something better than Saturday mornings?

5
00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:33.560
The melody cruise, peace and quiet and not a child in sight.

6
00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:41.680
- Gustav, tonight ... - fix!
 I have grinded the skates.

7
00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:48.480
Can't we go tomorrow?
 We will be visited tonight.
 Mom and dad.

8
00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:54.360
They are going to Åke and Margit and need to sleep over.

9
00:01:54.520 --> 00:02:02.920
You know what it is about.
 You know exactly!
 See you on Monday.

10
00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:08.160
Does it carry off now?
 Thanks for these years!

11
00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:16.040
- Dad has to travel away for a while.
 - Grandma and Grandpa come tonight.

12
00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:24.240
- No, then it will start again.
 - It's best that I go.

13
00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:28.320
Why do you get nervous when they come?

14
00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:33.600
I?
 It is you who gets nervous!

15
00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:40.600
- Because my own parents come?
 –Justus Adam - Yes!

16
00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:45.240
You are ashamed because I'm a postman.

17
00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:52.040
Your father wanted you to marry a lawyer.

18
00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:59.840
You know he likes you.
 Otherwise, he would not have invited you to hunt.

19
00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:07.360
He bore like an insane!
 He threw himself over me!

20
00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:13.640
That was fortunate.
 You were aiming for fucking a horse!

21
00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:18.440
He and I do not fit together.

22
00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:25.440
My parents would never come without asking for permission!

23
00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:33.800
Your parents would never tie your shoes without asking for permission first.

24
00:03:33.960 --> 00:03:42.200
Why do you insist on taking them here when you have released them?

25
00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:48.400
The first time we were going out together, you said, right in the face of Einar:

26
00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:54.680
"This is Gustav, the man I love."

27
00:03:54.840 --> 00:04:03.240
I said: "This is Gustav, we should go to the cinema, I might come home late".

28
00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:08.520
Don't notice words!
 I felt what you meant.

29
00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:16.280
- Everything goes well, only you are yourself.
 - Not as the last time they were here.

30
00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:21.960
- What did you say then?
 - I mentioned something about a promotion.

31
00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:28.280
- You would become regional manager.
 -That is all!

32
00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:34.040
- Don't gloss the BMW.
 -Can you be quiet?

33
00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:41.720
Okay, maybe I said something about a car that I would be forced to go around in.

34
00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:49.400
He wants to hear how much you earn, how expensive hunting equipment you have ...

35
00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:55.200
I have never asked you to lie for my sake.

36
00:04:55.360 --> 00:05:00.840
As you wish.
 They may take me as I am!

37
00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:06.120
Good.
 If you clean up, I go and buy meat.

38
00:05:06.280 --> 00:05:10.880
Einar has probably shot something on the road ...

39
00:05:15.040 --> 00:05:19.880
This is also yours.
 Lend a hand!

40
00:05:20.040 --> 00:05:27.520
- I do not fuck for uninvited guests.
 - not before they came here ...

41
00:05:27.680 --> 00:05:33.520
Björn Borg had different tactics for different opponents.

42
00:05:33.680 --> 00:05:40.520
What then - sometimes he hit the right, sometimes to the left?

43
00:05:40.680 --> 00:05:46.520
- Max, you haven't dusted up here.
 - I don't reach.

44
00:05:46.680 --> 00:05:52.520
- Stand on the chair!
 -It's dangerous.
 I'm only ten years old.

45
00:05:52.680 --> 00:05:58.800
Older you will not be if you do not help your sister.

46
00:05:58.960 --> 00:06:02.640
Help me put this up.

47
00:06:02.800 --> 00:06:08.120
Nice to see you so relaxed.

48
00:06:08.280 --> 00:06:12.520
It's our wedding present!

49
00:06:12.680 --> 00:06:18.840
- It usually stands behind the boiler.
 - Serve it, and I'll stop you later.

50
00:06:20.440 --> 00:06:25.280
-Are you done soon?
 - Just seven pages left.

51
00:06:25.440 --> 00:06:30.560
Remove this debris.
 They are coming soon.

52
00:06:30.720 --> 00:06:36.560
-Lumber?
 These are my sports items.
 - Speed up now!

53
00:06:38.720 --> 00:06:43.880
They should only be here for 24 hours.

54
00:06:44.040 --> 00:06:51.480
I lie down at seven, sleep until nine, throw out on the town ...

55
00:06:51.640 --> 00:06:59.240
Shower and throw on you some of the shaving water you got from a grandmother last Christmas.

56
00:06:59.400 --> 00:07:06.040
- You seem nervous.
 - You haven't smoked for three years.

57
00:07:06.200 --> 00:07:10.840
I know that well.
 But I'm starting now.

58
00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:15.640
-Hello Sara!
 - Have they come?

59
00:07:15.800 --> 00:07:22.640
- Have you started smoking?
 - No, it was Max who wanted to try.

60
00:07:25.800 --> 00:07:33.600
Gustav says that what he doesn't get away is death and your parents ...

61
00:07:34.600 --> 00:07:38.560
I love them.
 They are very nice.

62
00:07:39.720 --> 00:07:43.920
–What do they have for a car?
 –A Audi.

63
00:07:44.080 --> 00:07:51.880
"Born free, estimated to death."
 It says the manager on the registration plate.

64
00:07:55.560 --> 00:08:03.720
Lillan!
 But how pale you are.
 Sweetie!
 Long time no see.

65
00:08:03.880 --> 00:08:08.000
Here is Sara that I have told about.

66
00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:14.200
My little chickens, what you are big!

67
00:08:14.360 --> 00:08:20.360
- You don't want sweets, huh?
 - Why do you think we stay?

68
00:08:20.520 --> 00:08:28.320
- Can you hug the bank director?
 - Office manager ... but hugging, you.

69
00:08:30.480 --> 00:08:37.000
- Sara, my neighbor.
 -How nice.
 Hi, Sara.

70
00:08:37.160 --> 00:08:42.440
Are you really killing all rabbits?

71
00:08:42.600 --> 00:08:46.120
No, but hares I have shot.

72
00:08:46.280 --> 00:08:53.760
Gustav says he never escapes two things: death and ...

73
00:08:53.920 --> 00:09:00.600
- Oh, what you got in a hurry now, Sara!
 - Yes, yes ... sure.

74
00:09:02.120 --> 00:09:08.960
- Do you have it left up there?
 - It's done, Dad.

75
00:09:09.120 --> 00:09:15.600
- Did you know where that species belong?
 - Yes, behind the boiler.

76
00:09:18.600 --> 00:09:24.000
Einar and Dagmar, fun to see you!

77
00:09:24.160 --> 00:09:28.400
-Hello!
 -Bye.

78
00:09:28.560 --> 00:09:32.080
Where are you going?

79
00:09:32.240 --> 00:09:38.080
Chaos on sorting - right today!

80
00:09:38.240 --> 00:09:44.520
-It is Saturday.
 - But the duty calls.

81
00:09:44.680 --> 00:09:48.600
If you go, I'll kill you.

82
00:09:48.760 --> 00:09:54.480
- It resolved with the sorting.
 -How fun.

83
00:09:54.640 --> 00:09:58.640
Mom, it's time for house vision.

84
00:09:58.800 --> 00:10:06.320
I want you to see how nice your painting fits in Lina's room.

85
00:10:06.480 --> 00:10:10.360
You hung up the king and Silvia?

86
00:10:10.520 --> 00:10:14.680
Yes, but it is an oil stain on Silvia.

87
00:10:14.840 --> 00:10:21.040
- They don't see it.
 -It looks like a Hitler mustache.

88
00:10:21.200 --> 00:10:25.240
Mom, go to the bathroom instead!

89
00:10:30.120 --> 00:10:35.840
- Take more fruit compote.
 -Thank you for the food.

90
00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:43.600
- What do we do with the plates?
 - Gate them to you so you can wash.

91
00:10:43.760 --> 00:10:51.240
- Sensors that you do not meet them more often.
 - We have to send pictures.

92
00:10:51.400 --> 00:10:58.160
It's not enough.
 Dad and I have talked a lot.

93
00:10:58.320 --> 00:11:05.760
Sorry we didn't come up, but Lina had any show.

94
00:11:05.920 --> 00:11:11.760
-Which?
 - Ni does so much in your age ...

95
00:11:11.920 --> 00:11:18.400
- Nattery, thief smoking, petting ... - Yes, see little guys!

96
00:11:19.560 --> 00:11:26.000
Yes ... now it's time, Dagmar.
 It contracts.

97
00:11:26.160 --> 00:11:34.160
- Maybe I should help with the bags?
 - So easy you don't get rid of us.

98
00:11:34.320 --> 00:11:37.600
I want to say a few words.

99
00:11:37.760 --> 00:11:43.360
Mom and I are so grateful that you receive us.

100
00:11:43.520 --> 00:11:48.800
- We feel warmly welcome.
 - You are.

101
00:11:48.960 --> 00:11:55.440
That is why we have decided.
 We move here.

102
00:12:00.360 --> 00:12:05.800
-What did you say?
 - We move to Ekberga.

103
00:12:05.960 --> 00:12:12.600
- Why don't you have said?
 - We wanted to surprise you.

104
00:12:12.760 --> 00:12:19.600
- The yard then, dad?
 - There are things that are more important.

105
00:12:19.760 --> 00:12:25.600
- We want to get closer to you.
 - How close then?

106
00:12:25.760 --> 00:12:30.320
What can it be?
 Twenty meters.

107
00:12:30.480 --> 00:12:36.160
It is the yellow house on the other side of the street.

108
00:12:36.320 --> 00:12:40.400
God, so much fun!

109
00:12:41.560 --> 00:12:46.040
You can look straight into the kitchen!

110
00:12:48.200 --> 00:12:54.240
Now it's serious.
 How should we solve this?

111
00:12:54.400 --> 00:12:58.840
We can wave to Grandma and Grandpa!

112
00:13:02.080 --> 00:13:04.680
Do you have a fire?

113
00:13:09.640 --> 00:13:15.400
-Good morning!
 - But mom, what time is it?

114
00:13:15.560 --> 00:13:21.840
Thank you for sleeping in your bed tonight.

115
00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:30.560
You have changed in the bathroom since last.
 The bath towel must have its own shelf.

116
00:13:30.720 --> 00:13:36.640
We have our own ideas on how we want to put things.

117
00:13:36.800 --> 00:13:41.280
Now I have arranged it.

118
00:13:41.440 --> 00:13:45.280
Where is Gustav?

119
00:13:45.440 --> 00:13:51.360
It is over seven o'clock.
 He has been running for a long time.

120
00:13:51.520 --> 00:13:59.320
- What are you doing this time?
 - We woke up five when Grandma vacuumed.

121
00:13:59.480 --> 00:14:05.520
- Should they move here?
 - We don't know how it will be.

122
00:14:06.880 --> 00:14:14.720
When you are as old as we do, you do not have the same need for your parents ...

123
00:14:16.120 --> 00:14:23.920
- Don't you want to meet us later?
 - Yes, but you probably don't want to meet us.

124
00:14:24.080 --> 00:14:31.560
-Why not?
 - We might put us into things.

125
00:14:31.720 --> 00:14:37.560
- We certainly want to meet you!
 - No, I say!

126
00:14:37.720 --> 00:14:42.520
Families are for split.

127
00:14:42.680 --> 00:14:47.520
- I am too small to hear that.
 -Me too.

128
00:14:47.680 --> 00:14:55.760
- Relieved the same ... - Barn, the grill is done!

129
00:14:55.920 --> 00:15:02.480
- Mom, I'm fourteen years old!
 - Go in and drink ...

130
00:15:09.520 --> 00:15:16.760
- Should you pull uphill then?
 - That's when it takes!

131
00:15:16.920 --> 00:15:21.360
In the last downhill you pulled on.

132
00:15:21.520 --> 00:15:27.960
- Did you go?
 - No, the bushes took the worst bang.

133
00:15:28.120 --> 00:15:34.560
- But the small guys got away.
 - It looked nasty.

134
00:15:34.720 --> 00:15:41.080
-Good morning darling.
 -What are you doing?

135
00:15:41.240 --> 00:15:46.240
Einar and I have jogged.
 I won.

136
00:15:46.400 --> 00:15:53.800
Gustav and I sat up yesterday, so it received some this morning.

137
00:15:53.960 --> 00:15:57.680
But it was a lovely brandy ...

138
00:16:01.040 --> 00:16:08.880
We ran past Gustav's new office.
 What a view he gets.
 The whole harbor!

139
00:16:10.880 --> 00:16:15.200
He can keep an eye on the boat.

140
00:16:15.360 --> 00:16:21.600
- How many berths were there?
 - Four front, two rear.

141
00:16:23.960 --> 00:16:29.480
-What are you doing?
 - Holds me in shape.

142
00:16:32.480 --> 00:16:36.920
Lillan ... what has mom said?

143
00:16:37.080 --> 00:16:43.920
"Set on the table pepper, salt because it is used for everything"

144
00:16:44.080 --> 00:16:48.680
In the spice shelf you do not find it.

145
00:16:50.440 --> 00:16:58.240
What are you usually say?
 "Today is the first day of the rest of your life."

146
00:17:03.400 --> 00:17:08.560
But so awful can't it be?

147
00:17:08.720 --> 00:17:16.520
- Imagine if your parents moved here!
 - They have been dead for seven years.

148
00:17:19.120 --> 00:17:23.240
Sorry, sara ...

149
00:17:24.400 --> 00:17:28.240
I forgot it.

150
00:17:28.400 --> 00:17:35.840
They will force me to have a hat when I go to the bank!

151
00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:43.040
I think you should have a hat when it's winter.

152
00:17:43.200 --> 00:17:49.760
-What is this?
 - Cookery coffee.
 Just as well you get used to it!

153
00:17:49.920 --> 00:17:55.600
Say you don't want them to move here.

154
00:17:55.760 --> 00:18:00.600
Gustav can tell the truth?

155
00:18:00.760 --> 00:18:09.000
He helps them buy the house - though he would not be fuss.

156
00:18:09.160 --> 00:18:16.240
But he's up again.
 Salary increase, promotion ... Sailboat.

157
00:18:16.400 --> 00:18:21.080
After all, he gets sick just he washing!

158
00:18:23.440 --> 00:18:30.720
I want to take care of myself!
 I'm an adult.
 What should I do?

159
00:18:30.880 --> 00:18:38.520
Break off a treo, mix down in half vodka, half carrot juice.

160
00:18:38.680 --> 00:18:42.920
I fix this.

161
00:18:43.080 --> 00:18:47.680
There is a lot that needs to be done.

162
00:18:47.840 --> 00:18:54.640
Just small pick.
 I know people who do that cheap!

163
00:18:54.800 --> 00:19:02.600
- Gustav knows where to watch.
 - I live in a similar house myself.

164
00:19:03.360 --> 00:19:11.080
-The inner walls are self-ignition ...-We became terrified when we heard it.

165
00:19:11.240 --> 00:19:19.040
We removed everything.
 But you first have to pick up the parquet and remove the moisture.

166
00:19:19.200 --> 00:19:24.040
It feels heavy with such a device ...

167
00:19:24.200 --> 00:19:32.000
Give me six months with the living room.
 We take the rest over the years to come.

168
00:19:32.160 --> 00:19:38.360
We have to wait - however boring it is.

169
00:19:38.520 --> 00:19:44.440
- Are you safe?
 - We can't cope with so much hassle.

170
00:19:44.600 --> 00:19:49.480
I promise me and Lena and Sara-

171
00:19:49.640 --> 00:19:54.520
- See find a new house for you!

172
00:19:54.680 --> 00:20:02.480
- I heard that Gunnarsson's house ... --... have burned down to the ground!

173
00:20:02.640 --> 00:20:08.480
- These are these walls.
 Deadly!
 -Yes.

174
00:20:08.640 --> 00:20:16.280
It should be a prison sentence for those who decide on the walls.

175
00:20:20.520 --> 00:20:26.640
Dear Margit, you have no idea what we have been through!

176
00:20:26.800 --> 00:20:31.280
We will come in exactly two hours.

177
00:20:31.440 --> 00:20:35.520
The car is heated.

178
00:20:35.680 --> 00:20:41.840
Why so molokna?
 See you on Einar's 75th birthday.

179
00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:46.160
It's four years there!

180
00:20:49.840 --> 00:20:54.760
But what a party it will be!

181
00:20:54.920 --> 00:21:02.480
If we have stood out on the farm for 50 years, we will probably be able to do another year.

182
00:21:02.640 --> 00:21:08.440
If any house is for sale we will call!

183
00:21:08.600 --> 00:21:15.040
Now we have to go.
 - Now have a hat on you when you go out!

184
00:21:17.280 --> 00:21:24.880
- Did you know that you have a top spouse?
 - mm.
 Bye daddy.
 Drive carefully.

185
00:21:27.440 --> 00:21:33.800
Why have you been keeping up for me all years that you are a genius?

186
00:21:33.960 --> 00:21:36.840
Thanks honey.

187
00:21:37.000 --> 00:21:43.080
-Where are you going?
 - I'm coming back on Monday.

188
00:21:43.240 --> 00:21:49.480
-What are you talking about?
 - It became very brandy.

189
00:21:49.640 --> 00:21:57.360
I said something about hunting license and safari.
 What 'damn would I say?

190
00:21:58.720 --> 00:22:03.680
So you are going with dad and Åke in search?

191
00:22:05.040 --> 00:22:07.200
Yes.

192
00:22:10.480 --> 00:22:14.800
I'll live in their tent.

193
00:22:14.960 --> 00:22:22.760
Einar said that if you have sleeping mats you can get plus degrees in the sleeping bag.

194
00:22:22.920 --> 00:22:27.480
As you make your bed so you must lie...

195
00:22:28.320 --> 00:22:31.920
Thanks and goodbye!

196
00:23:11.480 --> 00:23:13.720
