00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:57.160
Now Göran is shooting again.
 Yesterday he pulled heating loops on the porch.

2
00:00:57.320 --> 00:01:02.720
C. Head talkative self immediately saw C. Head talk there was something wrong with him.

3
00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:08.560
- Why do you just O'boy for you?
 C. Head talk - in this country ...

4
00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:14.680
C. Head talk ... no one can be pleased with C. Head talk that others are doing well!

5
00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:20.680

10
00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:48.640
C. Head talk - a idiot.
 - Göran is shooting morning and evening.

11
00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:53.640
C. Head talkative man's C. Head talkative struggle against the elements.

12
00:01:53.800 --> 00:02:00.640
His wife does not have to scoop out of the bathroom window anyway.

13
00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:06.160
C. Head talkative self should take care of it.
 C. Head talk - Max, pick up the snow shovel!

14
00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:12.160
- I take care of the home and you garden.
 C. Head talk - ORDUST, I want to change.

19
00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:40.040
I am allgeric!

20
00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:46.000
Everyone is just trying to throw away their tasks.

21
00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:50.200
Yes, it is best that you do everything.

22
00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:55.000
- You have five seconds on you!
 -One two...

23
00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:07.560
Mom, there is someone who is shooting ... how did you do?

24
00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:13.120
I said I had lost the remote control there.

25
00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:19.800
Here are sandwiches and chocolate.
 How was school?

26
00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:27.840
Math interviews ... The gym teacher was sick, so then Eva and I went smoking.

27
00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:32.200
-What are you saying?
 - The truth.

28
00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:36.200
Why do you tell the truth?

29
00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:41.600
Our teacher says we should be honest.

30
00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:45.000
So stupid!

31
00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:50.920
Do you not belong to the open parent generation?

32
00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:56.920
Do we do well ... you are 15 years old and curious about life.

33
00:03:57.080 --> 00:04:04.320
You want to explore things that we may have difficulty accepting, such as smoking ...

34
00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:09.320
... guys, snuff and sex and stuff.

35
00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:16.320
- Should you have secrets?
 - You can be a little low sometimes.

36
00:04:16.480 --> 00:04:22.240
Grandma knows e.g.
 Not that Dad is a postman.

37
00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:28.040
Last time they talked, he was certainly the commander.

38
00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:33.440
C. Head talk - so it was clear!
 - Are you already done?

39
00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:42.800
C. Head Tapers Don't You Don't On Me?
 After 20 years of C. Head talk, side by side ...

40
00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:48.800
-Move!
 C. Head Tapers - Okay, okay.
 It's cold out there ...

41
00:04:50.200 --> 00:04:58.440
- Why don't guys make things clearly?
 - People are half finished.

42
00:04:58.600 --> 00:05:05.200
The body works fine, but we women are allowed to talk about what to do with it.

43
00:05:09.720 --> 00:05:15.560
- Do you come and go to bed?
 C. Head talk - I can't touch me.

44
00:05:16.600 --> 00:05:21.440
Shot a little more often, so you don't get hurt.
 Look at Göran!

45
00:05:21.600 --> 00:05:30.280
C. Head talk - I don't want to look at Göran.

 We haven't been able to talk so much with each other -

52
00:06:09.240 --> 00:06:15.080
- But I immediately felt that we would have nice contact ...

53

C. Head talkatist what you want?

54
00:06:21.520 --> 00:06:29.120

55
00:06:31.800 --> 00:06:39.080
I would like to surprise her with something nice, but I'm not so ...

56
00:06:39.240 --> 00:06:43.360
C. Head Tapers - Clip?
 - Not so inventive.

57
00:06:43.520 --> 00:06:50.480
Whatever I do, she will never be surprised, so I was going to ask you.

58
00:06:54.600 --> 00:07:01.600
C. Head Tapraredu wants help in surprising your C. Head talk?

C. Head talkative this year is the snow depth, C. Head talkative guests are picked up with horse and sled.

70
00:08:08.320 --> 00:08:12.640
C. Head talkative self tries to tell C. Head talk for a nice time.

77
00:09:02.280 --> 00:09:07.920
C. Head talkative self is attentive.
 C. Head talkative self always drives her to the riding school.

78
00:09:08.080 --> 00:09:11.920
She stopped riding a year ago.

79
00:09:12.080 --> 00:09:18.000
The C. Head talk was why she got so angry when C. Head talkative self dropped her at the stable.

80
00:09:18.160 --> 00:09:22.000
She is getting new interests.

- I think we talk so rarely.
 -Sch.

124
00:14:08.960 --> 00:14:14.200
It's good that you are independent, but ...

125
00:14:14.360 --> 00:14:20.200
- Sometimes I want to know what you are thinking.
 -I do not think so.

126
00:14:20.360 --> 00:14:27.280
One should be responsive to each other's wishes.

127
00:14:27.440 --> 00:14:34.000
There may be things you want to do that we do not know about.
 Fishing and so ...

128
00:14:34.160 --> 00:14:38.560
- Mom, do you need support and comfort?
 -Yes...

129

- Imagine on my husband.

133
00:15:07.160 --> 00:15:10.640
Not the same way ...

134
00:15:10.800 --> 00:15:17.360
- How is Göran as a husband?
 -Wonderful!

135
00:15:17.520 --> 00:15:24.800
He is safe, kind, honest and ... he loves me.

136
00:15:24.960 --> 00:15:30.320
Am I so stupid so I ask ...

137
00:15:30.480 --> 00:15:37.520
Tomorrow is our first wedding day and then we will go to Solgläntan.

138
00:15:37.680 --> 00:15:44.240
- Want to see the brochure?
 - I know it outside.

140
00:15:50.600 --> 00:15:55.280
- What have you done then?
 - Wear hockey.

141
00:15:55.440 --> 00:15:59.760
- Are you such a hockey fan?
 -No.

142
00:15:59.920 --> 00:16:06.560
- Have you told Gustav?
 - Yes, then we went on a bandy instead.

143
00:16:06.720 --> 00:16:13.480
But you have much else in common.
 Your children, for example.

144
00:16:13.640 --> 00:16:19.040
I would give a lot for such lovely kids.

145
00:16:19.200 --> 00:16:23.040
How much do you have?

146
00:16:23.200 --> 00:16:31.400
Honey, is this you are?
 Oh, what I have longed for you!

147
00:16:31.560 --> 00:16:38.200

C. Head talk - What was it with her?
 - Gustav, I want to talk to you.

151
00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:31.840
-Where have you been?
 C. Head talk - run around a bit and thought.

152
00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:38.120
C. Head talk - I should do it more often.
 -Drive around?

153
00:17:38.280 --> 00:17:43.600
The C. Head Tapers there with the Sun Glue C. Head talkative response an idiotic idea.

154
00:17:43.760 --> 00:17:49.600
It is we who need to travel away and do something romantic.

155
