1
00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:22.800
These men believe that they are soon on their way home to Stockholm.

2
00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:44.040
But they are cheated.

3
00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:54.520
For King Kristian II of Denmark is not to be trusted.

4
00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:59.600
He will be known in Sweden as Kristian tyrant.

5
00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:06.320
Instead of letting them go home, he throws them in jail.

6
00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:22.680
King Kristian II does not know about it, but when he lurks the Swedish nobles -

7
00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:27.960
- And takes them to Denmark, so he teaches one of them a very important homework.

8
00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:32.120
A lesson to never trust King Kristian.

9
00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:36.280
It will save this man from being beheaded -

10
00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:40.760
- And instead make him king over Sweden.

11
00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:44.320
Known as Gustav Vasa.

12
00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:56.000
We are in the late Middle Ages.
 A time in the pest's cruel shadow -

13
00:01:56.160 --> 00:02:01.880
- Filled with bloody rebellion and evil death.

14
00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:06.920
Many get into the power struggle about Sweden and the Swedish throne.

15
00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:12.280
But only one will succeed.

16
00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:16.920
But it will require him to be both cunning and ruthless.

17
00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:27.160
This is the story of our country.

18
00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:32.440
About the people and forces that have shaped it -

19
00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:37.480
- Endure from the ice age until our days.

20
00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:55.720
This is the story of Sweden.

21
00:03:18.960 --> 00:03:25.080
From the mid-1300s, the plague draws in waves across Europe.

22
00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:27.480
Gotland is hit hard.

23
00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:31.640
The once flourishing island has a hard time rising.

24
00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:35.480
And now the next accident is soon here.

25
00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:42.600
They are on their way to the churches.
 It is urgent.

26
00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:46.480
Now the bells have to call to warn the population.

27
00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:50.600
/Church bells squeeze/

28
00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:09.200
Gotland is invaded.

29
00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:22.040
When the alarm is heard over the island, the farmers hurry to get ready for battle.

30
00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:28.840
For Gotland's army consists of farmers.

31
00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:35.280
The farmers on Gotland would by law have equipment for battle.

32
00:04:36.920 --> 00:04:42.880
They are armed with brows, shields and weapons.
 And they can fight.

33
00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:49.280
But on the other hand, they were not prepared for such a large invasion as we see here.

34
00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:53.680
All war -capable men are preparing for war.

35
00:04:53.840 --> 00:04:58.600
From the age of 15, one would participate in the defense.

36
00:05:02.040 --> 00:05:05.720
But some still had to stay home.

37
00:05:05.880 --> 00:05:10.960
Probably they wanted to make sure that some younger ones survive -

38
00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:14.840
- And take care of the yard.

39
00:05:23.520 --> 00:05:29.040
The one who attacks Gotland is the Danish king Valdemar Atterdag.

40
00:05:29.200 --> 00:05:35.680
He has an army of close to 2,000 Danish soldiers and German lego nectar.

41
00:05:35.840 --> 00:05:42.520
Valdemar Atterdag is king in Denmark, and he wants to make his kingdom bigger.

42
00:05:42.680 --> 00:05:47.800
He has conquered Skåne, Halland, Blekinge and Öland.

43
00:05:47.960 --> 00:05:51.880
And now Gotland is in turn.

44
00:06:00.840 --> 00:06:04.640
Around Gotland, coins and valuables are dug down -

45
00:06:04.800 --> 00:06:08.640
- To be safe there until the victory is won ...

46
00:06:08.800 --> 00:06:12.560
... or the looting is over.

47
00:06:40.320 --> 00:06:45.200
The farmer soldiers walk towards Visby to meet the enemy.

48
00:06:45.360 --> 00:06:48.360
They are moving towards a battle that has dramatic consequences -

49
00:06:48.520 --> 00:06:52.240
- For both Sweden and their own future.

50
00:07:10.440 --> 00:07:15.840
Outside Visby's walls, the peasant army has gathered to defend the island.

51
00:07:21.480 --> 00:07:28.280
They stand with their loved ones - neighbors, cousins, fathers ...

52
00:07:30.680 --> 00:07:33.360
... and sons.

53
00:07:36.400 --> 00:07:41.400
We do not know why the peasant army chooses to gather outside Visby.

54
00:07:41.560 --> 00:07:46.400
They may have been so that they wanted support from the city.

55
00:07:46.560 --> 00:07:50.080
But the gates do not seem to have been opened.

56
00:07:50.240 --> 00:07:56.120
The Visby residents and farmers have long been a conflict on trade in the Baltic Sea.

57
00:07:56.280 --> 00:08:02.320
The city wall was built to exclude the farmers from the important trade.

58
00:08:02.480 --> 00:08:06.600
So the relationship between the farmers and the city is bad.

59
00:08:06.760 --> 00:08:11.600
You do not know how Visby acted in connection with the battle at the Ring Wall -

60
00:08:11.760 --> 00:08:14.920
- But it is believed that the city was passive.

61
00:08:15.080 --> 00:08:19.560
They wanted to wait and see what happened.

62
00:08:24.040 --> 00:08:29.680
On July 27, 1361, the battle at Visby stands.

63
00:08:42.480 --> 00:08:46.160
And when the invading army lets the arrows rain -

64
00:08:46.320 --> 00:08:50.640
- Has the Gotland peasant army not long in life.

65
00:09:00.120 --> 00:09:03.320
The Danes who came were all professionals.

66
00:09:03.480 --> 00:09:07.520
In the long term, strength conditions were unequal.

67
00:09:18.720 --> 00:09:23.200
The invading army continues to chop and settle forward -

68
00:09:23.360 --> 00:09:26.560
- And panic erupts among the farmers.

69
00:09:26.720 --> 00:09:31.760
But with the back to the ring wall, there is nowhere to escape.

70
00:09:35.800 --> 00:09:42.000
On the battlefield outside Visby, upwards of 1,800 Gotlanders die on this day.

71
00:09:54.600 --> 00:09:58.680
Almost all the island's farmers have come to fight.

72
00:09:58.840 --> 00:10:03.640
Valdemar Atterdag and his German lego nectar do not negotiate.

73
00:10:03.800 --> 00:10:07.200
And they take no prisoners.

74
00:10:21.320 --> 00:10:27.760
Over 500 years later you will find mass graves from the Battle of Visby.

75
00:10:27.920 --> 00:10:31.360
Nearly 1,200 skeletons.

76
00:10:33.600 --> 00:10:39.760
As a Gotlander, you become very personally engaged in this -

77
00:10:39.920 --> 00:10:45.120
- Although it was 600 years ago, you can very well relate to -

78
00:10:45.280 --> 00:10:50.640
- That people go out of houses to defend their hometown and your family.

79
00:10:50.800 --> 00:10:55.800
The youngest skeletons with combat damage are about 16 years old -

80
00:10:55.960 --> 00:11:01.760
- And the youngest individuals in the graves are around 15 years old.

81
00:11:11.080 --> 00:11:17.000
When the battle is over, a large part of Gotland's defense is eradicated.

82
00:11:17.160 --> 00:11:22.040
The future of the Visby residents is now in King Valdemar's hands.

83
00:11:22.200 --> 00:11:28.240
He is said to have threatened to burn down the city if the Visby residents did not pay a fee.

84
00:11:28.400 --> 00:11:31.360
A so -called fire assessment.

85
00:11:38.360 --> 00:11:43.920
There is a well -known painting depicting the fire estimation of Visby.

86
00:11:44.080 --> 00:11:49.520
It hides here, in the National Museum's magazine.

87
00:11:58.240 --> 00:12:03.680
Many of you may recognize it from the history books.

88
00:12:16.120 --> 00:12:22.000
It is from 1882, and is thus painted many hundreds of years later.

89
00:12:22.160 --> 00:12:26.120
It depicts something that probably never took place.

90
00:12:26.280 --> 00:12:30.280
There is no evidence that King Valdemar threatened to burn down the city -

91
00:12:30.440 --> 00:12:36.520
- If he did not get barrels filled with valuables, as the board tells.

92
00:12:36.680 --> 00:12:41.520
The board describes a story that is recorded from the 17th century.

93
00:12:41.680 --> 00:12:46.480
The fire estimation has not happened, but the city seems to have had to pay -

94
00:12:46.640 --> 00:12:50.880
—Shere form of money and maybe goods to Valdemar -

95
00:12:51.040 --> 00:12:55.040
- To avoid ravages and looting.

96
00:13:00.240 --> 00:13:04.240
Following the Battle of Visby, Gotland's rural - is plundered -

97
00:13:04.400 --> 00:13:07.280
- Of the invading forces.

98
00:13:30.800 --> 00:13:36.320
No one knows how many taxes were dug down and remained in the ground.

99
00:13:40.600 --> 00:13:46.600
But among those found is the down tax from central Gotland.

100
00:13:48.920 --> 00:13:53.680
The largest medieval treasure in Scandinavia.

101
00:13:59.040 --> 00:14:03.960
Valdemar has directed a hard blow to Sweden when he conquers Gotland.

102
00:14:04.120 --> 00:14:08.160
But it will not be Valdemar who takes power over Sweden.

103
00:14:08.320 --> 00:14:13.480
Instead, Margareta will do, Valdemar's daughter.

104
00:14:14.720 --> 00:14:19.560
So far she is just a little eight year old at home in Denmark.

105
00:14:19.720 --> 00:14:26.320
But she will be one of Europe's foremost female regents ever.

106
00:14:28.920 --> 00:14:33.960
In the mid-1300s, the map of Sweden does not look like today.

107
00:14:34.120 --> 00:14:37.240
Parts of southern Sweden are in Danish hands.

108
00:14:37.400 --> 00:14:42.440
The fighting for power is constantly drawing on the boundaries.

109
00:14:42.600 --> 00:14:46.600
Ordinary people's farms can be located in a lifetime -

110
00:14:46.760 --> 00:14:50.360
- Both Swedish and Danish land.

111
00:14:51.520 --> 00:14:55.080
But for most people it doesn't mean much.

112
00:14:55.240 --> 00:15:01.680
They did not identify yourself as a Swedish but as a small lander or the West Goth.

113
00:15:01.840 --> 00:15:06.520
You belonged to your landscape or your village or maybe your city.

114
00:15:06.680 --> 00:15:10.720
You did not see it as belonging to a nation.

115
00:15:12.840 --> 00:15:17.440
And people have something else to think about than which king governs.

116
00:15:17.600 --> 00:15:22.480
For the plague returns in waves during the 1300s and 1400s-

117
00:15:22.640 --> 00:15:26.640
- And it is generally a messy time for many.

118
00:15:26.800 --> 00:15:32.480
It is a time of political chaos.
 In the 1360s, three kings govern in Sweden.

119
00:15:32.640 --> 00:15:36.800
There is civil war, and in the Baltic Sea pirates ravage.

120
00:15:36.960 --> 00:15:39.400
So it's very worried.

121
00:15:39.560 --> 00:15:44.240
But from the political chaos, something new will emerge.

122
00:15:53.840 --> 00:15:57.840
Valdemar Atterdag's daughter Margareta is now an adult.

123
00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:03.880
She is 44 years old and has been victorious from the fighting for power in Sweden.

124
00:16:04.040 --> 00:16:08.760
She has made herself a queen and regent of not only Sweden -

125
00:16:08.920 --> 00:16:11.720
–On also Denmark and Norway.

126
00:16:11.880 --> 00:16:17.000
Now she is in Kalmar castle to strengthen and consolidate her power.

127
00:16:17.160 --> 00:16:22.040
Margareta is a skilled politician and an extremely skilled negotiator.

128
00:16:22.200 --> 00:16:27.160
She has a relationship that gives her a very good position.

129
00:16:27.320 --> 00:16:30.760
Her father Valdemar Atterdag: King over Denmark.

130
00:16:30.920 --> 00:16:34.280
Her husband Håkan: King over Norway.

131
00:16:34.440 --> 00:16:39.560
Her father -in -law Magnus Eriksson: King over Sweden and former Norway.

132
00:16:39.720 --> 00:16:44.560
In this way, she can claim power over all three kingdoms.

133
00:16:46.960 --> 00:16:50.960
Margareta is not just an intelligent politician.

134
00:16:51.120 --> 00:16:56.720
She is also actionable and takes violence if needed.

135
00:16:56.880 --> 00:17:02.960
And now Margareta wants to tie the countries in the Nordic countries into a large union.

136
00:17:07.120 --> 00:17:12.080
Parts of the Swedish nobility oppose Margaret's plans -

137
00:17:12.240 --> 00:17:18.080
- But as a skilled negotiator, she wins over the most powerful in her cause.

138
00:17:18.240 --> 00:17:22.320
In addition, many want calm and stability in Sweden -

139
00:17:22.480 --> 00:17:25.840
- And that's something Margareta promises.

140
00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:30.440
Therefore, they support the idea with the Kalmar Union.

141
00:17:35.240 --> 00:17:42.400
The Kalmar Union means that a king should control the three Nordic kingdoms:

142
00:17:42.560 --> 00:17:46.920
Swedish, the Danish and the Norwegian.

143
00:17:47.080 --> 00:17:51.800
What happens in Kalmar 1397 is that Margareta looks to -

144
00:17:51.960 --> 00:17:57.920
- That her adoptive son Erik of Pomerania is elected king over the Union.

145
00:17:59.160 --> 00:18:04.240
The three kingdoms will function fairly independently within the Kalmar Union.

146
00:18:04.400 --> 00:18:08.640
Each kingdom must have a national council and manage its internal affairs.

147
00:18:08.800 --> 00:18:15.080
Over them, a king should have power, especially over foreign policy.

148
00:18:17.640 --> 00:18:22.760
Foreign policy at this time is very much about war and trade.

149
00:18:22.920 --> 00:18:27.760
And it is precisely the trade in the Baltic Sea that Margareta wants to gain control over.

150
00:18:27.920 --> 00:18:33.960
A German trade association dominates and has a monopoly at the Baltic Sea trade.

151
00:18:34.120 --> 00:18:37.520
The Trade Federation is called Hansan -

152
00:18:37.680 --> 00:18:41.920
- And for Margareta, the Kalmar Union is a way to challenge Hansan.

153
00:18:42.080 --> 00:18:45.200
Many people think Hansan has become too powerful-

154
00:18:45.360 --> 00:18:49.280
- And want to access the money that Hansan earns.

155
00:18:49.440 --> 00:18:53.880
The idea is that during a Union King, the Nordic countries can be strong enough -

156
00:18:54.040 --> 00:18:57.160
- Pressing back Hansan.

157
00:18:57.320 --> 00:19:01.920
The land areas of the Kalmar Union extend all the way from Finland in the east -

158
00:19:02.080 --> 00:19:05.040
- To Greenland in the west.

159
00:19:05.200 --> 00:19:08.160
Margareta succeeds in the negotiations.

160
00:19:08.320 --> 00:19:11.360
The huge Kalmar Union becomes reality.

161
00:19:11.520 --> 00:19:17.560
But there is a problem: the Union is on an unstable foundation.

162
00:19:17.720 --> 00:19:23.800
The meeting in Kalmar was big politics, with negotiations that lasted for weeks.

163
00:19:25.800 --> 00:19:28.880
There is still a resistance -

164
00:19:29.040 --> 00:19:34.480
- Among some of the rich and powerful Swedish nobles.

165
00:19:34.640 --> 00:19:38.880
They want to make sure that Sweden remains an election kingdom -

166
00:19:39.040 --> 00:19:45.960
- And that "domestic men" sit in Swedish castles and counties, not Danes.

167
00:19:46.120 --> 00:19:51.600
A struggle arises between Danish royal power with the Union King on one side-

168
00:19:51.760 --> 00:19:57.680
- And parts of the Swedish nobility, who want more self -government, on the other.

169
00:20:03.000 --> 00:20:08.080
The conflict becomes a problem for the Union throughout its existence.

170
00:20:12.760 --> 00:20:18.680
But at the moment Sweden, Norway and Denmark have a new king - on paper.

171
00:20:18.840 --> 00:20:23.160
The first Union King: Erik of Pomerania.

172
00:20:24.280 --> 00:20:27.360
But in practice, Erik can only control in Norway.

173
00:20:27.520 --> 00:20:32.320
In Sweden and Denmark, Margareta still decides.

174
00:20:37.720 --> 00:20:44.240
But it is plague times and anyone can be affected, at any time.

175
00:20:50.160 --> 00:20:55.520
Queen Margareta died in 1412 in Flensburg.

176
00:20:55.680 --> 00:20:59.960
She was there to negotiate, and probably died of the plague.

177
00:21:03.480 --> 00:21:08.040
And with Margaret's death, power is instead at Erik.

178
00:21:08.200 --> 00:21:14.920
He fails to keep the Kalmar union together as skilled as Margareta.

179
00:21:15.080 --> 00:21:20.080
He threw the country into a war against Hansan, which was very expensive.

180
00:21:20.240 --> 00:21:23.920
He raised taxes to pay for the war -

181
00:21:24.080 --> 00:21:29.320
- And he was very badly seen in the Swedish Empire at all.

182
00:21:34.040 --> 00:21:40.040
In the 1430s, it starts to crack a lot in the joints of the Kalmar Union.

183
00:21:41.080 --> 00:21:44.120
The time of rebellion dawns.

184
00:21:45.160 --> 00:21:51.960
Everything starts in Bergslagen.
 Erik's war against Hansan hit the mountain men hard.

185
00:21:52.120 --> 00:21:56.120
The mountain men are dependent on Hansan for his trade with the iron -

186
00:21:56.280 --> 00:21:59.280
- That comes directly from their blast furnaces.

187
00:21:59.440 --> 00:22:04.440
And it is the mountain men in Bergslagen who themselves manage the trade with Hansan.

188
00:22:04.600 --> 00:22:09.760
When Erik of Pomerania lets his vessels attack Hansan's ship in the Baltic Sea -

189
00:22:09.920 --> 00:22:15.840
- It distinguishes the trade with Bergslagen, and it awakens the anger of the people.

190
00:22:17.120 --> 00:22:22.160
And when Erik, to finance the war against Hansan, raises taxes -

191
00:22:22.320 --> 00:22:26.640
–And the taxes are driven by a hated Danish bailiff in Bergslagen -

192
00:22:26.800 --> 00:22:30.760
- Yes, then it will be the drop that causes the beaker to run over.

193
00:22:30.920 --> 00:22:34.320
A rebellion flares up.

194
00:22:43.480 --> 00:22:48.960
The people of Bergslagen are now starting to end up behind this man.

195
00:22:51.000 --> 00:22:54.240
Engelbrekt Engelbrektsson collects the people -

196
00:22:54.400 --> 00:22:59.120
- To be known as the Engelbrekts rebellion.

197
00:23:00.560 --> 00:23:06.080
Engelbrekt comes from Bergslagen.
 He is a mountain man and the lowadel-

198
00:23:06.240 --> 00:23:11.640
- And has very strong financial interests in Bergslagen.

199
00:23:13.040 --> 00:23:18.240
Engelbrekt is central.
 He has the ability to gather large crowds-

200
00:23:18.400 --> 00:23:23.400
- As he follows him in the rebellion he is involved in and starts.

201
00:23:24.400 --> 00:23:29.480
Engelbrech's purposes are two.
 First, dismiss Erik of Pomerania.

202
00:23:29.640 --> 00:23:34.720
Secondly, support in particular the inhabitants of the cities and citizens -

203
00:23:34.880 --> 00:23:40.560
- And the mountain men in their financial interests, which have been threatened by the war.

204
00:23:44.480 --> 00:23:48.280
Engelbrekt's rebellion spreads from Bergslagen.

205
00:23:48.440 --> 00:23:51.600
His forces reach down to southern Halland-

206
00:23:51.760 --> 00:23:55.480
- And he gets supporters all the way up in the Finnish Ostrobothnia.

207
00:23:55.640 --> 00:23:58.640
He is well on his way to defeat Erik by Pomerania -

208
00:23:58.800 --> 00:24:02.800
- And free Sweden from Danish supremacy.

209
00:24:04.000 --> 00:24:09.560
But the Swedish nobility is worried that Engelbrekt becomes too strong and powerful -

210
00:24:09.720 --> 00:24:15.160
- And before he gets control over Sweden, they turn him back.

211
00:24:23.280 --> 00:24:27.280
Two years after the Engelbrekts rebellion starts ...

212
00:24:30.680 --> 00:24:35.440
... it ends when Engelbrekt is killed in a feud.

213
00:24:40.520 --> 00:24:47.240
After his death, the power struggle continues on the rule of the Kalmar Union and Sweden.

214
00:24:47.400 --> 00:24:50.240
Erik of Pomerania is set aside -

215
00:24:50.400 --> 00:24:55.680
- And the new union kings that come after him will not be long -lasting.

216
00:24:55.840 --> 00:25:02.080
Several Swedish noblemen continue to counteract the Danish union kings.

217
00:25:05.080 --> 00:25:10.920
The conflict around the Kalmar Union is raging throughout the 15th century.

218
00:25:11.080 --> 00:25:16.440
A city that ends up in the firing line is Lödöse in Västergötland.

219
00:25:18.960 --> 00:25:25.640
After quarrels with Norway, the city's trade operations are forced to move a few miles.

220
00:25:25.800 --> 00:25:30.520
And with the trade, many of Lödö's residents move.

221
00:25:36.560 --> 00:25:42.680
Remains will then be a lot of possessions from people who lived in Lödöse.

222
00:25:42.840 --> 00:25:48.400
That is why we have such a great wealth of archaeological finds from Gamla Lödöse.

223
00:25:48.560 --> 00:25:53.680
You have actually found things about how the children were doing.

224
00:26:01.280 --> 00:26:07.920
We have a brick where a child has trampled and left his footsteps.

225
00:26:08.080 --> 00:26:14.160
This may indicate that children had to help, perhaps in brick production.

226
00:26:22.680 --> 00:26:27.400
But we have also found finds that show that children were allowed to be children.

227
00:26:27.560 --> 00:26:30.600
Toys we have found a number.

228
00:26:40.240 --> 00:26:44.200
Everything from balls to woodwall.

229
00:26:44.360 --> 00:26:50.400
And icebound, or skates, made of cow and horse legs.

230
00:26:52.920 --> 00:26:58.080
Although there was time for ball games and skates for medieval children -

231
00:26:58.240 --> 00:27:03.040
- So they probably had to spend most of the time helping their parents.

232
00:27:03.200 --> 00:27:09.680
It was a rule that the children took the same profession as their parents.

233
00:27:09.840 --> 00:27:15.960
But there is another path that breaks this pattern.

234
00:27:16.120 --> 00:27:19.160
Namely the path of the church.

235
00:27:25.080 --> 00:27:31.600
Some choose it as a career.
 And it can lead all the way to the Pope in Rome.

236
00:27:31.760 --> 00:27:35.240
It is the center of power at this time.

237
00:27:35.400 --> 00:27:41.080
And all the way there reaches a man from Lilla Hossmo in Småland.

238
00:27:42.280 --> 00:27:47.280
Hemming Gadh will later become a tray in the game about the Swedish throne -

239
00:27:47.440 --> 00:27:52.280
- When he gives advice to Sweden's future king, Gustav Vasa.

240
00:27:53.320 --> 00:27:58.080
Hemming Gadh is a climber.
 He belongs to the lower upper class.

241
00:27:58.240 --> 00:28:03.800
He reads as a priest and becomes secretary to the bishop in Linköping.

242
00:28:03.960 --> 00:28:09.800
There he is discovered by the governor Sten Sture the older:

243
00:28:09.960 --> 00:28:14.560
"That guy is smart. I want him as envoy in Rome."

244
00:28:14.720 --> 00:28:21.240
Hemming rises in the degrees and becomes the chamberlain for Pope Alexander VI.

245
00:28:21.400 --> 00:28:24.520
The Pope's Palace will be an important school.

246
00:28:24.680 --> 00:28:29.160
What Hemming learns is the ruthless game of power.

247
00:28:29.320 --> 00:28:33.320
Pope Alexander VI and his family, the Borgia family -

248
00:28:33.480 --> 00:28:39.600
- is described by Machiavelli in the book Fursten as the watch type of evil.

249
00:28:39.760 --> 00:28:45.120
Hemming Gadh is taught in gaining power and retaining them at all costs.

250
00:28:45.280 --> 00:28:50.360
And he takes that mindset with him when he comes home to Sweden.

251
00:28:55.840 --> 00:29:00.840
It is not just ideas about ruthless rulers that are spread in Europe.

252
00:29:01.000 --> 00:29:07.120
The Renaissance flourishes, and ancient thoughts on art and science -

253
00:29:07.280 --> 00:29:11.280
- Get new life.
 In the end, this also affects Sweden.

254
00:29:17.360 --> 00:29:20.840
During the 15th century comes the art of printing.

255
00:29:21.000 --> 00:29:25.600
In 1483, Sweden's first book is printed.

256
00:29:25.760 --> 00:29:32.920
Previously, books had been copied by hand, but now they become a mass medium.

257
00:29:33.080 --> 00:29:39.800
A revolutionary invention that makes it easier to spread different messages.

258
00:29:39.960 --> 00:29:45.520
And the art of letterpress will have a huge effect on society.

259
00:29:47.640 --> 00:29:53.560
It also has the higher education institutions.
 A few years before the first book is printed in Sweden -

260
00:29:53.720 --> 00:29:57.720
- The country's first university in Uppsala is inaugurated.

261
00:29:57.880 --> 00:30:04.080
Thus, Sweden is trained closer to Europe and the universities on the continent.

262
00:30:12.760 --> 00:30:15.960
The Renaissance also affects the art.

263
00:30:16.120 --> 00:30:20.280
Around Sweden, artwork is created with a new style.

264
00:30:20.440 --> 00:30:24.200
The main painter is named Albertus Pictor -

265
00:30:24.360 --> 00:30:29.920
- And his art can be seen in many churches around Sweden.

266
00:30:43.200 --> 00:30:47.200
At the beginning of the 16th century, Hemming Gadh comes home to Sweden-

267
00:30:47.360 --> 00:30:50.600
- With their experiences from Rome.

268
00:30:54.840 --> 00:30:58.400
At the castle Tre Kronor in Stockholm he becomes an adviser -

269
00:30:58.560 --> 00:31:01.960
- A new generation of power players.

270
00:31:02.120 --> 00:31:07.960
One of them is the young Gustav Eriksson of the Vaasa family.

271
00:31:09.360 --> 00:31:12.360
Sometimes Gustav is portrayed as underdog.

272
00:31:12.520 --> 00:31:17.480
But that is not the case, because he belongs to the real social elite in Sweden.

273
00:31:17.640 --> 00:31:22.800
Both of his parents were high.
 His aunt Kristina Gyllenstierna -

274
00:31:22.960 --> 00:31:27.000
- Was married to the Governor Sten Sture the younger one.

275
00:31:29.480 --> 00:31:35.800
But despite that, he was far from a candidate to the Swedish throne.

276
00:31:48.800 --> 00:31:52.080
Hemming shares his experiences from Rome-

277
00:31:52.240 --> 00:31:56.520
- And learns the young Gustav Vasa to play the game of power.

278
00:32:07.720 --> 00:32:12.120
And the lessons will be used by Gustav.

279
00:32:22.560 --> 00:32:28.800
Soon he will meet someone who seems to be an extremely ruthless ruler.

280
00:32:30.760 --> 00:32:35.440
Namely the Danish king Kristian II.

281
00:32:35.600 --> 00:32:40.680
He who will be known to all Swedes as Kristian Tyrann.

282
00:32:51.800 --> 00:32:55.400
We are now 18 years into the 16th century.

283
00:32:55.560 --> 00:32:59.840
It has been over 100 years since Margareta created the Kalmar Union -

284
00:33:00.000 --> 00:33:04.480
- And the union kings still find it difficult to control Sweden.

285
00:33:04.640 --> 00:33:07.920
The resistance is strong.

286
00:33:15.360 --> 00:33:20.480
Kristian, the latest Union King, has just tried to conquer Stockholm -

287
00:33:20.640 --> 00:33:24.440
- To knock down the resistance.
 But he fails.

288
00:33:24.600 --> 00:33:28.000
Instead, he must negotiate peace.

289
00:33:28.160 --> 00:33:33.000
Prior to negotiations, it was common to change hostage with each other.

290
00:33:33.160 --> 00:33:38.720
A number of tall people were left to one side, and were replaced by the other-

291
00:33:38.880 --> 00:33:43.200
- To have the negotiations in peace and quiet.

292
00:33:44.280 --> 00:33:47.280
Together with some Swedish nobles -

293
00:33:47.440 --> 00:33:53.120
- Has Gustav Eriksson Vaasa and Hemming Gadh was exchanged as hostage.

294
00:33:53.280 --> 00:33:57.760
But to everyone's surprise, Kristian chooses not to negotiate at all.

295
00:34:04.720 --> 00:34:11.120
Instead of negotiating, Kristian takes the hostage that catches.

296
00:34:13.640 --> 00:34:18.520
And in this way Gustav learns not to trust Kristian.

297
00:34:18.680 --> 00:34:23.040
A lesson that one day will save his life.

298
00:34:27.360 --> 00:34:33.360
Gustav sits the prisoner in Denmark.
 But after almost a year he manages to accommodate.

299
00:34:38.240 --> 00:34:41.520
Gustav flees to Hansestaden Lübeck-

300
00:34:41.680 --> 00:34:45.480
–And gets back from there to Sweden.

301
00:34:47.240 --> 00:34:51.720
Hemming Gadh, on the other hand, he does not flee.
 On the contrary.

302
00:34:51.880 --> 00:34:58.440
A couple of years later, when Kristian II again tries to conquer Stockholm -

303
00:34:58.600 --> 00:35:04.800
- So it is with Gadh by his side.
 He will help Kristian take the city.

304
00:35:04.960 --> 00:35:09.560
I think Kristian appeals to Hemming Gadh's vanity.

305
00:35:09.720 --> 00:35:14.200
"You are so wise and wise, and you are not appreciated in this camp."

306
00:35:14.360 --> 00:35:18.520
"This is not a national conflict, there are different interests."

307
00:35:18.680 --> 00:35:22.080
"You can gain from supporting me."

308
00:35:25.800 --> 00:35:31.080
Regardless of Hemming's motive, he can lead the woman who leads Stockholm's defense -

309
00:35:31.240 --> 00:35:36.240
- Opening the city's gates and giving up the opposition to King Kristian.

310
00:35:36.400 --> 00:35:40.120
That woman is none other than Kristina Gyllenstierna -

311
00:35:40.280 --> 00:35:44.920
- Sink to the Governor Sten Sture.

312
00:35:45.080 --> 00:35:48.680
It may seem idiotic to open the city gates -

313
00:35:48.840 --> 00:35:52.840
- But Kristina has negotiated a really good amnesty.

314
00:35:53.000 --> 00:35:58.080
No one should be punished.
 Everyone who has resisted should keep their goods.

315
00:35:58.240 --> 00:36:03.480
Kristina has large goods in Sweden and Finland, which she is promised to keep.

316
00:36:09.960 --> 00:36:13.640
We are at Stortorget in the Old Town.

317
00:36:13.800 --> 00:36:18.160
People are on their way to work and tourists try Swedish coffee.

318
00:36:18.320 --> 00:36:23.480
But it was not 500 years ago so calm and quiet.

319
00:36:23.640 --> 00:36:26.880
Because when Kristina gives up the defense of Stockholm -

320
00:36:27.040 --> 00:36:30.640
–And opens the city's gates for Danish King Kristian -

321
00:36:30.800 --> 00:36:35.160
- So one of the most brutal events in Swedish history begins.

322
00:36:35.320 --> 00:36:40.400
And it takes place right here.
 Stockholm's blood bath.

323
00:36:48.640 --> 00:36:53.640
It all begins with Kristian being crowned King, even over Sweden.

324
00:36:53.800 --> 00:36:59.960
The fine noble families and the men of the church are invited to a large coronation party.

325
00:37:00.120 --> 00:37:05.640
Initially, the coronation and the big party go just as planned.

326
00:37:05.800 --> 00:37:11.760
Old enemies and allies meet, and the king is in a brilliant mood.

327
00:37:11.920 --> 00:37:14.920
But then everything turns.

328
00:37:20.600 --> 00:37:25.200
On the third day of the coronation party, King Kristian locks the gates to the party.

329
00:37:25.360 --> 00:37:27.720
No one comes out.

330
00:37:27.880 --> 00:37:34.920
Archbishop Trolle is now accusing the king's former opponent of heresy.

331
00:37:35.080 --> 00:37:37.960
It changes the whole situation.

332
00:37:38.120 --> 00:37:42.920
The amnesty they have just received from the king suddenly no longer applies.

333
00:37:46.280 --> 00:37:51.200
Heresy is a crime against the teachings of the church, that one deviates from the norm -

334
00:37:51.360 --> 00:37:56.760
- or physically attack the church.
 Only the church can decide what is heretics -

335
00:37:56.920 --> 00:38:01.480
- As it is a crime against God, and that is punished with death.

336
00:38:01.640 --> 00:38:05.640
A heretical king cannot withdraw a worldly king.

337
00:38:05.800 --> 00:38:09.880
In this way, the heretics do at Stockholm's carnage - do

338
00:38:10.040 --> 00:38:16.120
- The amnesty no longer applies.
 It has become meaningless.

339
00:38:23.880 --> 00:38:26.920
Kristian does not oppose the chain of the chain.

340
00:38:27.080 --> 00:38:30.240
Instead, he lets the executions.

341
00:38:30.400 --> 00:38:34.840
These are terrible scenes that take place here on Stortorget -

342
00:38:35.000 --> 00:38:38.880
- During some dark days in November 1520.

343
00:38:56.120 --> 00:39:01.280
The designated heretics are hung or beheaded with ax or sword.

344
00:39:01.440 --> 00:39:07.480
Over 100 men are executed and burned during these days.

345
00:39:13.840 --> 00:39:17.840
It is difficult to know why the carnage became so extensive.

346
00:39:18.000 --> 00:39:21.800
King Kristian had his reasons for a political cleansing -

347
00:39:21.960 --> 00:39:27.360
- But you have speculated on Archbishop Trolle and King Kristian -

348
00:39:27.520 --> 00:39:31.080
- Howed up in advance about the charteridom.

349
00:39:31.240 --> 00:39:33.920
In that case, it would explain:

350
00:39:34.080 --> 00:39:40.200
The events on Stortorget were completely in line with what the king actually wanted.

351
00:39:45.080 --> 00:39:51.440
Now much of the political resistance to King Kristian is gone.

352
00:39:51.600 --> 00:39:57.520
Two who can get away with the blood bath are Gustav Eriksson and Hemming Gadh.

353
00:40:05.440 --> 00:40:10.520
Kristian II sends Hemming Gadh to Finland before the carnage.

354
00:40:10.680 --> 00:40:14.680
The idea is that Hemming will persuade the Union opponents in Finland -

355
00:40:14.840 --> 00:40:18.160
- To stand on the king's side.

356
00:40:18.320 --> 00:40:21.600
But Kristian does not trust Hemming.

357
00:40:21.760 --> 00:40:27.200
Instead, he makes sure that Hemming is executed when he comes to Finland.

358
00:40:29.800 --> 00:40:32.800
Gustav Eriksson had learned the homework -

359
00:40:32.960 --> 00:40:37.560
- Then he was captured by Kristian a few years earlier.

360
00:40:39.360 --> 00:40:45.120
So when Gustav was invited to Kristian's coronation, he chose to fail.

361
00:40:52.360 --> 00:40:57.800
Gustav hides during the carnage, but his family and relatives -

362
00:40:57.960 --> 00:41:03.560
--Åker to Stockholm to participate in the festivities.

363
00:41:09.920 --> 00:41:13.920
Stockholm's carnage affects Gustav most personally.

364
00:41:14.080 --> 00:41:17.800
His father and several other relatives are beheaded.

365
00:41:17.960 --> 00:41:23.560
His mother and three sisters are thrown in prison in Denmark.

366
00:41:23.720 --> 00:41:27.720
When Gustav finds out that Danish jacks are looking for him -

367
00:41:27.880 --> 00:41:31.040
- He escapes to Dalarna.

368
00:41:32.880 --> 00:41:38.600
The purpose is to bring the dale men in a rebellion against the Danish royal power.

369
00:41:39.520 --> 00:41:42.680
At the same time as Gustav seeks support in Dalarna -

370
00:41:42.840 --> 00:41:46.560
- Kristian takes home to Denmark from Stockholm.

371
00:41:46.720 --> 00:41:51.400
On the way through Sweden, he executes even more opponents -

372
00:41:51.560 --> 00:41:54.560
- In even more carnage.

373
00:41:54.720 --> 00:41:59.200
When Kristian's men let drinking several monks at Nydala Monastery -

374
00:41:59.360 --> 00:42:02.920
- He is given the nickname "tyrant".

375
00:42:04.280 --> 00:42:08.680
Kristian II makes several mistakes when he takes power after the carnage.

376
00:42:08.840 --> 00:42:14.160
He raises taxes, leaves the country and tries to disarm the farmers.

377
00:42:14.320 --> 00:42:18.320
But the farmers want to be armed, so they rebel.

378
00:42:20.920 --> 00:42:26.200
Together with Gustav now rises to King Kristian.

379
00:42:26.360 --> 00:42:30.560
Now the farmers in Småland are also joining the uprising.

380
00:42:30.720 --> 00:42:35.080
And the leader of the fight becomes Gustav Vasa.

381
00:42:39.680 --> 00:42:45.120
But some castles and castles are difficult to conquer for the peasant soldiers.

382
00:42:48.760 --> 00:42:53.800
To succeed, mercenaries and a fleet are required.

383
00:42:54.960 --> 00:42:58.720
So Gustav turns to the Germans.

384
00:43:01.880 --> 00:43:05.080
Gustav Vasa borrows money from Lübeck -

385
00:43:05.240 --> 00:43:09.480
–And when Lübeck sees that he is about to succeed with his business -

386
00:43:09.640 --> 00:43:15.960
- So they send military reinforcement, a whole army that helps him.

387
00:43:21.680 --> 00:43:27.960
But the help is not free.
 Gustav puts in debt to Lübeck.

388
00:43:28.120 --> 00:43:33.160
Gustav's army eventually wins the war, and he is elected to King Gustav -

389
00:43:33.320 --> 00:43:38.800
- The first of the Vaasa family, June 6, 1523.

390
00:43:38.960 --> 00:43:45.080
And that means the definitive end for the Kalmar Union.

391
00:43:55.720 --> 00:43:59.240
Gustav is chosen as king has several reasons.

392
00:43:59.400 --> 00:44:05.000
He has the right background, and above all, almost all competition is gone.

393
00:44:05.160 --> 00:44:10.960
All heads for the large nobles are beheaded in the carnage.

394
00:44:28.760 --> 00:44:33.640
When Gustav is elected king, a new chapter begins in Sweden's history.

395
00:44:33.800 --> 00:44:39.000
So Gustav sees it, and he affects how the story of him is written.

396
00:44:39.160 --> 00:44:43.400
Gustav builds up the image of himself as the rescuer of the Swedish people -

397
00:44:43.560 --> 00:44:48.960
- And convinces many generations that this was really the case.

398
00:44:52.480 --> 00:44:57.880
Again and again he has been depicted as Sweden's country father.

399
00:44:58.040 --> 00:45:02.360
The most grand statue is here at the Nordic Museum.

400
00:45:04.560 --> 00:45:08.400
But the road to country father gets crooked.

401
00:45:08.560 --> 00:45:12.440
When he takes power, he is a very poor king.

402
00:45:12.600 --> 00:45:18.560
The help he received from Lübeck was expensive, and now they demand the money back.

403
00:45:18.720 --> 00:45:24.320
But Gustav is not the one who pays for himself.
 The Swedish people will do that.

404
00:45:25.480 --> 00:45:32.440
Dalkarls who helped Gustav Vasa reacted negatively to the Posters -

405
00:45:32.600 --> 00:45:36.760
- And pretty soon they rebelled against him.

406
00:45:41.240 --> 00:45:47.560
Gustav tries hard -handed to beat down the uprising, but the Dalfolk does not give up -

407
00:45:47.720 --> 00:45:52.720
- And the deeply indebted king is starting to have serious problems.

408
00:45:55.440 --> 00:46:02.000
But something has recently happened in Germany, who will play Gustav in his hands.

409
00:46:02.160 --> 00:46:06.840
A few years before Gustav takes power, the German monk has Martin Luther -

410
00:46:07.000 --> 00:46:10.600
- Started protest against the Catholic Pope Church.

411
00:46:11.960 --> 00:46:16.880
A change, or reformation, of the church is underway.

412
00:46:24.560 --> 00:46:28.200
There is a strong criticism of the Catholic Church -

413
00:46:28.360 --> 00:46:31.680
- And how the priesthood behaves throughout Europe.

414
00:46:31.840 --> 00:46:36.720
Many princes now see an opportunity to gain greater power and wealth.

415
00:46:36.880 --> 00:46:41.960
One of them is Gustav Vasa.
 The motives for his part regarding the Reformation -

416
00:46:42.120 --> 00:46:44.960
- Is probably largely economic.

417
00:46:50.000 --> 00:46:54.880
The Catholic Church in Sweden will become a Swedish church.

418
00:46:55.040 --> 00:47:00.200
The pope is no longer the highest hen.
 The king should be.

419
00:47:00.360 --> 00:47:03.680
King Gustav.

420
00:47:03.840 --> 00:47:07.080
All this is usually called Västerås recess.

421
00:47:07.240 --> 00:47:11.640
The krona strengthens its finances by seizing the church's properties.

422
00:47:11.800 --> 00:47:16.960
The bishops lose their power, and their military followers are reduced.

423
00:47:17.120 --> 00:47:22.520
The monasteries are closed and the nobility regains their goods which they donated to the church.

424
00:47:22.680 --> 00:47:28.560
So the winners of this reform package are the king and the nobility.

425
00:47:28.720 --> 00:47:34.720
When the church's land and properties change owners, the king's economy is improved.

426
00:47:34.880 --> 00:47:39.400
With money in the pocket, Gustav Vasa manages to beat down the uprising in Dalarna -

427
00:47:39.560 --> 00:47:42.960
- So the men are forced to give up.

428
00:47:44.000 --> 00:47:48.000
Gustav is not content to take control of the church's properties.

429
00:47:48.160 --> 00:47:52.160
He also wants to take control of the language of the church:

430
00:47:52.320 --> 00:47:56.880
The Bible should be translated into a language that the people understand, ie.
 Swedish.

431
00:47:58.760 --> 00:48:04.400
The New Testament is printed in Swedish three years after Gustav was selected as king.

432
00:48:04.560 --> 00:48:09.520
Then it is decided that the fair in the churches should also be held in Swedish.

433
00:48:09.680 --> 00:48:13.160
The Old Testament is also translated over time.

434
00:48:13.320 --> 00:48:17.760
Gustav Vasa's Bible is the first Bible in Swedish.

435
00:48:17.920 --> 00:48:21.520
During this time, bibles are printed in the vernacular.

436
00:48:21.680 --> 00:48:26.800
Gustav Vasa wanted to show that his vernacular, ie the Swedish - -

437
00:48:26.960 --> 00:48:31.520
- Can be used for religion, not just Latin.

438
00:48:33.680 --> 00:48:37.360
You had the idea that it should be a state, a language.

439
00:48:37.520 --> 00:48:42.920
In this way, the Bible is also a means of power, a way to manifest power.

440
00:48:43.080 --> 00:48:48.600
Gustav Vasa's Bible translation is of great importance for the Swedish language.

441
00:48:48.760 --> 00:48:54.640
As the New Testament is spread to all parish churches in Sweden -

442
00:48:54.800 --> 00:49:01.240
–Af the priests get something to relate to spelling -

443
00:49:01.400 --> 00:49:04.960
- And this is the first time this is happening in the Swedish language.

444
00:49:05.120 --> 00:49:08.360
Gustav Vasa's Bible gets an enormous weight-

445
00:49:08.520 --> 00:49:12.720
- For the Swedish writing language norm.

446
00:49:12.880 --> 00:49:19.680
With Vasa's Bible, the bookstores establish itself, Ä and Ö in our alphabet.

447
00:49:24.640 --> 00:49:29.600
But Gustav Vasa is mainly interested in strengthening the royal power.

448
00:49:29.760 --> 00:49:35.360
He puts a lot of effort into building the Swedish state apparatus.

449
00:49:37.120 --> 00:49:41.160
Gustav centralizes the kingdom.
 He builds up a bailiff -

450
00:49:41.320 --> 00:49:46.720
- And is in constant connection with the bailiffs.
 They write to each other.

451
00:49:46.880 --> 00:49:52.280
The bailiffs are liable to account, so they have to go to the Royal Palace -

452
00:49:52.440 --> 00:49:55.800
- To the counting chamber, and report their accounts.

453
00:49:55.960 --> 00:50:02.440
This is the first phase of Sweden's state formation process in the 16th century.

454
00:50:04.200 --> 00:50:08.000
But outside the country, the changes are not appreciated -

455
00:50:08.160 --> 00:50:13.560
- And the nitic bailiffs that demand the people on their properties.

456
00:50:14.800 --> 00:50:17.800
Especially not in Småland.

457
00:50:17.960 --> 00:50:21.560
There, a man rises to the king's bailiffs.

458
00:50:23.040 --> 00:50:25.880
Nils Dacke has had enough.

459
00:50:28.640 --> 00:50:35.080
When Nils Dacke kills Gustav Vasa's bailiffs, a rebellion begins in Småland.

460
00:50:35.240 --> 00:50:37.880
Dacke feud.

461
00:50:42.480 --> 00:50:46.280
We are now in the early 1540s.

462
00:50:46.440 --> 00:50:49.720
For many, Nils Dacke is a rebel leader -

463
00:50:49.880 --> 00:50:56.000
- But according to Gustav Vasa, he is a whore man, traitor and heretic.

464
00:50:56.160 --> 00:50:59.880
Gustav Vasa uses propaganda against Dacke and his men.

465
00:51:00.040 --> 00:51:04.680
He calls them Småland forest thieves, to reduce them -

466
00:51:04.840 --> 00:51:08.880
-And pretending that there is a small local problem in Småland -

467
00:51:09.040 --> 00:51:12.560
- While the dissatisfaction is in fact widespread throughout the country.

468
00:51:15.120 --> 00:51:18.080
But Nils Dacke is not a forest thief -

469
00:51:18.240 --> 00:51:22.600
–On a Småland farmer who lives with his wife Elin and their son -

470
00:51:22.760 --> 00:51:26.520
- In the yard Flaka in southern Småland.

471
00:51:27.920 --> 00:51:31.600
Life in Småland at this time is poor.

472
00:51:31.760 --> 00:51:35.760
But people are used to taking care of themselves and deciding on their lives.

473
00:51:35.920 --> 00:51:40.200
They don't want anyone to change that.
 Not even the king.

474
00:51:43.800 --> 00:51:47.840
There are several things that make the dacke uprising flare up.

475
00:51:48.000 --> 00:51:53.560
Not just new taxes should be paid.
 Now that the king is the high leader of the church -

476
00:51:53.720 --> 00:51:59.960
- He begins to empty the churches on rime judges, to replenish the Treasury.

477
00:52:01.400 --> 00:52:06.800
The jacks who collect church silver end up on a collision course with the people.

478
00:52:06.960 --> 00:52:09.960
For in the churches, among the church silver -

479
00:52:10.120 --> 00:52:14.960
- There is the object that the people themselves have paid, such as bridal crowns.

480
00:52:15.120 --> 00:52:19.960
And they would like to see their daughters carry bridal crown as they get married.

481
00:52:20.120 --> 00:52:25.040
They do not understand why the king collects such objects and melts them down.

482
00:52:38.880 --> 00:52:44.680
It may not be so strange that people get angry and want to strike back.

483
00:52:48.160 --> 00:52:53.160
The strange thing is that an ordinary farmer leads the uprising.

484
00:52:58.200 --> 00:53:02.880
Nils Dacke is against the king's new requirements and increased control.

485
00:53:03.040 --> 00:53:06.560
He wants it as it used to be.

486
00:53:18.120 --> 00:53:20.920
Dacke's rebellion spreads -

487
00:53:21.080 --> 00:53:26.400
- And Gustav's jacks is an easy prey for Dacke's men in the loud forests.

488
00:53:29.520 --> 00:53:35.920
Soon Gustav Vasa realizes that the uprising is starting to become a serious problem.

489
00:53:39.840 --> 00:53:43.000
The king then withdraws his troops -

490
00:53:43.160 --> 00:53:46.880
- And signs a ceasefire with Nils Dacke.

491
00:53:48.040 --> 00:53:53.400
But peace is not long lasting.
 The king strikes back with full force -

492
00:53:53.560 --> 00:53:58.560
- And his men finally manage to get Nils Dacke, and kill him.

493
00:53:58.720 --> 00:54:04.520
Gustav Vasa is very ruthless and is looking for Nils Dacke's relatives.

494
00:54:04.680 --> 00:54:10.560
He executes many, such as Dacke's mother and others who have been in contact with him.

495
00:54:10.720 --> 00:54:16.560
He does not want an uprising atmosphere in Småland, which risks blossoming.

496
00:54:23.280 --> 00:54:28.080
Gustav Vasa lets Nils Dacke's head on a pile at Kalmar Castle.

497
00:54:28.240 --> 00:54:32.960
A warning of how things are going for anyone who sits up against King Gustav.

498
00:54:33.120 --> 00:54:36.040
A crown of copper was put on the head-

499
00:54:36.200 --> 00:54:41.600
- To show that Nils Dacke was a rebel and false leader.

500
00:54:48.720 --> 00:54:53.720
But the Dacke uprising changes King Gustav and Sweden.

501
00:54:53.880 --> 00:54:57.880
Gustav Vasa has so far been quite burdus in his politics.

502
00:54:58.040 --> 00:55:03.640
He has often just pushed through things and ignored what people thought.

503
00:55:03.800 --> 00:55:08.800
Nowadays you see him go around.
 He tries to read the situation.

504
00:55:08.960 --> 00:55:13.960
He makes more successive changes, and even
 the return.

505
00:55:14.120 --> 00:55:20.120
He tries more to gain popularity in the people, after the Dacke feud.

506
00:55:50.080 --> 00:55:54.560
Gustav Vasa is dead.
 He has ruled Sweden for 40 years -

507
00:55:54.720 --> 00:55:58.840
- And managed to create order and stability in the kingdom.

508
00:55:59.000 --> 00:56:02.600
The situation in Sweden is far from the uncertainty that prevailed -

509
00:56:02.760 --> 00:56:06.920
-After the pest's ravages in the late 1300s.

510
00:56:16.280 --> 00:56:21.920
It is over to constant rebellion and power struggles between different interests.

511
00:56:22.080 --> 00:56:25.920
The Danish influence over Sweden is over-

512
00:56:26.080 --> 00:56:31.880
- And the country has become independent and united under Gustav Vasa.

513
00:56:37.280 --> 00:56:42.600
He leaves behind a well -organized country.
 It is good finances and filled barns.

514
00:56:42.760 --> 00:56:47.880
There is a lot of silver in the royal tax chamber.
 He has created peace.

515
00:56:48.040 --> 00:56:52.560
It is well functioning to be the 16th century.

516
00:56:52.720 --> 00:56:56.920
Gustav Vasa has been described both as a country father and the dictator.

517
00:56:57.080 --> 00:57:03.920
He was unscrupulous and did not pull for lies, manipulation and violence.

518
00:57:04.080 --> 00:57:09.280
But he was also another.
 In the letters, a person with great humor emerges.

519
00:57:09.440 --> 00:57:15.720
And he was a loving father who was constantly worried about his children.

520
00:57:20.280 --> 00:57:24.320
Gustav's children are gathered around the coffin.

521
00:57:24.480 --> 00:57:28.720
Vasa's body is located in a chamber at Stockholm Castle for eight weeks.

522
00:57:28.880 --> 00:57:31.800
The body is embalmed and he is prepared.

523
00:57:31.960 --> 00:57:37.120
And the director behind all this is Erik.
 Now he has taken over -

524
00:57:37.280 --> 00:57:41.640
- And the other children may adhere to what he says.

525
00:57:41.800 --> 00:57:48.600
Gustav had led the Riksdag to agree to make Sweden an inheritance.

526
00:57:48.760 --> 00:57:55.320
The king should no longer be chosen, but the crown should be inherited from father to son.

527
00:57:55.480 --> 00:58:01.080
And since Erik is the eldest son, it is he who becomes king: Erik XIV.

528
00:58:20.880 --> 00:58:26.520
Gustav will be the first king in Sweden, which is buried here in Uppsala Cathedral.

529
00:58:26.680 --> 00:58:30.840
That he is located here, at the foremost place in the church -

530
00:58:31.000 --> 00:58:36.280
- shows clearly that he won power both across the kingdom and across the church.

531
00:58:38.880 --> 00:58:43.680
After Gustav Vasa's death, a new era begins in our history.

532
00:58:43.840 --> 00:58:49.680
Sweden will be a great power, and the price for it will be high.

533
00:59:12.280 --> 00:59:16.760
