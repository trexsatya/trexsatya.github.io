00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:07.400
In tonight's section of Ifs, quiz about all culture in Sweden:

2
00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:12.280
Our Turkish brother from Jordbro, Big O.

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:15.480
Babylon's emerald, Elaf Ali.

4
00:00:15.640 --> 00:00:18.480
Lustigkurren from Uzbekistan: Ato Karlsson.

5
00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:22.200
The Albanian Bus Rings Queen, Laura Ukaj.

6
00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:25.200
Humor legend from Degeberga Petrina Solange.

00:00:25.360 --> 00:00:29.200
Landskrona's most famous person after Farah Adabi, Filip Dikmen.

00:00:29.360 --> 00:00:31.880
Sweden's most fun Hijab, Kaeli Abdi.

9
00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:35.520
Let half Medina shine: Sami Rekik.

10
00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:41.320
Long as a flagpole, always with Punch Lines in progress, Ahmed Berhan!

11
00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:46.520
Welcome to IFS.
 As on the track, although we just go the blue line.

12
00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:51.800
My name is Ahmed Berhan.
 Here are our asylum seekers, the contestants:

13
00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:54.360
Frida!

14
00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:56.920
Mikaela!

15
00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:59.960
Today he is orange: Mattias!

16
00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:04.520
The quiz goes for this.

17
00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:10.000
You choose a panelist and decide whether what it says is true or false.

18
00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:14.160
Today we start with no less than you, Mikaela.

19
00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:18.720
- What of the panelists do you start with?
 -Oh!
 Filip.

20
00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:21.920
Love, Mikaela.

21
00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:24.920
Good choice.
 - Filip?

22
00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:33.680
I can't do anything, the man.

23
00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:38.160
- It's called Persian.
 –And you ...!

24
00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:43.480
You say parachute jumpers because they appeared from nowhere -

25
00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:48.120
- Set your food ... stingy fucking who has overstayed their Welcome.

26
00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:53.520
They showed up from the sky and robbed our crap.

27
00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:58.280
- So is something bad?
 -Aah.

28
00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:02.400
Well, I'm probably saying it's false.

29
00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:09.360
It sounds like something you have to be strong and good at.
 It does not rhyme.

30
00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:13.960
You think it's false?
 Unfortunately, there will be no point.

31
00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:17.400
-Is it true?
 - Why would I lie to you?

32
00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:20.760
It is a phenomenal expression of a spinner.

33
00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:24.400
Chatrbaaz - when you get an unexpected visit.

34
00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:27.800
Persian culture has the thing with "take, take, take!"

35
00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:31.880
But as soon as you go, you are a fucking chatrbaaz.

36
00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:35.440
"He came here, he took everything."

37
00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:39.000
Mattias, you work as a subway informant.

38
00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:43.840
- Traffic informant in the subway.
 - People recognize your voice.

39
00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:48.080
- You give bad news.
 -Unfortunately.
 Rarely anything positive.

40
00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:51.680
Give examples of how it sounds at work.

41
00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:56.240
"Traffic information for traveling on the subway's red line towards Ropsten."

42
00:02:56.400 --> 00:03:00.440
- "We have a delay ..." - you are, the man!

43
00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:02.440
Yah!

44
00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:07.640
Do me a favor.
 When you go back to work on Monday-

45
00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:10.080
–As the traffic information you should give:

46
00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:16.160
"Now the inspectors are in Gullmarsplan, Akalla and the Western forest."

47
00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:19.400
"I repeat, the controllers are there ..."

48
00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:23.440
- Is it for your sake?
 -It would be appreciated.

49
00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:28.080
- What in the panel are you starting with?
 - Then we take Petrina.

50
00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:39.960
You gather outdoors or adjacent to a mosque.

51
00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:44.160
You beat yourself.
 Some go very long.

52
00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:49.520
They cut themselves with swords and stuff.
 It is so.

53
00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:54.440
It sounds a bit extreme.

54
00:03:55.560 --> 00:04:01.760
-It can not be true.
 False.
 - You don't believe in Petrina's explanation?

55
00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:06.160
Unfortunately.
 There will be no point for you either.

56
00:04:06.320 --> 00:04:09.840
The tradition Ashura takes place once a year.

57
00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:16.600
This is an extreme variant, but it is a real tradition.

58
00:04:16.760 --> 00:04:21.040
- Thanks for your attempt.
 - I've seen it live.

59
00:04:21.200 --> 00:04:26.240
- Mom took me to the mosque.
 - So everyone hit you.

60
00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:32.480
- Frida, do you bring home the first point?
 -Let's hope so.

61
00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:37.080
- Who do you choose to talk to?
 –Alaf.

62
00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:44.200
Bleach.

63
00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:48.560
We in Sweden are happy to drive with "brown without sun" - -

64
00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:52.880
–But they put bleach in their skin creams -

65
00:04:53.040 --> 00:04:57.880
- So they get moisturized and white.
 Win-win.
 Or not.

66
00:05:01.480 --> 00:05:05.480
Elaf really does everything for this citizenship.

67
00:05:05.640 --> 00:05:08.080
Win-win.
 - Frida?

68
00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:13.480
I have heard that it is considered nice to be pale in Asia.

69
00:05:13.640 --> 00:05:16.040
You speak the truth.

70
00:05:16.200 --> 00:05:21.320
You know what?
 Win-win for you.
 Congratulations, you got your first point.

71
00:05:22.520 --> 00:05:27.160
Bleaching creams are a major industry in Asia and other parts of the world.

72
00:05:27.320 --> 00:05:29.400
According to an article from vogue-

73
00:05:29.560 --> 00:05:34.520
- If 2027 comes the white cream industry to be worth around $ 24 billion.

74
00:05:34.680 --> 00:05:38.440
POFF!
 So much white cream and not a single white face.

75
00:05:38.600 --> 00:05:41.320
Michael Jackson.

76
00:05:43.080 --> 00:05:46.680
- Mikaela?
 -Yes.
 Then I drive at Big O.

77
00:05:46.840 --> 00:05:49.720
- Big o?
 - Ha, Brakam?

78
00:05:49.880 --> 00:05:54.400
The symbol is found in both the Jewish and the Muslim world.

79
00:05:55.560 --> 00:05:57.840
It's mum's ear files.

80
00:05:59.320 --> 00:06:01.280
No.

81
00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:08.040
No its true.
 This means that mom sees you.

82
00:06:08.200 --> 00:06:12.800
Brother, I'm 32 years old.
 Still I get ear files from mom.

83
00:06:12.960 --> 00:06:17.920
The eye in the middle means that mom sees you wherever you go.
 So sharpen yourself!

84
00:06:18.080 --> 00:06:22.120
The brother, you can sit in Amsterdam in a coffee shop and kickish a fat.

85
00:06:22.280 --> 00:06:26.400
So comes the hand from nowhere and ... Yoop-Schlap!

86
00:06:35.200 --> 00:06:39.640
That it is the mother's eye does not sound reasonable.

87
00:06:39.800 --> 00:06:43.000
Only why it is certainly true.

88
00:06:43.160 --> 00:06:49.040
An eye, it looks like tears ... just the mother's eye?
 No no.

89
00:06:49.200 --> 00:06:52.840
- I think you are lying.
 - Strange voice: Aha.

90
00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:58.200
- You think Big o is lying to you?
 -At least a little bit.

91
00:06:58.360 --> 00:07:04.160
Are you mom?
 Your eye is strong.
 Congratulations, you got your first point.

92
00:07:05.560 --> 00:07:08.680
Brother ... Sami, show, show!

93
00:07:08.840 --> 00:07:14.240
It was a hand with an eye in the middle.
 Muslims call it Fatima's hand.

94
00:07:14.400 --> 00:07:17.400
In Judaism, it is called Miriam's hand.

95
00:07:17.560 --> 00:07:21.880
It symbolizes divine protection against evil and is considered to be lucky.

96
00:07:22.040 --> 00:07:26.560
Ahmed, I've had mom and ear files with me for a while.

97
00:07:26.720 --> 00:07:29.920
-It is here.
 - Najs!

98
00:07:30.080 --> 00:07:34.160
- damn.
 - Many Muslims who now only: "Haram!"

99
00:07:34.320 --> 00:07:39.840
Congratulations, Mikaela.
 - Mattias, should we try to jump into the scoreboard?

100
00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:43.640
- What do you choose?
 --Laura.

101
00:07:43.800 --> 00:07:46.920
In the Middle East, Shahahata is an obvious part of childhood.

102
00:07:49.160 --> 00:07:53.960
A baby oil soaked with garlic that you lubricate and out of the kids.

103
00:07:54.120 --> 00:07:59.800
This is done to keep the spirits away from them, protect them from the spirits.

104
00:07:59.960 --> 00:08:02.720
You laugh.
 All of us are protected here.

105
00:08:05.920 --> 00:08:09.360
I have not received that protection.

106
00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:13.920
-It shows.
 - You looked around before you said it.

107
00:08:14.080 --> 00:08:17.720
- "I'm not protected."
 -Alone.

108
00:08:17.880 --> 00:08:22.360
It feels like it could be true.

109
00:08:22.520 --> 00:08:27.040
- You probably wouldn't lie to me.
 - The man, she is Alban.

110
00:08:27.200 --> 00:08:32.360
- Broke, don't try!
 - I think that's right.

111
00:08:32.520 --> 00:08:35.680
You choose to trust Laura?

112
00:08:35.840 --> 00:08:42.160
Shahahata is a baby oil with garlic odor to protect against ghosts?

113
00:08:42.320 --> 00:08:46.520
- It sounds ... - it's false.

114
00:08:46.680 --> 00:08:51.800
You would have listened to Filip.
 I'm Alban, the man.

115
00:08:51.960 --> 00:08:54.320
Shahahata means slipper.

116
00:08:54.480 --> 00:08:59.720
We are honest.
 When you get beaten with a slipper - still a good day.

117
00:08:59.880 --> 00:09:04.000
- It's every day.
 - There are alternatives.
 - Frida?

118
00:09:04.160 --> 00:09:08.800
I say this: Take back the 90's.
 Sami.

119
00:09:11.320 --> 00:09:14.760
- Sami, time for a video question.
 -It's time.

120
00:09:14.920 --> 00:09:19.400
This is show dance, and what a damn show it was.

121
00:09:19.560 --> 00:09:24.920
I was honored to work with you last week and learned the word "Naknemo".

122
00:09:28.560 --> 00:09:33.480
Dermot had behind the back of anise learned some Arabic words -

123
00:09:33.640 --> 00:09:39.000
- To pay tribute to him in live broadcast, because Anis's father is Arab.

124
00:09:39.160 --> 00:09:44.400
So the word means "dancing angel" in Arabic.

125
00:09:44.560 --> 00:09:49.240
Would he have reacted like that?
 I think you lie to me.

126
00:09:49.400 --> 00:09:53.360
His reaction would not have become it, if it meant that.

127
00:09:53.520 --> 00:09:58.280
I think it must have been a little more naughty maybe.

128
00:09:58.440 --> 00:10:00.960
- Naughty?
 -Yes.

129
00:10:01.120 --> 00:10:03.840
- So it's false?
 -Just.

130
00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:08.120
Congratulations, Frida.
 You've got one more point.

131
00:10:10.800 --> 00:10:14.560
Naknemo is Syrian.

132
00:10:14.720 --> 00:10:17.920
Filip, do you want to tell me what that means?

133
00:10:18.080 --> 00:10:22.080
Nakno means "I fuck", emo means "mom".

134
00:10:22.240 --> 00:10:26.960
-Is it true?!
 Did he say that on TV?
 -Sick!

135
00:10:27.120 --> 00:10:30.920
I can't believe that you record a program and say Naknemo.

136
00:10:31.080 --> 00:10:33.800
Check out the camera and say it again.

137
00:10:33.960 --> 00:10:36.520
- Mikaela?
 - I drive on Kaeli.

138
00:10:36.680 --> 00:10:39.040
Yes, Ahmed.

139
00:10:43.840 --> 00:10:48.280
Norwegians.
 Epafolket, Raggardunk ...

140
00:10:48.440 --> 00:10:54.080
- Oh, Raggardunk!
 - Kaeli, what is the real answer?

141
00:10:55.120 --> 00:10:59.680
Finds actually.
 It's Finnish and means "my friend".

142
00:10:59.840 --> 00:11:04.000
"Moi, Moi, Warya!"
 - Should I show?

143
00:11:04.160 --> 00:11:07.200
Moi, Moi, Warya.

144
00:11:07.360 --> 00:11:11.600
-Yes.
 Moi, moi?
 -No.
 Warya.

145
00:11:11.760 --> 00:11:15.640
- I might not say it right.
 - Moi, Moi means "Hello, Hello".

146
00:11:15.800 --> 00:11:21.280
-Yes it's true.
 - You trust Kaeli.
 You believe it?

147
00:11:21.440 --> 00:11:27.120
That Warya is Finnish?
 It really isn't, Mikaela!

148
00:11:29.600 --> 00:11:35.400
It sounded so.
 You first cheated me with Norrland and then Finland.

149
00:11:35.560 --> 00:11:40.560
Warya is Somali and is used when shouting on someone, like "Listen!"

150
00:11:40.720 --> 00:11:42.720
–Warya, Warya!
 –Mattias go to work tomorrow:

151
00:11:42.880 --> 00:11:48.920
"Warya, that's problem. Inshallah, Fatima's hand looks at all of us."

152
00:11:49.080 --> 00:11:53.400
"Traffic is back in 5 minutes."
 - Mattias, now we drive.

153
00:11:53.560 --> 00:11:58.280
- I welcome Ato in the game.
 -Thanks so much.

154
00:11:58.440 --> 00:12:03.120
We know of Gammelsvenskbyn in Ukraine with many Swedish kittens.

155
00:12:03.280 --> 00:12:07.200
Also in Japan there is Sweden Hills.

156
00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:14.960
An ambassador was visiting there.
 He commented that it was similar to Sweden.

157
00:12:15.120 --> 00:12:18.040
To pay tribute to him they created a village -

158
00:12:18.200 --> 00:12:23.600
- There they celebrate Swedish traditions such as midsummer and cancerous disc.

159
00:12:23.760 --> 00:12:28.520
It could do Japanese because they are polite -

160
00:12:28.680 --> 00:12:33.880
- But I still don't think they pulled it that far.

161
00:12:34.040 --> 00:12:40.840
- I think you get untrue.
 -Okay, Mattias.
 Then I know it.

162
00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:45.120
You do not think there is a place called Sweden Hills.

163
00:12:45.280 --> 00:12:48.600
-No.
 - You should have done that.

164
00:12:48.760 --> 00:12:51.640
- Unfortunately, that's true.
 -I told you.

165
00:12:51.800 --> 00:12:56.600
The first shovel was taken in 1984. It looks like a village in Dalarna -

166
00:12:56.760 --> 00:13:00.880
- And you adopt the Swedish lifestyle.

167
00:13:01.040 --> 00:13:06.760
- You got a reversed full pot.
 - Something should get it, in some way.

168
00:13:06.920 --> 00:13:12.120
We will see who wins the round.
 - Frida, you have a question left.

169
00:13:12.280 --> 00:13:15.560
As you notice, all panelists are already selected.

170
00:13:15.720 --> 00:13:20.640
This means that your last question and your last panelist will be ...

171
00:13:25.440 --> 00:13:28.280
/Cheer and applause/

172
00:13:28.440 --> 00:13:33.720
It's like when I leave Kastrup.
 Always randomly selected.

173
00:13:33.880 --> 00:13:37.200
But now you don't have to undress.

174
00:13:37.360 --> 00:13:40.680
Frida, you can get a full pot if you answer correctly.

175
00:13:40.840 --> 00:13:46.320
-It would be nice.
 - Giant.
 It would be.

176
00:13:46.480 --> 00:13:48.200
Pertrina?

177
00:13:53.120 --> 00:13:58.360
That's what Ebba Busch screams every time she comes.

178
00:14:03.040 --> 00:14:09.920
Wasn't it a reporter on the evening leaf who pretended to buy a home?

179
00:14:10.080 --> 00:14:15.360
So he asked the broker, "Does there live some Arabs here?"

180
00:14:15.520 --> 00:14:21.720
The broker must have replied: "There are no Arabs, just ..." that quote.

181
00:14:21.880 --> 00:14:25.880
- Have you been looking for a home in Malmö?
 -No, I have not done that.

182
00:14:26.040 --> 00:14:31.840
That sounds totally sick, but just because it is certainly true.

183
00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:38.240
You believe in Petrina and have received another point.
 You got a full pot.

184
00:14:40.240 --> 00:14:46.040
Malmö is a place where Arabs are included as a variable in the housing search.

185
00:14:46.200 --> 00:14:51.160
- Malmö represented.
 - The one who applied for was Elaf actually.

186
00:14:51.320 --> 00:14:55.520
--Wow!
 - We have rounded off the first round.

187
00:14:55.680 --> 00:14:59.800
Mattias, unfortunately no final.
 Thank you for joining.

188
00:14:59.960 --> 00:15:05.080
A large applause to Frida and Mikaela who have moved on to the final!

189
00:15:09.160 --> 00:15:14.480
Najs.
 This round is about coming first to 5 points.

190
00:15:14.640 --> 00:15:19.640
What is different is that if you answer the wrong, the score goes to the opponent.

191
00:15:19.800 --> 00:15:24.800
Frida, you combed home full pot and may inaugurate the final round.

192
00:15:24.960 --> 00:15:27.880
- Who do you choose to shake hands with?
 --Ato.

193
00:15:28.040 --> 00:15:30.440
-Yey!
 -Hello!

194
00:15:30.600 --> 00:15:35.720
- I said "Ey".
 - Do we get like this on TV, right?

195
00:15:35.880 --> 00:15:39.720
Kaeli, do you think you are with the gynecologist?

196
00:15:40.840 --> 00:15:45.360
- It's so uncomfortable down here.
 -Oton, time for a video question.

197
00:15:45.520 --> 00:15:49.440
/Whistling cars and shots/

198
00:15:52.840 --> 00:15:58.480
- What did we see in the video?
 - An ordinary Monday night in Malmö.

199
00:15:58.640 --> 00:16:04.280
Brother, don't talk shit about Malmö.
 That is a regular wedding day.

200
00:16:04.440 --> 00:16:10.520
They celebrate love by shooting some pang-pang.
 It's a nice thing.

201
00:16:10.680 --> 00:16:14.680
Apart from the shooting, it sounds extremely-

202
00:16:14.840 --> 00:16:19.720
- I think it seemed to be some kind of celebration.
 But shoot?

203
00:16:19.880 --> 00:16:24.640
-Yes.
 That's how you show love.
 - It sounded like high bangs.

204
00:16:24.800 --> 00:16:28.720
Cute that you call it firecrackers.
 It's true.

205
00:16:28.880 --> 00:16:34.160
- Congratulations, Mikaela.
 You got a point.
 - Frida, I always speak the truth.

206
00:16:34.320 --> 00:16:39.440
It was Eskilstuna in November 2022 when celebrating a wedding.

207
00:16:39.600 --> 00:16:45.880
You shot some shots.
 It is difficult to find fireworks in November.

208
00:16:46.040 --> 00:16:51.280
- Mitt and Filip's wedding.
 -I'd rather die.

209
00:16:52.840 --> 00:16:56.920
The first time you see someone throwing yourself after the bullets.

210
00:16:57.080 --> 00:17:01.520
- Catch as a goalkeeper.
 - Mikaela, congratulations.

211
00:17:01.680 --> 00:17:07.360
- Should we see if you get a point yourself?
 -I'll try.
 I'll probably take ...

212
00:17:07.520 --> 00:17:10.080
- Petrina.
 - Petrina?

213
00:17:10.240 --> 00:17:16.040
The king was criticized for what he said about the throne when Victoria will take over.

214
00:17:16.200 --> 00:17:19.000
Another classic royagoof is:

215
00:17:23.560 --> 00:17:28.800
Because he can't read.
 He just turns leaves all the time.

216
00:17:28.960 --> 00:17:31.800
He is looking for the pictures.

217
00:17:33.040 --> 00:17:36.680
It was well that he was criticized -

218
00:17:36.840 --> 00:17:43.920
- For he praised the dictator in Brunei for his fine relationship with the people.

219
00:17:44.080 --> 00:17:49.120
Then the people felt: "He is a dictator, we have no nice relationship."

220
00:17:49.280 --> 00:17:51.720
Mikaela, what do you say?

221
00:17:51.880 --> 00:17:56.720
I know he apologized for what he said about Brunei.

222
00:17:56.880 --> 00:18:03.160
But this was about a slant as it is said that he may have done.

223
00:18:03.320 --> 00:18:08.080
- Oh, what diplomatically expressed.
 - I got careful here.

224
00:18:08.240 --> 00:18:12.040
I say it's false.

225
00:18:12.200 --> 00:18:17.840
You do that right in. Congratulations, you've got one more point!

226
00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:21.080
A gear.
 Brunei was one of the king's bloopers.

227
00:18:21.240 --> 00:18:27.040
Here, questions were made about the king and his friends' sexy party habits.

228
00:18:27.200 --> 00:18:30.960
- Frida?
 - I choose Laura.

229
00:18:34.840 --> 00:18:40.720
A picture of Albanian Airlines and that is our flight attendant.
 Okay.

230
00:18:43.800 --> 00:18:48.520
It is a traditional attire that is used for weddings.

231
00:18:48.680 --> 00:18:53.920
But you can only have it when you are married.

232
00:18:54.080 --> 00:18:56.440
That was difficult.

233
00:18:56.600 --> 00:19:01.600
It is very nice, but you can only have it when you are married ...?

234
00:19:01.760 --> 00:19:05.920
-Sure, why not?
 It's true.
 - You believe in Laura?

235
00:19:06.080 --> 00:19:08.440
-Point!
 -Thanks.

236
00:19:10.600 --> 00:19:14.440
What Laura said is true.
 The suit can be seen at Albanian weddings.

237
00:19:14.600 --> 00:19:19.720
It is called Dimija or Dallama.
 Only married women are allowed to carry it.

238
00:19:19.880 --> 00:19:25.240
I want to go to an Albanian wedding where people dress like Power Rangers.

239
00:19:25.400 --> 00:19:30.400
Is it common?
 If you go to every Albanian wedding, do you see that suit?

240
00:19:30.560 --> 00:19:34.720
Very popular 2023. But if you see me in such a ...

241
00:19:34.880 --> 00:19:37.600
First I die before I wear it.

242
00:19:37.760 --> 00:19:42.400
I thought Albanian wedding suit was Adidas three lines.

243
00:19:42.560 --> 00:19:47.240
- We do that after work, the man.
 –SHOTS FIRED!

244
00:19:48.520 --> 00:19:51.680
Mikaela, your turn to shine.

245
00:19:51.840 --> 00:19:57.240
- Then I take Filip.
 - Hello, Darling!
 Have you missed me?

246
00:19:59.520 --> 00:20:01.080
Filip?

247
00:20:05.040 --> 00:20:10.000
They promised to open an old, classic nightclub in Sundbyberg.

248
00:20:10.160 --> 00:20:12.920
A local club, previously closed.

249
00:20:13.080 --> 00:20:18.720
They promised to open it with the guarantee that it was run under ethnic Swedish.

250
00:20:20.960 --> 00:20:26.320
It sounds crazy, but now I will think of a club that lay there.

251
00:20:26.480 --> 00:20:29.760
–And that ... —Mannen, you have lived.

252
00:20:31.600 --> 00:20:36.640
It can be so sick that they go out and say something like that.

253
00:20:36.800 --> 00:20:41.600
- Did you have fun at that club?
 - I don't even remember what it's called.

254
00:20:41.760 --> 00:20:44.760
- Garbo?
 -Exactly!

255
00:20:44.920 --> 00:20:49.560
–Ahmed has also been there.
 - We don't have to talk about it.

256
00:20:49.720 --> 00:20:54.160
- Do you believe to believe ...?
 - We might be there at the same time.

257
00:20:54.320 --> 00:20:59.360
- We might be ... - a printer!

258
00:21:00.560 --> 00:21:05.920
- Hed is married.
 - You choose to believe in Filip?

259
00:21:06.080 --> 00:21:11.240
- Unfortunately, there will be no points for you.
 -Lucky.
 Im happy for that.

260
00:21:11.400 --> 00:21:15.960
- It was so sick.
 - Congratulations, Frida.
 You got a point.

261
00:21:16.120 --> 00:21:20.400
SD works specifically, but they did not want to open a club.

262
00:21:20.560 --> 00:21:25.640
They wanted to demolish the new bridge between the marsh and Rinkeby.
 !
 - Frida?

263
00:21:25.800 --> 00:21:29.440
- What do you choose?
 - I choose Big O.

264
00:21:29.600 --> 00:21:33.640
October 2022, a school was reported in Upplands Väsby.

265
00:21:38.360 --> 00:21:43.520
The students were not allowed to smoke Äzi in the classroom.

266
00:21:52.720 --> 00:21:57.960
The name, it was a teacher who during a geography lesson -

267
00:21:58.120 --> 00:22:04.520
- Said that Kurdistan does not exist.
 I also want yeah shono, but ...

268
00:22:04.680 --> 00:22:09.080
The students forward it to their pears.

269
00:22:09.240 --> 00:22:15.600
Then it became Chorba outside the school.
 Chorba, soup, yes.

270
00:22:18.640 --> 00:22:21.120
- She will have a hard time with that.
 - Does that let go of reasonable?

271
00:22:21.280 --> 00:22:26.920
- Yes, strangely enough.
 - Frida does not admit Kurdistan.

272
00:22:27.080 --> 00:22:31.440
Unfortunately, it's false.
 The point goes to Mikaela.

273
00:22:32.800 --> 00:22:36.200
The school saved by moving students to a barracks.

274
00:22:36.360 --> 00:22:41.760
As by chance, the newly arrived students happened to end up there.

275
00:22:41.920 --> 00:22:44.040
By chance.

276
00:22:44.200 --> 00:22:49.320
- Mikaela?
 -Yes.
 Then I drive on Sami.

277
00:22:49.480 --> 00:22:54.560
Sami?
 The 1994 World Cup evokes happy memories of many Swedes.

278
00:22:59.880 --> 00:23:05.200
They had to be 1.40 to enter the arena.

279
00:23:09.240 --> 00:23:12.600
No, joking aside.
 Chile was ported.

280
00:23:12.760 --> 00:23:19.040
During a World Cup qualifier against Brazil, the Chilean goalkeeper-

281
00:23:19.200 --> 00:23:24.320
- To get the victory.
 He cotted himself in the face with a razor blade -

282
00:23:24.480 --> 00:23:29.840
- And blamed the Brazilian audience who thrown fireworks.

283
00:23:30.000 --> 00:23:33.960
- It sounds really sick.
 -That is sick.

284
00:23:34.120 --> 00:23:38.880
He may not have brought a razor blade on the football field.

285
00:23:39.040 --> 00:23:43.600
Roberto Rojas was called the goalkeeper.
 -89, I think it was.

286
00:23:43.760 --> 00:23:47.840
-It was -94.
 -Exactly.
 He is lying.

287
00:23:48.000 --> 00:23:51.280
- I try to fool you a little more.
 - You think he is lying?

288
00:23:51.440 --> 00:23:55.520
Then I can only say: Congratulations, Frida.
 You've got one more point.

289
00:23:55.680 --> 00:24:00.760
- He is doing so well.
 - It's sick, but true.

290
00:24:00.920 --> 00:24:05.760
Chile's national team was banned from the World Cup after goalkeeper Rojas fake -

291
00:24:05.920 --> 00:24:08.280
–That he was damaged by fireworks -

292
00:24:08.440 --> 00:24:12.440
- By cutting yourself with a razor blade on the face.

293
00:24:12.600 --> 00:24:16.320
-Oh my God.
 -What to say?
 3–3.

294
00:24:16.480 --> 00:24:20.560
Frida, you have a chance to take over.
 Who do you choose to trust?

295
00:24:20.720 --> 00:24:23.480
- Kaeli.
 -Yes.

296
00:24:25.920 --> 00:24:29.800
My mother's disappointment over my life.

297
00:24:29.960 --> 00:24:33.240
I said "comedian", she said "what?"

298
00:24:33.400 --> 00:24:37.440
The name, the knife in the heart is a suburban musical.

299
00:24:37.600 --> 00:24:42.440
The knife in the heart.
 Knit?!
 It's not even SFI.

300
00:24:42.600 --> 00:24:46.160
These are immigrants for Swedes.
 Let me be.

301
00:24:49.600 --> 00:24:54.000
- The knife in the heart was the first ... man!
 The knife!

302
00:24:54.160 --> 00:24:58.200
A KNIFE.
 Knife-en.
 Repeat after me!

303
00:24:58.360 --> 00:25:04.680
I have dropped out of school, as you notice.
 One more time.
 The knife!
 Yeah!

304
00:25:08.720 --> 00:25:12.360
- You made SFI happy and satisfied, the old man.
 - I am so happy now.

305
00:25:12.520 --> 00:25:16.920
The knife in the heart is the first suburban musical on SVT.

306
00:25:17.080 --> 00:25:21.640
For you blats who do not know what a musical is: a high school music.

307
00:25:21.800 --> 00:25:26.080
She just explained Musical with musical.

308
00:25:26.240 --> 00:25:31.160
What are you saying?
 Do you think the knife in the heart is a suburban musical?

309
00:25:31.320 --> 00:25:35.280
It could be.
 But no...

310
00:25:37.560 --> 00:25:43.000
-What are you saying?
 True or false?
 - It's false.
 We chance.

311
00:25:43.160 --> 00:25:48.960
You chance that it's fake?
 The point goes to Mikaela.

312
00:25:50.560 --> 00:25:55.880
The TV series from 2003 is about young people in the Gothenburg suburb of Bergsjön.

313
00:25:56.040 --> 00:26:01.720
The first suburban musical.
 And thank goodness, the last one too.

314
00:26:01.880 --> 00:26:04.480
Mikaela, I just want to remind you.

315
00:26:04.640 --> 00:26:07.280
If you answer correctly now, you have won everything.

316
00:26:07.440 --> 00:26:12.000
- It would be totally ... - we cheer on you.

317
00:26:12.160 --> 00:26:15.520
- You can only choose one panelist.
 –Alaf.

318
00:26:15.680 --> 00:26:19.160
-Yes, Ahmed.
 - A picture question.

319
00:26:22.680 --> 00:26:29.160
The man in the picture came to Sweden as a 20-year-old, as a refugee-

320
00:26:29.320 --> 00:26:34.280
–And started as a berry picker and square seller.

321
00:26:34.440 --> 00:26:38.400
Today he owns Åhléns.

322
00:26:38.560 --> 00:26:44.840
