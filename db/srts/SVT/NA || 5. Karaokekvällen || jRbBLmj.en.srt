00:00:01.280 --> 00:00:07.160
c.Sangvisa time i see you c.Sangslår my heart double beats ...

2
00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:14.480
Malmö Plus degrees, Fy Fan.
 We have minus eight, but it gets warmer.

3
00:00:14.640 --> 00:00:20.120
Oh, my God.
 Check!
 They will build a roundabout in the village.

4
00:00:20.280 --> 00:00:25.440
Now you have to go around that damn ring and get dizzy.

5
00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:30.080
The City Council must have hit the head.

6
00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:36.800
Check out who is celebrating years today.

7
00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:40.240
It was like hell.
 Elin!

8
00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:45.640
- Should we go and give her a gift?
 - Maybe we should.

9
00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:51.240
- What should we give her?
 - We have a lot of stuff from the mother.

10
00:00:56.880 --> 00:01:02.040
Check.
 We can give away the mother's old pearl necklace.

11
00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:05.600
That old force ...

12
00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:10.520
- But these then?
 - Flowers?

13
00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:15.560
And then you can put in a gift card ...

14
00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:20.680
You then have a lot left to learn about women.

15
00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:24.760
- Billy ... - it there?

16
00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:30.000
Such a craft causes any woman to fall asleep.

17
00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:36.120
- Do I see good?
 -Yes.

18
00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:43.800
c.Sangoch Here are some bulli-bulli buns c.Sangtill little grandmother

19
00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:50.840
-Oh!
 There you were, yes.
 - You have to congratulate.

20
00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:55.000
Thanks!
 How did you know that I am celebrating years?

21
00:01:55.160 --> 00:02:00.160
Leif looked at your Facebook, so he saw it.

22
00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:06.600
I didn't check ... it showed up in some feed, so I saw it.

23
00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:12.040
We have a small birthday present with us.
 Congratulations.

24
00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:17.880
-What is this?
 - A little owl I shot last year.

25
00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:24.640
We stopped it together.
 Leif shot obliquely, so the wing flew off ...

26
00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:30.080
- You can glue it.
 - Or make a piece of jewelry.

27
00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:33.280
The mother did always do that ...

28
00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:37.160
Thanks.
 Nice owl.

29
00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:43.320
But ... we were just thinking about coffee.
 You are welcome to have a cup of coffee.

30
00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:47.600
-Gladly!
 -It would be nice.

31
00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:06.480
- Voila, Messieurs.
 -Thanks so much.

32
00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:12.320
Take what you need.
 Those are lactose, and those are lactose -free.

33
00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:16.160
Lactose ... what is it for trams?

34
00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:22.000
Well, how do you celebrate birthdays in Stockholm, then?

35
00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:28.680
It's a little different.
 Last year I and some friends were on stand-up.

36
00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:32.840
-Stand-up?
 -What is it?

37
00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:36.480
Don't you know that?

38
00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:42.440
It is a comedian who is on a stage and jokes.
 Very funny.

39
00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:46.400
And after that we sang karaoke.

40
00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:51.080
Karaoke?
 We have that at the pizzeria.

41
00:03:51.240 --> 00:03:55.240
Is it true?!
 I love karaoke!

42
00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:59.280
Do you?
 I also love to sing.

43
00:03:59.440 --> 00:04:06.560
But damn it is some sweet song.
 You sound like an injured crow.

44
00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:10.760
It is fun!
 Shouldn't we go tonight?

45
00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:16.440
Love to!
 - Leif, we can?
 It would be fun.

46
00:04:16.600 --> 00:04:20.800
- Come again, Leif.
 -Okay...

47
00:04:20.960 --> 00:04:25.920
Damn, what fun!
 Then we decide it.
 Seven o 'clock?

48
00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:31.000
Then we have to go home, because you have to shower.

49
00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:33.640
Bowl!

50
00:05:16.200 --> 00:05:21.360
Guys, what are you doing?
 You look too damn good.

51
00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:26.720
The Finnish ferry has passed.
 You have missed it ... with 30 years!

52
00:05:30.920 --> 00:05:37.320
Hello.
 How good you are.
 Wow!
 Now I feel ...

53
00:05:37.480 --> 00:05:44.720
- I didn't change.
 - Well, we don't care that much.

54
00:05:44.880 --> 00:05:51.440
Dad plays in dance bands, so we have a lot of nice clothes at home.

55
00:05:51.600 --> 00:05:55.960
-For real?!
 - Yes, he plays in Tryggves.

56
00:05:56.120 --> 00:06:02.200
They are touring around.
 Last year we got a postcard from ... Was it Boden?

57
00:06:02.360 --> 00:06:06.280
Shit the same, shouldn't we order?

58
00:06:06.440 --> 00:06:12.400
Birthday dinner.
 Do you keep track of what to have?
 Pepper steak ...

59
00:06:12.560 --> 00:06:15.640
Two Leif and Billy Special!

60
00:06:15.800 --> 00:06:20.920
- Do you have your own pizza?
 - We are a bit of local celebrities ...

61
00:06:21.080 --> 00:06:24.400
Is it true?
 I also drive one like that.

62
00:06:24.560 --> 00:06:30.200
Three specials, when you are still on, and two beers for me and the little brother.

63
00:06:30.360 --> 00:06:36.840
It's ham, salami, minced meat, blood sausage, bacon, bearnaise -

64
00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:42.080
- Egg, mayonnaise and mustard and the whole shit on, so he's swinging.

65
00:06:42.240 --> 00:06:48.200
I know a little about something else ... - I can take Calzone!

66
00:06:48.360 --> 00:06:51.320
I can taste you.

67
00:06:57.200 --> 00:07:02.760
Then it was time for Leif Öhman.
 He will do stand-up.

68
00:07:02.920 --> 00:07:08.720
- But wait ... should you drive?
 - I sometimes test new material.

69
00:07:08.880 --> 00:07:13.880
- I latch a little, mostly fun.
 -Exciting!

70
00:07:28.960 --> 00:07:32.800
I'll just lower this ...

71
00:07:36.080 --> 00:07:38.960
C.Teletext.kjudsliktc.kudrundsdags-pip

72
00:07:41.800 --> 00:07:44.520
Yes...

73
00:07:44.680 --> 00:07:49.840
I'm going to run some stand-up.
 My name is Leif Öhman.

74
00:07:53.480 --> 00:07:56.000
Wohoo!

75
00:07:57.040 --> 00:07:59.280
Yes...

76
00:07:59.440 --> 00:08:05.680
- Fun that so many could come.
 -Come again now, thick-Leffe!

77
00:08:05.840 --> 00:08:09.960
I ran down the train station yesterday ...

78
00:08:10.120 --> 00:08:15.080
There is no train station in Sörbäcken, your puck!

79
00:08:15.240 --> 00:08:22.280
Bus station, then.
 And then I went to a train cup ... or ...

80
00:08:22.440 --> 00:08:27.520
—... The bus driver.
 - But make a joke then!

81
00:08:27.680 --> 00:08:31.760
I try a new joke.

82
00:08:31.920 --> 00:08:35.680
I ran down the pharmacy yesterday ...

83
00:08:35.840 --> 00:08:39.880
The pharmacy is closed on Sundays.

84
00:08:41.480 --> 00:08:45.120
Run it about the mole, Leif.

85
00:08:45.280 --> 00:08:51.400
Thanks, Billy.
 Now comes a pretty funny joke that I have come up with.

86
00:08:51.560 --> 00:08:56.680
Do you know which animal has the thickest leg?

87
00:08:56.840 --> 00:09:02.120
- Can it be a mole?
 - Yes, that was right.

88
00:09:02.280 --> 00:09:08.400
- Yes, then ... - then we thank Leif Öhman.
 An applause!

89
00:09:09.760 --> 00:09:13.800
Was that all?
 BUUU!

90
00:09:13.960 --> 00:09:18.680
- Get off the stage, your sweep!
 -Thanks...

91
00:09:18.840 --> 00:09:23.560
- Buu!
 Get off the stage, thick!
 - Good, Leif!

92
00:09:24.840 --> 00:09:27.240
Good!

93
00:09:28.720 --> 00:09:33.800
- What a brave you are.
 - The mic is completely gap, for fucking.

94
00:09:33.960 --> 00:09:39.280
Usually I have my own mick that I have specially ordered.

95
00:09:39.440 --> 00:09:44.360
-It was great.
 - And so I've slept poorly ...

96
00:09:44.520 --> 00:09:49.520
Time for the next person.
 Billy Öhman will sing a song.

97
00:09:49.680 --> 00:09:53.640
- Do you sing?
 - You haven't said that.

98
00:09:53.800 --> 00:09:57.760
Delivery on you, guys!

99
00:09:59.640 --> 00:10:03.680
Now you would have had hearing covers ...

100
00:10:03.840 --> 00:10:08.800
He sounds like a hooded pig when he sings.

101
00:10:14.440 --> 00:10:18.240
What the hell should we see now, then?

102
00:10:19.960 --> 00:10:23.640
Yes ... Hello on you.

103
00:10:23.800 --> 00:10:30.040
This song is dedicated to Elin Grönstedt, which is celebrating years today.

104
00:10:30.200 --> 00:10:33.960
Wooo!
 Come on, Billy!

105
00:10:51.240 --> 00:10:57.200
C.Sangja, I know that it is two c.Sangoch it's late for a Sunday night

106
00:10:57.360 --> 00:11:00.800
C.Sangmen Nothing can get me from here ...

107
00:11:00.960 --> 00:11:03.760
He can sing.

108
00:11:03.920 --> 00:11:09.120
- Should we not take anything to drink?
 - He's great!

109
00:11:09.280 --> 00:11:16.240
- Good, Billy!
 c.Sang –... you have rock'n'roll and saxophone

110
00:11:16.400 --> 00:11:22.760
C.Sang Monday morning we can forget, c.Sanget is several light years to it lights

111
00:11:22.920 --> 00:11:29.000
C.Sang Monday morning we can dream about the C.Sanget that happens to us here and now

112
00:11:29.160 --> 00:11:32.960
c.Sangför tonight, tonight c.Sangär it you, is that i

113
00:11:33.120 --> 00:11:36.280
c.Sangoch We so easily follow the team of C.Sangmen resistance

114
00:11:36.440 --> 00:11:41.760
c.Sangmot a sky that has number seven, the c.sanging stops us now

115
00:11:41.920 --> 00:11:47.400
C.Sangåh, tonight, tonight, c.Sangkom and give, come and take ...

116
00:11:47.560 --> 00:11:52.720
--Leif, you have to pay.
 - Write it up as usual.

117
00:11:52.880 --> 00:11:56.760
This is a half -year note.

118
00:11:56.920 --> 00:12:01.600
Then Billy and his new friend can pay.

119
00:12:01.760 --> 00:12:04.760
c.Sang ... and we so easily follow the law of c.Sangmen resistance

120
00:12:04.920 --> 00:12:10.040
c.Sangmot a sky that has number seven, the c.sanging stops us now

121
00:12:10.200 --> 00:12:14.120
C.Sanging stops us now

122
00:12:19.440 --> 00:12:23.800
- Fan, how good you are at singing!
 -Do you think?

123
00:12:23.960 --> 00:12:28.840
- Where is Leif?
 -Card or cash?

124
00:12:31.400 --> 00:12:34.400
- You know where Leif is?
 -He went.

125
00:12:34.560 --> 00:12:37.560
Has he pulled?

126
00:12:37.720 --> 00:12:40.680
SEK 3,244?

127
00:12:40.840 --> 00:12:46.080
This is six months' note.
 Unfortunately, I must have paid.

128
00:12:46.240 --> 00:12:51.760
Pizza, pizza ... 37 beers in one evening!

129
00:12:51.920 --> 00:12:57.840
What should we do with this?
 I can't pay all this.

130
00:13:01.400 --> 00:13:07.360
No, damn ... I have nothing on me.
 Leif usually takes care of my money.

131
00:13:07.520 --> 00:13:11.560
I'll solve it then.

132
00:13:13.560 --> 00:13:16.640
-So.
 -Thanks so much.

133
00:13:16.800 --> 00:13:22.520
- Congratulations birthday anyway.
 -Thanks so much.
