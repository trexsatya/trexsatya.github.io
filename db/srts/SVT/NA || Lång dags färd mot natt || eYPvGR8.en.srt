00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:28.120
Think, tomorrow is New Year's Eve.
 16 of our years together are coming to an end.

6
00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:36.840

33
00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:45.120
C. Head talkative father said that a life without adventure C. Head talkative is nothing worth it!

34
00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:52.120

35
00:04:52.280 --> 00:04:59.520
Dad, may I ask one thing?
 Was your life that you had imagined?

36
00:04:59.680 --> 00:05:04.440
C. Head talk - yes - actually.

40
00:05:23.760 --> 00:05:31.400
C. Head talkum is done at your age.
 But my C. Head Praise father taught me something before he died.

41
00:05:31.560 --> 00:05:36.000
To open a sardine can with one hand.

42
00:05:36.160 --> 00:05:43.160
C. Head Tapersehan looked me in the eyes and said: C. Head Tapers "make you no hopes".

43
00:05:45.120 --> 00:05:50.400
C. Head talk - "Then you will never be disappointed."
 -How horrible!

44
00:05:50.560 --> 00:05:58.200
C. Head talk and therefore I have done the opposite.
 C. Head Tableman must believe that everything is possible!

45
00:05:58.360 --> 00:06:03.680
If I find something I want to do, you help me?

46
00:06:03.840 --> 00:06:11.400
C. Head talk - yes, in 15 years you want to move well.

 But we don't throw you out!

48
00:06:19.360 --> 00:06:21.920

00:06:22.080 --> 00:06:26.960
Surely we can celebrate the twelve in the square?

50
00:06:27.120 --> 00:06:31.800
- It seems fun as a change?
 C. Head talk - no.

51
00:06:31.960 --> 00:06:36.600

- We will go soon.
 - We don't like Aunt Karin.

59
00:07:23.600 --> 00:07:32.840
She doesn't like you either.
 But on New Year's Eve, the family drinks coffee there.

60
00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:39.920
- I would rather stay home.
 -Me too!
 Uncle Hans smells bad.

61
00:07:40.080 --> 00:07:45.720
Yes.
 Dad is allowed to sit next to him.
 Go and change!

62
00:07:45.880 --> 00:07:50.160
Put on a dress, rope.

00:07:51.400 --> 00:07:58.840
Good that you came.
 We will buy flowers on the road.
 Why do you look like that?

64
00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:05.440
This New Year's Eve we will do something new.

00:08:17.080 --> 00:08:22.920
- Every year you try to get away!

68
00:08:23.080 --> 00:08:30.520
C. Head talk - I try to avoid Aunt Karin.

69
00:08:30.680 --> 00:08:37.520

 C. Head talk - she does not recognize us!

70
00:08:37.680 --> 00:08:43.880
- Last year I was "Mr. Lagerwall".
 - I can't go ...

71
00:08:44.040 --> 00:08:49.560
You never have to meet Aunt Karin anymore.

72
00:08:49.720 --> 00:08:56.040
C. Head talk - you should not regret it!
 - Mom, we go if you want.

73
00:08:56.200 --> 00:09:04.040
C. Head talk - no, in two minutes Ivanhoe begins.

00:09:10.960 --> 00:09:18.400
C. Head talkative self buys skis, spruce - and video C. Head talk I do not know how it works.

76
00:09:18.560 --> 00:09:25.560
C. Head talk - everything for you to enjoy it!

77
00:09:25.720 --> 00:09:29.560
Or just you two.

78
00:09:29.720 --> 00:09:37.720
C. The head talk is hard to be a father.
 We want C. Head talkators about the material standard.

79
00:09:37.880 --> 00:09:44.280

That we have to go through the same procedure every year!

85
00:10:24.560 --> 00:10:31.200

 C. Head talk - think when we look out ...

87
00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:41.960

 Don't you like to spend time with us?

110
00:12:47.160 --> 00:12:53.600
We cannot come today because we have other plans.

C. Head Tapers What are you dreaming of, Max?

151
00:17:16.120 --> 00:17:21.560
About that there is peace and that the school burns down.

 C. Head talk - pick up the peanut rings and must.

160
00:18:14.800 --> 00:18:19.400
C. Head talkative prawns directly from the Arctic Ocean to you ...

161
00:18:19.560 --> 00:18:24.200
... via six months in Konsum's freezer counter.

162
00:18:24.360 --> 00:18:32.200
C. Head talkative thinking, it is strange ... by all C. Head talkatives shrimp in the Antarctic water -

163
00:18:32.360 --> 00:18:41.400
C. Head talk - Hams this particular on my plate.
 C. Head talkative self wonders if it was predetermined.

164
00:18:41.560 --> 00:18:47.680

165
00:18:47.840 --> 00:18:51.680
Is this important?

166
00:18:51.840 --> 00:18:56.280
C. Head Certificate does not.
 Give me the chili mayonnaise!

167
00:18:56.440 --> 00:19:02.480
- Where is Max?
 C. Head talk - I don't think he wants shrimp.

168
00:19:02.640 --> 00:19:10.760
C. Head Taper happened when we set up the rockets C. Head talk - he wanted to be for himself.

169
00:19:10.920 --> 00:19:16.560
Don't leave him alone when he starts thinking!

170
00:19:16.720 --> 00:19:23.200
C. Head TapersHur Many shrimp Should we add C. Head Tapers?
 Eight?
 Four?
 Three...

171
00:19:26.440 --> 00:19:33.280
Little old man, are you here?
 Why don't you get down to us?

172
00:19:33.440 --> 00:19:39.800
How did you have it before I and Lina were born?
 Was it more fun?

173
00:19:39.960 --> 00:19:46.200
The old man ... It is clear that everything became more fun when you arrived.

174
00:19:46.360 --> 00:19:53.600
At least more difficult.
 You get a lot to think about ... Why do you ask?

175
00:19:53.760 --> 00:19:59.680
Time goes by so fast.
 I remember the summer when I was six years old.

176
00:19:59.840 --> 00:20:07.800
- I thought you could swim!
 -It's not that.
 Everything was so easy.

177
00:20:07.960 --> 00:20:16.040
We played on the beach, went up and ate and then we could go and play again.

178
00:20:16.200 --> 00:20:21.240
You can still play as much as you want!

179
00:20:21.400 --> 00:20:28.040
No!
 Soon I start high school and then everything is over.

180
00:20:28.200 --> 00:20:32.040
I have to get girlfriend -

181
00:20:32.200 --> 00:20:37.760
- Appeal Roll - On and play drums in some band.

182
00:20:37.920 --> 00:20:45.480
You think too much.
 At your age you do not want to become an adult.
 You learn.

183
00:20:45.640 --> 00:20:52.360
- You can't fight against?
 - That life takes one where it wants.

184
00:20:52.520 --> 00:20:57.760
- To a townhouse in Vivalla?
 -Why not?

185
00:20:57.920 --> 00:21:03.840
I have two wonderful kids, and a man who is okay ...

186
00:21:04.000 --> 00:21:10.240
- Dad has soon eaten the shrimp!
 - Take them up!
 And Dad.

187
00:21:10.400 --> 00:21:14.280
The shrimp is enough.

188
00:21:14.440 --> 00:21:21.800
Max ... once when I was little and low and thought like this ...

189
00:21:21.960 --> 00:21:28.600
--... Then Dad said something very wise.
 -What then?
 "Go to sleep"?

190
00:21:28.760 --> 00:21:36.080
"Life is always next to you and you can do whatever you want with it."

191
00:21:36.240 --> 00:21:42.360
- Here we come with all the shrimp!
 - Watch down, so we eat.

192
00:21:42.520 --> 00:21:47.960
- Mums!
 C. Head talk - How is it, max?
 Are you sad?

193
00:21:48.120 --> 00:21:54.480
- No, it's better now.
 C. Head Tapers - Bra.
 I'll make you really happy!

194
00:21:54.640 --> 00:22:00.480
- Should you go again?
 C. Head Tapers-No.
 You have longed, and this year ...

195
00:22:01.520 --> 00:22:08.960
C. HOVA PATEREDU SHOULD ARE LIGHT at the fireworks!
 C. Head talk - I stand next to all the time.

196
00:22:09.120 --> 00:22:14.760
That's probably what mom is afraid of ... Three shrimp left.

197
00:22:14.920 --> 00:22:18.440
C. Head Tapers I can take them!

198
00:22:25.600 --> 00:22:31.520
C. Head Tapers - Ok, give me a bottle.
 - What are you doing?

199
00:22:31.680 --> 00:22:35.280
C. Head talk fixes the champagne.

200
00:22:35.440 --> 00:22:41.320
C. Head talk - selection de loire and our bag!
 - It can't be drinked.

201
00:22:41.480 --> 00:22:45.920
C. Head talk, you can mix it C. Head Trocado.

202
00:22:46.080 --> 00:22:53.800

203
00:22:54.640 --> 00:23:00.240
C. Head talk - ni looks best from the bedroom.
 -Exciting!

204
00:23:00.400 --> 00:23:07.720
That they can ... What is so fun?
 That it slams?

205
00:23:07.880 --> 00:23:15.320
- It has to do with masculinity.
 - You mean it's idiotic?

206
00:23:15.480 --> 00:23:22.600
Happy New Year!
 I will be nagging dad so you can go on a language trip.

207
00:23:22.760 --> 00:23:29.360

208
00:23:29.520 --> 00:23:33.640
Wouldn't you postpone the rocket?

209
00:23:33.800 --> 00:23:39.680
- Did it stay nice?
 - It was hard to see.
 - Were you satisfied?

210
00:23:39.840 --> 00:23:44.640
C. Head Precate ... a little butt chop it felt.

211

00:23:54.920 --> 00:23:59.040
No, everyone got out.

214
00:23:59.200 --> 00:24:04.840
- Majesty took a round in their kitchen.
 - I had to extinguish.

215
00:24:05.000 --> 00:24:08.960
But the smoke remains ...

216
00:24:09.120 --> 00:24:14.960
