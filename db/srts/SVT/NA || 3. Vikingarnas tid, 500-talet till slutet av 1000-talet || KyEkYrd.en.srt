1
00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:13.720
The men here have been defeated in battle.

2
00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:19.720
They sailed from Mälardalen west of the Baltic to plunder and war.

3
00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:22.680
But they lost.

4
00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:30.120
But their fate should not deter others from trying again.
 On the contrary.

5
00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:34.280
Many Norwegians will follow after-

6
00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:38.920
- And the world will know them as ... Vikings.

7
00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:52.040
We are now at the end of the Iron Age, and a new era is on the way.
 Viking Age.

8
00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:56.240
Farmers from our country leave to sea-

9
00:01:56.400 --> 00:02:01.400
- And is known throughout Europe, and further away than that.

10
00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:07.040
The Vikings bring wealth and new knowledge back here to the Nordic countries.

11
00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:10.360
But over time a new religion will be root-

12
00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:14.040
- which challenges the Vikings' way of life.

13
00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:22.200
This is the story of our country.

14
00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:27.120
About the people and forces that have shaped it -

15
00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:31.200
- Endure from the ice age until our days.

16
00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:49.960
This is the story of Sweden.

17
00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:15.440
It's actually August, and it's in the middle of the day -

18
00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:19.080
- Even if it doesn't look that way.

19
00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:23.400
The year is 536 and a disaster has occurred.

20
00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:43.200
It is one of the worst crises in our history.

21
00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:05.400
For three years, the sun's rays cannot penetrate the cloud cover to the ground.

22
00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:11.160
It's like a three -year winter.

23
00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:08.960
A climate disaster has hit Scandinavia.

24
00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:14.360
Away half of all people living here die from cold and starvation.

25
00:05:20.760 --> 00:05:27.120
A series of major volcanic eruptions have fateful consequences in Scandinavia.

26
00:05:27.280 --> 00:05:32.840
In 536, somewhere in the Northern Hemisphere, comes a gigantic volcanic eruption.

27
00:05:34.080 --> 00:05:38.840
And then a volcanic eruption in the tropics.

28
00:05:42.280 --> 00:05:46.080
Together they throw up so much gas particles in the atmosphere -

29
00:05:46.240 --> 00:05:49.320
- The solar energy for the earth's surface is declining.

30
00:05:49.480 --> 00:05:54.800
We get global cooling, especially strong up here on our latitudes.

31
00:05:54.960 --> 00:05:59.560
We know that in Scandinavia the population is almost halved.

32
00:06:07.880 --> 00:06:11.080
It must have been a terrible suffering -

33
00:06:11.240 --> 00:06:15.280
–And it is possible that the memory of the event may be preserved -

34
00:06:15.440 --> 00:06:19.040
- In ancient Nordic mythology.

35
00:06:19.200 --> 00:06:24.200
In the ancient Nordic myths, Ragnarök begins with the Fimbul Winter -

36
00:06:24.360 --> 00:06:31.600
- The big, powerful winter that lasts for three years without summer.

37
00:06:34.520 --> 00:06:39.960
People probably thought the downfall of the world was close.

38
00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:48.080
It is said that nature makes rebellion - winter storms, sea is flooded.

39
00:06:51.120 --> 00:06:56.520
They turn to the gods, who have abandoned them.

40
00:06:56.680 --> 00:07:03.080
How should they regain the help of the gods?
 They sacrifice, they pray to the gods.

41
00:07:14.360 --> 00:07:17.720
The Norwegians have many gods.

42
00:07:17.880 --> 00:07:23.800
Odin is the most powerful, and it is mainly the warriors who worship him.

43
00:07:25.720 --> 00:07:31.080
But for the peasants, Tor, Frej and Freja are the most important gods.

44
00:07:32.920 --> 00:07:38.240
They are the ones who have power over weather, greenery and fertility.

45
00:08:02.840 --> 00:08:06.840
Probably the people believe that their victim gifts help -

46
00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:11.600
- For several years of malnutrition, nature recovers.

47
00:08:11.760 --> 00:08:15.800
The climate is slowly but surely returning to the normal-

48
00:08:15.960 --> 00:08:19.040
- And the crops are starting to grow again.

49
00:08:19.200 --> 00:08:22.160
The great starvation is over.

50
00:08:33.280 --> 00:08:36.600
Northern residents slowly rise out of the disaster -

51
00:08:36.760 --> 00:08:40.760
–And for a few hundred years the culture and the community - are formed

52
00:08:40.920 --> 00:08:44.000
- Which will be the Vikings.

53
00:08:46.320 --> 00:08:50.040
Sweden is not a country at this time.

54
00:08:50.200 --> 00:08:56.120
It is a lot of small kingdoms that are controlled by different families and kings.

55
00:08:59.880 --> 00:09:05.240
There are places where people are gathered, so -called.
 Central places.

56
00:09:08.680 --> 00:09:13.320
One of the largest is Uppåkra, five kilometers south of Lund.

57
00:09:13.480 --> 00:09:17.280
What characterizes Uppåkra is a residence -

58
00:09:17.440 --> 00:09:21.600
–Dvs.
 A large hall building with a cult house next door.

59
00:09:21.760 --> 00:09:26.560
In the cult house we have found lots of gold guys.

60
00:09:27.920 --> 00:09:33.760
Two fantastic beverage cups show that they had ceremonies.

61
00:09:33.920 --> 00:09:39.600
And these ceremonies tie society together in a common worldview.

62
00:09:43.360 --> 00:09:47.480
The central places are important meeting places.

63
00:09:47.640 --> 00:09:54.000
There, the rulers can control trade, plan war and ship justice.

64
00:09:54.160 --> 00:09:59.840
The most important central place in Mälardalen is located in Gamla Uppsala.

65
00:10:04.560 --> 00:10:07.360
Here was the royal seat of the Svers.

66
00:10:07.520 --> 00:10:13.040
And these piles are royal tombs from about 600.

67
00:10:13.200 --> 00:10:18.200
Building such huge monuments requires great organizational ability -

68
00:10:18.360 --> 00:10:21.360
- And a lot of labor.

69
00:10:21.520 --> 00:10:27.480
Such central places are found throughout the country, near rivers and streams.

70
00:10:27.640 --> 00:10:30.840
Or by the sea, where it is easy to get.

71
00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:35.160
At this time, large parts of the country are underwater.

72
00:10:35.320 --> 00:10:40.120
In some places, the sea level is almost six meters higher than today.

73
00:10:40.280 --> 00:10:45.920
The most fastest way to get ahead was on water, not land.

74
00:10:46.080 --> 00:10:52.840
The waterways were like highways, and that was mainly the way the trade took.

75
00:11:02.080 --> 00:11:08.600
The trade routes are profitable.
 The kings are competing to control them.

76
00:11:08.760 --> 00:11:11.560
People are already traveling over the ocean-

77
00:11:11.720 --> 00:11:16.560
- But the trade routes also go far up in northern Scandinavia.

78
00:11:16.720 --> 00:11:19.520
Trade is becoming increasingly important -

79
00:11:19.680 --> 00:11:24.000
–And during the mid-700s Birka occurs at Björkö–

80
00:11:24.160 --> 00:11:29.280
- As will dominate trade throughout Mälardalen for over 200 years.

81
00:11:46.520 --> 00:11:52.080
Birka is not a central place like the others.
 It is more of an early city -

82
00:11:52.240 --> 00:11:57.320
- Where you mainly deal with long -distance trading and crafts.

83
00:12:06.800 --> 00:12:12.400
A place where people meet and change goods with each other.

84
00:12:17.480 --> 00:12:20.840
Most often you change utensils -

85
00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:25.000
- But there are also amber and expensive fabrics -

86
00:12:25.160 --> 00:12:28.680
- As can come far from the south.

87
00:12:35.640 --> 00:12:40.320
It obviously happens that there will be disputes about business settlements.

88
00:12:40.480 --> 00:12:46.520
But where many people meet, other conflicts and fractions also arise.

89
00:13:05.960 --> 00:13:10.400
To curb violence spirals and avoid blood revenge -

90
00:13:10.560 --> 00:13:15.560
- So the Vikings resolve their conflicts on court places like this.

91
00:13:15.720 --> 00:13:20.760
You select important places that you have returned to generations.

92
00:13:20.920 --> 00:13:25.240
There you find out injustices and make joint decisions.

93
00:13:32.040 --> 00:13:37.560
Coming to a thing for the first time must be a great experience.

94
00:13:39.920 --> 00:13:42.920
You end up in the center of events.

95
00:13:43.080 --> 00:13:48.200
Here men and women meet with power a few times a year.

96
00:13:48.360 --> 00:13:51.360
This is where the big decisions are made.

97
00:13:51.520 --> 00:13:56.840
The word lives in Swedish, as in "county council" and "district court".

98
00:14:02.560 --> 00:14:07.600
Written sources provide an insight into what the Vikings take up on the thing:

99
00:14:07.760 --> 00:14:12.760
Divorces, thefts, murders and ground disputes.

100
00:14:12.920 --> 00:14:17.800
The law was oral.
 The laws did not write down until the Middle Ages.

101
00:14:17.960 --> 00:14:23.120
The laws were in verse, and they were repeated to remember them.

102
00:14:25.800 --> 00:14:30.640
The judges were collective decisions.
 Most often there were probably twelve officials -

103
00:14:30.800 --> 00:14:35.800
- As the law interpreted and made a joint decision, and that was the verdict.

104
00:14:35.960 --> 00:14:41.280
Women also participate.
 They have inheritance rights and can own large assets.

105
00:14:43.080 --> 00:14:47.960
Much indicates that every tenth court is a woman.

106
00:14:48.120 --> 00:14:52.400
In ancient Nordic, "man" means man, regardless of gender.

107
00:14:52.560 --> 00:14:55.960
A town can thus be a woman.

108
00:14:56.120 --> 00:14:59.040
It was a form of democracy -

109
00:14:59.200 --> 00:15:04.480
- Then a relatively large part of society had the right to bring an action on the thing.

110
00:15:10.800 --> 00:15:15.120
It was common with inheritance disputes and ground shops.

111
00:15:15.280 --> 00:15:18.560
Because one had no written contracts -

112
00:15:18.720 --> 00:15:23.320
- So they had a stick that represented the ground.

113
00:15:23.480 --> 00:15:28.560
And when the stick had changed owners, the land had also done so.

114
00:15:36.440 --> 00:15:41.960
When you gather at the thing, you take the opportunity to talk about something else as well.

115
00:15:42.120 --> 00:15:46.520
For example, Viking trains and looting.

116
00:15:54.720 --> 00:15:59.440
Looting were important for young men, who could travel out a few years -

117
00:15:59.600 --> 00:16:03.840
–And come home with riches, set up a farm -

118
00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:07.000
- And get a new, rich life.

119
00:16:17.680 --> 00:16:23.400
Plundering trains are large companies.
 They require planning, supplies and weapons.

120
00:16:23.560 --> 00:16:27.880
And above all, you need to build a large number of boats.

121
00:16:28.040 --> 00:16:33.440
The boats are one of the keys to the Vikings' success.

122
00:16:54.200 --> 00:16:59.000
The carpenters who built the boats were incredibly skilled professionals.

123
00:16:59.160 --> 00:17:04.560
Their main tool was the ax.
 They could get to plank or table-

124
00:17:04.720 --> 00:17:10.960
–As 15-20 mm thick and at the same time durable and agile -

125
00:17:11.120 --> 00:17:16.880
- What these boats made these boats light and sustainable at the same time.

126
00:17:27.600 --> 00:17:33.840
With their low weight, they are quick to rest, they are basic and silent.

127
00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:38.200
They are nice to sail in headwinds and get pretty good speed.

128
00:17:38.360 --> 00:17:43.680
They are really perfect for the waters around here.

129
00:17:45.400 --> 00:17:50.000
They had many different kinds of ships, but the spine in all was the keel.

130
00:17:50.160 --> 00:17:55.840
It was strong, but flexible to withstand the forces and movements of the sea.

131
00:17:56.000 --> 00:18:01.520
It could go far out in the open sea without breaking the ship.

132
00:18:07.040 --> 00:18:11.840
In the smithy, axes, swords and spears are manufactured.

133
00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:15.720
Here all the rivets of the ships are also forged.

134
00:18:25.120 --> 00:18:30.120
In excavations of the Viking ship, the wooden hull itself is rarely left.

135
00:18:30.280 --> 00:18:32.280
However, the rivets remain.

136
00:18:32.440 --> 00:18:37.440
And their placement at the excavation can reveal what form the ship had.

137
00:18:37.600 --> 00:18:42.880
But what is new about the Vikings' ship is that they set sail on them.

138
00:18:43.040 --> 00:18:46.400
And the sails mark the start of the Viking Age.

139
00:18:55.840 --> 00:19:01.000
The sail is a prerequisite for embarking on that type of travel.

140
00:19:01.160 --> 00:19:06.360
But it also requires that society has reached a new organizational level.

141
00:19:06.520 --> 00:19:11.520
Making a single sail takes one person two full working years-

142
00:19:11.680 --> 00:19:15.080
- Seven days a week, eight hours a day.

143
00:19:19.520 --> 00:19:24.320
We believe that those who manufacture the sails are a labor force -

144
00:19:24.480 --> 00:19:30.880
- Of female slaves, slaves or free, which produces just sails.

145
00:19:31.040 --> 00:19:36.000
Slave labor is a very important part of the Viking Age society.

146
00:19:36.160 --> 00:19:41.960
It is usually talked about that one fifth of the population is non -free.

147
00:19:44.040 --> 00:19:47.360
A ship takes many months to build-

148
00:19:47.520 --> 00:19:52.600
- But when all preparation is clear, it's time to leave.

149
00:20:08.600 --> 00:20:12.920
It is usually young men traveling with the ships.

150
00:20:14.080 --> 00:20:17.320
Because only the eldest son inherits the farm -

151
00:20:17.480 --> 00:20:22.280
- Is the Viking trains particularly attractive to the younger brothers.

152
00:20:29.600 --> 00:20:35.000
They can travel out for a few years and then come home with reputation and wealth.

153
00:20:46.560 --> 00:20:52.320
We have many written sources, including the so -called.
 the King's

154
00:20:52.480 --> 00:20:56.760
- which tells about the Vikings' travel and ravages.

155
00:20:56.920 --> 00:21:02.160
They were traded orally, and then there have probably been people -

156
00:21:02.320 --> 00:21:08.200
- As has been the task of passing them on to the next generation.

157
00:21:21.240 --> 00:21:26.680
In the details you get a general picture of how people lived at that time.

158
00:21:26.840 --> 00:21:32.240
There are stories about individuals that we know have been on real -

159
00:21:32.400 --> 00:21:38.400
- Among other things one of the early Uppsala kings, called Yngvar.

160
00:21:39.680 --> 00:21:43.120
It is said that Yngvar was a great warrior -

161
00:21:43.280 --> 00:21:48.400
- As a result of Svea kingdom against attacks from Denmark and the Baltic Sea.

162
00:21:48.560 --> 00:21:51.600
He belonged to the famous Yngling House -

163
00:21:51.760 --> 00:21:56.880
- Which ruled in Central Sweden, Mälardalen, the area around Uppsala.

164
00:21:57.040 --> 00:22:00.800
Yngvar had recently quit peace with the Danes -

165
00:22:00.960 --> 00:22:05.960
- When he went out with several ships to plunder and war in Estonia.

166
00:22:06.120 --> 00:22:08.320
This is how it says ...

167
00:22:13.320 --> 00:22:20.640
King Yngvar made peace with the Danes and then began to ravage east.

168
00:22:22.520 --> 00:22:28.080
One summer he sailed to Estonia with his warriors -

169
00:22:28.240 --> 00:22:32.360
–And ravaged a place called Stein.

170
00:22:39.240 --> 00:22:43.280
The Estonians gathered many warriors to the defense -

171
00:22:43.440 --> 00:22:46.320
- And they began to fight each other.

172
00:22:46.480 --> 00:22:53.200
The Estonians were so many that the Swedes could not resist.

173
00:23:29.360 --> 00:23:33.560
King Yngvar fell.

174
00:23:41.240 --> 00:23:44.440
Yngvar and his men defeated -

175
00:23:44.600 --> 00:23:49.960
- And according to the royal stories, they are buried in their ships on the beach.

176
00:24:10.160 --> 00:24:17.080
In another source it says that Yngvar was killed by the inhabitants of the island of Eysysla.

177
00:24:17.240 --> 00:24:21.400
It is the old name for Ösel in Estonia.

178
00:24:32.200 --> 00:24:39.040
1,250 years later, a spectacular find is made just on Ösel.

179
00:24:39.200 --> 00:24:42.840
When to build a cycle path outside the SALME -

180
00:24:43.000 --> 00:24:48.200
- You can find the remains of two tombs with 41 dead warriors.

181
00:24:56.600 --> 00:25:01.400
The find is a bit of a sensation.
 The wood was not left-

182
00:25:01.560 --> 00:25:04.680
- But the iron rivets were neatly lined up.

183
00:25:04.840 --> 00:25:08.600
You see exactly what the largest ship has looked like.

184
00:25:08.760 --> 00:25:12.920
The ships and warriors can be dated to the middle of the 7th century.

185
00:25:13.080 --> 00:25:17.720
It is exciting, because that means the largest of the two boats -

186
00:25:17.880 --> 00:25:21.840
- Is one of the oldest sailboats in the Nordic countries.

187
00:25:27.640 --> 00:25:31.640
For a long time we have learned that the Viking Age began -

188
00:25:31.800 --> 00:25:36.160
- With the looting of a monastery in northern England in 793.

189
00:25:36.320 --> 00:25:39.640
But there was no such sharp limit.

190
00:25:39.800 --> 00:25:45.240
The discovery of Ösel shows that Vikings were out and looted on Estonia's coast -

191
00:25:45.400 --> 00:25:48.320
- More than half a century earlier.

192
00:25:48.480 --> 00:25:53.840
And they have probably looted around the entire Baltic Sea long before that.

193
00:26:03.280 --> 00:26:10.040
Analyzes of the skeleton say that the crew has come from Mälardalen.

194
00:26:10.200 --> 00:26:14.960
They seem to have been quite rich.
 The dead were certainly warriors -

195
00:26:15.120 --> 00:26:21.240
- And they brought gifts to life after this before the trip to Valhall.

196
00:26:24.920 --> 00:26:28.240
41 dead warriors.

197
00:26:29.040 --> 00:26:33.640
Each of them has a sword by the side of them.

198
00:26:36.560 --> 00:26:40.320
And game pieces, hundreds.

199
00:26:40.480 --> 00:26:44.240
Someone has posted them on the dead.

200
00:26:44.400 --> 00:26:48.480
There is a game piece that is the king of the game.

201
00:26:49.920 --> 00:26:55.800
Unlike all other pieces, it has been put in the mouth of the skeleton.

202
00:26:59.520 --> 00:27:04.960
Obviously you ask if it can't be King Yngvar -

203
00:27:05.120 --> 00:27:09.480
- As is there in the boat in Salme on Ösel.

204
00:27:16.720 --> 00:27:21.840
We can't be sure that it's really Yngvar's skeleton.

205
00:27:22.000 --> 00:27:25.400
But that's a tickling thought.

206
00:27:46.520 --> 00:27:50.800
These game pieces are also interesting in themselves.

207
00:27:52.800 --> 00:27:57.600
What is fascinating about them is that they are made of the election legs.

208
00:27:57.760 --> 00:28:03.920
And whales are not found naturally in the Baltic Sea.
 So where do they come from?

209
00:29:00.680 --> 00:29:05.120
It is here, in Northern Norway, that the elections are chased.

210
00:29:05.280 --> 00:29:11.440
It is from here legs, roller coaster, trans oil and other goods are transported further.

211
00:29:11.600 --> 00:29:14.200
Also to Sweden.

212
00:29:17.760 --> 00:29:23.760
The Vikings live and work along the entire Norwegian coast, up to Lofoten.

213
00:29:39.480 --> 00:29:42.760
But they are not alone.

214
00:29:48.280 --> 00:29:53.080
Here also lives Sami, who chase choices and wildlife.

215
00:30:08.720 --> 00:30:13.200
Choices are an important resource for both Norwegians and Sami.

216
00:30:13.360 --> 00:30:17.360
We find, for example, the ribs of choices, as one has been made of woven by -

217
00:30:17.520 --> 00:30:21.720
-And very beautiful whale tiles found in women's tombs.

218
00:30:22.520 --> 00:30:26.760
We also see it in the form of game pieces.

219
00:30:32.920 --> 00:30:36.920
Those who are specialists in hunting and catching are the Sami.

220
00:30:37.080 --> 00:30:42.400
Nordic society has turned in a direction that is towards the farm, agriculture.

221
00:30:42.560 --> 00:30:46.840
Here are two groups that have two different special features -

222
00:30:47.000 --> 00:30:51.960
- which is in a context and an interaction, as quite equal parties.

223
00:30:54.000 --> 00:30:58.000
The Sami also manufacture ropes and processed horns and legs -

224
00:30:58.160 --> 00:31:01.360
- which are sought after by the Vikings.

225
00:31:05.200 --> 00:31:09.120
In exchange, the Sami get fabrics, axes in iron -

226
00:31:09.280 --> 00:31:14.840
- And buckles, buttons and other metal objects.

227
00:31:18.040 --> 00:31:22.520
On the other side of the mountain chain, eastward, in Swedish Norrland -

228
00:31:22.680 --> 00:31:26.760
- The Vikings also trade with people groups living here.

229
00:31:26.920 --> 00:31:31.720
Among other things, Sami, and a Finnish -speaking group called Kväner.

230
00:31:34.480 --> 00:31:39.640
In the Swedish mountains, along the rivers, in the deep forests down to Uppland-

231
00:31:39.800 --> 00:31:44.640
- established a collaboration between Sami and other Norwegians.

232
00:31:44.800 --> 00:31:48.640
There were groups with different cultural identities.

233
00:31:48.800 --> 00:31:55.000
And the meetings were a prerequisite for the Vikings' trade activities.

234
00:32:01.720 --> 00:32:08.000
The goods are shipped south, along the coast and through the inland of the rivers.

235
00:32:08.160 --> 00:32:12.400
In the end they are replaced by silver and other valuable items -

236
00:32:12.560 --> 00:32:15.360
- Maybe many hundreds of miles away.

237
00:32:15.520 --> 00:32:19.520
But the Vikings are not just traders.

238
00:32:22.000 --> 00:32:27.640
They are notorious for their ravages and looting around Europe.

239
00:32:29.480 --> 00:32:35.680
In the 8th century, the Vikings make raids in today's United Kingdom and France.

240
00:32:35.840 --> 00:32:40.640
They start with single attacks, but after a while they establish themselves -

241
00:32:40.800 --> 00:32:46.320
- And becomes a real power factor throughout Northern Europe.

242
00:32:52.280 --> 00:32:56.880
The Vikings go far west, all the way to America.

243
00:32:57.040 --> 00:32:59.720
But they also travel east.

244
00:32:59.880 --> 00:33:05.760
In over Baltic rivers, and rivers in today's Russia and Ukraine.

245
00:33:09.240 --> 00:33:12.880
As the North residents settled in the area.

246
00:33:13.040 --> 00:33:19.200
There, together with the local population, they built fortified trading venues.

247
00:33:19.360 --> 00:33:22.560
The area is usually called the Rushes Kingdom.

248
00:33:22.720 --> 00:33:27.960
The name probably comes from Roslagen, which the Vikings came from.

249
00:33:28.120 --> 00:33:32.520
A long time later, the Rushers' Kingdom became part of the foundation -

250
00:33:32.680 --> 00:33:35.600
- To what would be called Russia.

251
00:33:44.960 --> 00:33:49.960
Northern residents were committed to successful trading in the east.
 A prerequisite was -

252
00:33:50.120 --> 00:33:54.880
- The large rivers Volga and Dnepr in today's Russia and Ukraine.

253
00:33:55.040 --> 00:34:00.000
They were like a highway, the combined factor in the trade route.

254
00:34:03.280 --> 00:34:07.920
There are no easy trips.
 The rivers have many difficult rapids -

255
00:34:08.080 --> 00:34:13.360
- And sometimes you have to pull the boats long distances over land.

256
00:34:13.520 --> 00:34:16.520
But the Vikings' boats are relatively light-

257
00:34:16.680 --> 00:34:20.680
- And can be taken past the obstacles with muscle power.

258
00:34:21.800 --> 00:34:27.800
Along the rivers DNEPR and Volga, the Norwegians take on with their precious cargo -

259
00:34:27.960 --> 00:34:34.640
- For sale south, all the way down to the Black Sea and the Caspian Sea.

260
00:34:37.240 --> 00:34:42.600
But the Vikings are not just about furs and crafts.

261
00:34:42.760 --> 00:34:46.920
There is something that is even more profitable.

262
00:35:12.720 --> 00:35:17.320
Trade in labor, or slaves.

263
00:35:19.520 --> 00:35:24.160
And slaves do not have to pay for.
 They take them.

264
00:35:36.400 --> 00:35:41.080
The word "slave" in the Swedish comes from the slaves, the peoples -

265
00:35:41.240 --> 00:35:46.240
- which was taken prisoner along the way to be sold as a slave worker.

266
00:35:46.400 --> 00:35:51.400
Slave trade was probably a very important economic factor-

267
00:35:51.560 --> 00:35:57.280
- In the Viking -Age society, more important than we may have understood.

268
00:35:59.000 --> 00:36:03.000
It took the Scandinavians on very long trips.

269
00:36:09.760 --> 00:36:13.760
All the way down to Constantinople, or Miklagård -

270
00:36:13.920 --> 00:36:18.960
- The big place, "The Big Place", which the Vikings called the city.

271
00:36:23.920 --> 00:36:28.920
Constantinople was the Eastern Roman, or Byzantine Empire's capital -

272
00:36:29.080 --> 00:36:34.000
- Where the emperor had his palace.
 And there were jobs for the Vikings.

273
00:36:36.120 --> 00:36:39.800
Some Norwegians took up the Emperor -

274
00:36:39.960 --> 00:36:45.320
- And became a kind of elite garde, bodyguards.
 They were called Values.

275
00:36:45.480 --> 00:36:50.360
They were known to be skilled warriors.

276
00:36:52.520 --> 00:36:57.680
When the Norwegians are out on their travels, they not only collect wealth -

277
00:36:57.840 --> 00:37:01.280
–On also new impressions and thoughts.

278
00:37:01.440 --> 00:37:07.000
Everything eventually finds here to Scandinavia and Sweden.

279
00:37:46.720 --> 00:37:51.520
Birka during the 8th century is a thriving trading venue-

280
00:37:51.680 --> 00:37:56.920
- With goods and people from all parts of the then known world.

281
00:37:57.080 --> 00:38:03.320
It is not only trade, but also crafts, ie production of goods.

282
00:38:03.480 --> 00:38:08.440
And with all the people moving will also come new ideas -

283
00:38:08.600 --> 00:38:13.040
- New customs, new ways to do things and new religions.

284
00:38:13.200 --> 00:38:17.200
The Asa gods are starting to get competition for space.

285
00:38:23.520 --> 00:38:27.360
His name is Ansgar and is a monk who came from Germany -

286
00:38:27.520 --> 00:38:30.800
- To the Christian people in Birka.

287
00:38:30.960 --> 00:38:35.560
He is the first known missionary in Sweden.

288
00:38:35.720 --> 00:38:41.080
His arrival is the starting point for a change that cannot be stopped.

289
00:38:41.240 --> 00:38:45.240
Christianity will eventually replace asatron -

290
00:38:45.400 --> 00:38:49.400
- And when that happens, the Viking Age is over.

291
00:38:49.560 --> 00:38:56.240
But there we are not yet, because it should turn out that Ansgar's task is difficult.

292
00:38:56.400 --> 00:39:01.320
Ansgar is the first missionary in Sweden, which we know of.

293
00:39:01.480 --> 00:39:07.440
He had pretty big problems with Christian Swear.

294
00:39:10.040 --> 00:39:15.120
But Ansgar is stubborn and makes several attempts to establish a congregation.

295
00:39:22.000 --> 00:39:25.800
You let him mission in peace.

296
00:39:25.960 --> 00:39:30.960
Probably to keep up with the mighty Christian kingdoms in Europe.

297
00:39:31.120 --> 00:39:34.320
It is simply good for the business.

298
00:39:36.720 --> 00:39:39.720
The Vikings are practically laid.

299
00:39:40.600 --> 00:39:45.160
And maybe you are not so worried about the competition either.

300
00:39:45.320 --> 00:39:48.360
A god more or less.

301
00:39:49.520 --> 00:39:53.360
But despite its stubbornness, Ansgar has no great success.

302
00:39:53.520 --> 00:39:58.080
Asatron continues to be dominant.

303
00:39:58.240 --> 00:40:03.720
Asatron was strong and was not only practiced in Gamla Uppsala and Uppåkra.

304
00:40:03.880 --> 00:40:09.840
Throughout Scandinavia there were cult places where they were blotted to the gods.

305
00:40:10.000 --> 00:40:14.440
The word "grove" in a place name may indicate -

306
00:40:14.600 --> 00:40:19.360
- Vargerits took place there, on sacred trees.

307
00:40:23.520 --> 00:40:28.560
They were blotted regularly, ie
 one sacrificed to the pagan gods -

308
00:40:28.720 --> 00:40:34.000
- To have success in war and good harvests.

309
00:40:59.000 --> 00:41:04.560
Animals and humans are sacrificed, and with their blood you want to appease the gods.

310
00:41:04.720 --> 00:41:08.120
The bodies are hung in a holy grove.

311
00:41:26.000 --> 00:41:29.560
The cult sites were found all over the country.

312
00:41:29.720 --> 00:41:34.920
What was going on there was not just a matter for the men.
 On the contrary.

313
00:41:35.080 --> 00:41:39.320
Women could have important religious functions -

314
00:41:39.480 --> 00:41:42.600
–And act as a cult leader.

315
00:41:49.560 --> 00:41:56.000
Some women were considered to have the ability to put themselves in connection-

316
00:41:56.160 --> 00:42:00.480
–With the other world, where there were creatures and beings -

317
00:42:00.640 --> 00:42:05.480
- That could affect people's lives.

318
00:42:16.400 --> 00:42:21.000
It is clear that Viking -era women played an extremely important role -

319
00:42:21.160 --> 00:42:24.360
- In ancient cult, in magic.

320
00:42:24.520 --> 00:42:29.520
Völvor were called women who were specialized in getting contact -

321
00:42:29.680 --> 00:42:35.800
- With the other side, with the spirit world, to look into the future.

322
00:42:35.960 --> 00:42:40.040
They were both highly acted and feared.

323
00:42:40.640 --> 00:42:46.240
A vault can be likened to a shaman, a wizard woman.
 She could get in touch -

324
00:42:46.400 --> 00:42:52.800
- With the dead, look beyond the human eye.
 A kind of oracle.

325
00:43:00.840 --> 00:43:04.840
There is an interesting story in the ancient Nordic mythology -

326
00:43:05.000 --> 00:43:11.680
- If Odin has to awaken the killing of wobbles to gain knowledge about the future.

327
00:43:11.840 --> 00:43:17.200
Odin was the god of war and poetry, a master of sorcery -

328
00:43:17.400 --> 00:43:20.960
- But above all, Oden was the omniscient.

329
00:43:21.120 --> 00:43:26.520
Yet he had to raise ordinary deadly women -

330
00:43:26.680 --> 00:43:31.880
- To get hold of a knowledge they had, but he was missing.

331
00:43:32.040 --> 00:43:36.080
The woman knew more than the greatest god Oden.

332
00:43:45.080 --> 00:43:49.480
The stories depicting women with this ability -

333
00:43:49.640 --> 00:43:52.560
–As often recorded by Christian-

334
00:43:52.720 --> 00:43:56.160
- And they are not always positively produced.

335
00:43:56.320 --> 00:43:59.880
On the contrary, they are often badly liked.

336
00:44:00.040 --> 00:44:03.400
But there are reasons to doubt these information.

337
00:44:03.560 --> 00:44:07.400
A new belief comes easily in conflict with the old one.

338
00:44:37.640 --> 00:44:43.840
Here at the height, on Frösön in Jämtland, was an important place in the Viking Age.

339
00:44:44.000 --> 00:44:49.560
Here, a trade route from Norway passed, through Hälsingland to Birka.

340
00:44:50.800 --> 00:44:56.360
But it was probably not primarily trading you devoted to here at the height.

341
00:45:12.400 --> 00:45:16.680
Since the 13th century, Frösö church has been here.

342
00:45:16.840 --> 00:45:20.720
In 1984, a rebuild of the church began.

343
00:45:20.880 --> 00:45:26.080
When you started digging here at the choir, you found something interesting.

344
00:45:30.520 --> 00:45:34.720
In the soil layer under the altar, which belongs to the time before the church was built -

345
00:45:34.880 --> 00:45:40.440
- If you have found a birch stump, and around it lots of animal bones.

346
00:45:40.600 --> 00:45:46.200
There was also the human bone, which indicates that people may also have been sacrificed.

347
00:45:46.360 --> 00:45:50.600
This cult has probably been devoted to the god seed, or frej- -

348
00:45:50.760 --> 00:45:54.840
- For it is seeds that named the place Frösön.

349
00:45:58.240 --> 00:46:03.240
There are probably reasons why the church is built on top of the old cult site.

350
00:46:03.400 --> 00:46:09.040
Perhaps it is a way to mark that new thoughts have had to replace the old ones.

351
00:46:09.200 --> 00:46:13.560
That the belief in the Asa gods must leave room for faith in Jesus.

352
00:46:13.720 --> 00:46:17.720
Or on "The White Christ", as you say at this time.

353
00:46:24.040 --> 00:46:29.440
Now, in the early 9th century, Christianity is starting to enter the country-

354
00:46:29.600 --> 00:46:34.160
-differently.
 From the south, west and east.

355
00:46:34.320 --> 00:46:38.200
More and more people are taking impressions home from their travels -

356
00:46:38.360 --> 00:46:42.120
- And begins to confess to the new faith.

357
00:46:42.280 --> 00:46:46.480
It was a time of mixed religion and certainly great uncertainty.

358
00:46:46.640 --> 00:46:49.640
Some sacrificed to the old gods.

359
00:46:49.800 --> 00:46:53.520
Others took on the new Christian faith with only one God.

360
00:46:53.680 --> 00:46:56.720
In the eastern parts, Asatron dominated.

361
00:46:56.880 --> 00:47:02.040
In Västergötland, Christianity was attached as early as the 9th century.

362
00:47:15.880 --> 00:47:21.440
Here, next to Varnhem's medieval monastery church in Västergötland -

363
00:47:21.600 --> 00:47:28.040
- If you have found some of the first and oldest Christian graves in the country.

364
00:47:28.200 --> 00:47:31.600
They are from the beginning of the 900s.

365
00:47:37.920 --> 00:47:40.120
The findings in Varnhem clearly show:

366
00:47:40.280 --> 00:47:45.320
Christianity took root in Västergötland as early as the early 9th century-

367
00:47:45.480 --> 00:47:49.520
- Over it then spread to the rest of the country.

368
00:47:49.680 --> 00:47:52.680
It was a big step to change grave -

369
00:47:52.840 --> 00:47:56.400
- And start treating their dead in a completely different way.

370
00:47:56.560 --> 00:48:01.400
Probably it required a strong conviction to dare to take the step.

371
00:48:01.560 --> 00:48:04.200
They stopped cremate.

372
00:48:04.360 --> 00:48:08.560
The dead would be put unburned in the soil in east-west direction-

373
00:48:08.720 --> 00:48:12.600
–To to resurface on the outermost day -

374
00:48:12.760 --> 00:48:17.960
- With the face to the east, where the Lord would show up and judge the people.

375
00:48:21.920 --> 00:48:25.480
Religion came to Scandinavia in different ways.

376
00:48:25.640 --> 00:48:30.240
On the one hand, missionaries were sent out of England and Germany -

377
00:48:30.400 --> 00:48:35.880
- Along the Western Goths on their travels west with them priests.

378
00:48:36.040 --> 00:48:40.560
They wanted to become part of Western European Christian culture.

379
00:48:40.720 --> 00:48:45.320
They see the developed communities and meet the Christian culture -

380
00:48:45.480 --> 00:48:51.480
- And gets impressed, of course.
 They feel that this is the future.

381
00:49:13.640 --> 00:49:16.640
Near the early Christian graves -

382
00:49:16.800 --> 00:49:21.120
- The remains are found after one of Sweden's oldest known stone churches.

383
00:49:21.280 --> 00:49:28.080
It is from the 11th century.
 Building a church in stone was something completely new.

384
00:49:28.240 --> 00:49:33.280
This ruin shows that there was a very early Christian congregation -

385
00:49:33.440 --> 00:49:38.360
- As a living and thrived here in Varnhem.

386
00:49:38.520 --> 00:49:41.840
Adjacent to the church ground were found the remains -

387
00:49:42.000 --> 00:49:46.320
- After those who probably let the church build.

388
00:49:50.880 --> 00:49:53.120
North of the cemetery -

389
00:49:53.280 --> 00:49:57.480
- We found a wonderfully fine walled limestone chest with a women's skeleton.

390
00:49:57.640 --> 00:50:03.800
This grave also includes a run -carved tombstone, which has been on top.

391
00:50:03.960 --> 00:50:09.600
It is a Christian cross in the middle and a run loop around, where you can read:

392
00:50:09.760 --> 00:50:15.400
"Kättil made this stone after Kata, his wife, Torgil's sister."

393
00:50:15.560 --> 00:50:18.520
No ordinary people were buried that way.

394
00:50:18.680 --> 00:50:23.480
The design of the coffin shows that Kata belonged to the elite in society.

395
00:50:23.640 --> 00:50:28.480
The skeleton is very well preserved, so we can create a picture of -

396
00:50:28.640 --> 00:50:31.760
- How Kata looked like a living person.

397
00:50:32.760 --> 00:50:36.880
She was 160 centimeters tall, 30-35 years old when she died -

398
00:50:37.040 --> 00:50:41.880
- And from the shape of the skull, her appearance can be reconstructed.

399
00:50:42.040 --> 00:50:48.280
Through DNA we can also determine that she was blonde and blue -eyed.

400
00:50:53.680 --> 00:50:59.320
Probably Kata and Kättil, or their family, built the stone church.

401
00:50:59.480 --> 00:51:02.720
One of Sweden's first.

402
00:51:02.880 --> 00:51:09.360
Such a demonstration of power and wealth must have known the king.

403
00:51:09.520 --> 00:51:11.520
Olof Skötkonung.

404
00:51:18.320 --> 00:51:22.520
Olof is usually counted as Sweden's first Christian king.

405
00:51:22.680 --> 00:51:27.600
With him, Christianity takes another big step into our country.

406
00:51:27.760 --> 00:51:33.040
But for a while, the Asatron and the Viking Age will bite.

407
00:51:33.200 --> 00:51:37.440
Olof Skötkonung lived at the same time as Kata and Kättil-

408
00:51:37.600 --> 00:51:43.520
- And he was baptized in Husaby just a few miles from Varnhem.

409
00:51:43.680 --> 00:51:50.040
We can arrange that Olof has existed through the coins he left behind.

410
00:51:53.800 --> 00:51:59.040
Olof was inspired by England and took English coin master to Sigtuna -

411
00:51:59.200 --> 00:52:03.920
- To characterize coins.
 On the coins it says "Olof, Rex Sveorum".

412
00:52:04.080 --> 00:52:08.240
It means "Olof, the King of the Swers".

413
00:52:08.400 --> 00:52:12.400
And these were the very first Swedish coins.

414
00:52:12.560 --> 00:52:16.320
Olof Skötkonung is the first Swedish king -

415
00:52:16.480 --> 00:52:20.120
- Which controls both Svealand and Götaland.

416
00:52:20.280 --> 00:52:24.560
He had a ruling seat in the newly formed city of Sigtuna -

417
00:52:24.720 --> 00:52:28.840
- That was the new hub of the Mälar area, after Birka.

418
00:52:39.160 --> 00:52:41.560
Sigtuna is a Christian city.

419
00:52:41.720 --> 00:52:47.080
People here move from near and far to shop and live.

420
00:52:47.240 --> 00:52:50.440
Half of the residents are immigrant.

421
00:52:58.080 --> 00:53:03.920
Olof also established contacts east.
 In order to strengthen their power base -

422
00:53:04.080 --> 00:53:09.200
- He built alliances and networks to trade.

423
00:53:09.360 --> 00:53:15.440
Marriage between influential families was an effective shortcut.

424
00:53:18.680 --> 00:53:24.080
This young woman is called Ingegerd, and she is Olof Skötkonung's daughter.

425
00:53:46.880 --> 00:53:53.280
She marries a king from Rus, where slaves and Viking Estatles live.

426
00:53:53.440 --> 00:53:58.720
And from there she will affect Europe's history.

427
00:53:58.880 --> 00:54:04.040
At the age of 20 she is married away, as a result of the good conditions-

428
00:54:04.200 --> 00:54:09.040
- As has long been between the Ruskish and Scandinavia.

429
00:54:09.200 --> 00:54:12.600
She then becomes a prince, first in Novgorod -

430
00:54:12.760 --> 00:54:17.160
- And then throughout the state, which also includes Kiev.

431
00:54:22.000 --> 00:54:25.000
As a prince in Kiev, she gets three daughters -

432
00:54:25.160 --> 00:54:31.040
- As she marries into the royal houses in France, Norway and Hungary.

433
00:54:31.200 --> 00:54:37.560
Her descendants are long in power around the medieval Europe.

434
00:54:37.720 --> 00:54:40.760
One of her sons founded the Tsar family -

435
00:54:40.920 --> 00:54:44.520
- As in Russia for a long time.

436
00:54:44.680 --> 00:54:47.680
Ingegerd gets great influence -

437
00:54:47.840 --> 00:54:52.760
-And is one of Europe's main characters during the 11th century.

438
00:55:05.720 --> 00:55:09.720
Olof was a skilled power person.

439
00:55:09.880 --> 00:55:15.880
And he did what he could to recruit new souls to Christ.

440
00:55:21.680 --> 00:55:27.040
But Olof's attempt to convert the swearing is not going well.

441
00:55:27.200 --> 00:55:33.160
He tried to burn the temple in Gamla Uppsala, but failed.

442
00:55:33.320 --> 00:55:36.880
He may promise not to mission more in the Uppsala area -

443
00:55:37.040 --> 00:55:40.240
- And he moves back to Västergötland.

444
00:55:40.400 --> 00:55:44.440
There things are going better.
 In Skara, Olof founded a bishop's seat -

445
00:55:44.600 --> 00:55:49.040
- As is the oldest preserved diocese in Sweden.

446
00:56:00.000 --> 00:56:06.600
Christianity has come to a halt - and is now starting to take over.

447
00:56:08.360 --> 00:56:11.760
But not really everywhere.

448
00:56:13.120 --> 00:56:18.880
For the Swans in Mälardalen, asatron does not want to give up asatron completely.

449
00:56:23.480 --> 00:56:29.960
A pagan king is still said to rule in Old Uppsala in the late 1000s.

450
00:56:32.040 --> 00:56:34.440
Blot-Sven.

451
00:56:34.600 --> 00:56:40.040
In Gamla Uppsala, they continued to be far ahead in the 11th century.

452
00:56:40.200 --> 00:56:46.320
According to the sources, Blot-Sven is the last pagan king in our country.

453
00:56:46.480 --> 00:56:51.040
But Blot-Sven is not long like king over the Swans.

454
00:56:51.200 --> 00:56:55.200
After only a few years, the Christian Inge comes to Old Uppsala-

455
00:56:55.360 --> 00:56:58.760
- From Västergötland with his men.

456
00:57:07.600 --> 00:57:12.560
When Inge comes, he burns the farm and lets the dead Blot-Sven.

457
00:57:16.680 --> 00:57:19.760
It is said that Inge is taking power over the Svearna -

458
00:57:19.920 --> 00:57:25.200
- And that he finally faces Christianity as a religion.

459
00:57:31.080 --> 00:57:36.280
Blot-Sven is the last pagan king in our country.

460
00:57:36.440 --> 00:57:39.560
After that we only have Christian kings.

461
00:57:40.640 --> 00:57:46.040
When Christianity victories, it means that the Viking Age is definitely over -

462
00:57:46.200 --> 00:57:49.200
- And the Middle Ages can begin.

463
00:57:53.320 --> 00:57:57.560
Sweden will change and become a new kingdom.

464
00:57:57.720 --> 00:58:03.400
The kings become powerful, and the new faith gives people a new meaning -

465
00:58:03.560 --> 00:58:06.520
- And the opportunity for an eternal life.

466
00:58:06.680 --> 00:58:10.400
God gives and God takes.

467
00:58:16.120 --> 00:58:20.600
