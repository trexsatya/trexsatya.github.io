1
00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:18.480
C.Teletext.urfjarranhallå!

2
00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:27.000
Hell...

3
00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:31.640
- Curse.
 Gubbfan from Kronofogden.
 –Satan.

4
00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:33.800
C.Teletext.urfjarranhallå!

5
00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:36.880
You know what to do.

6
00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:41.560
Hello!

7
00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:10.600
Hello!
 Leif, I see you.

8
00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:20.720
Oh ... I was looking for a snuff box.

9
00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:27.400
-I found it.
 -Open!

10
00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:39.800
Excuse me, can you hold this one?
 Now you have been served, Leif.

11
00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:46.440
We will have the money within a week.
 Otherwise we make a foreclosure of the house -

12
00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:52.160
- And seizes valuables that achieve the sum.

13
00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:56.320
Wait!
 18 390 SEK ...

14
00:01:56.480 --> 00:02:00.520
You must have added a zero or two too much.

15
00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:07.840
No, Leif.
 This time it does not work to tip-Exa over the last digit.

16
00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:11.200
We will have the money within a week.

17
00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:16.840
You don't want it to go like last time?

18
00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:21.160
Do you miss the gun, which we seized?

19
00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:26.320
A week, Leif.
 You have forgotten a button.
 Good luck!

20
00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:29.800
Damn.
 - Billy!

21
00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:33.000
Billy!

22
00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:40.680
- Has he gone?
 -Yes.

23
00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:44.240
Fy fuck.
 Now it's bad, Billy.

24
00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:50.760
- But huh, 18,390 bucks?!
 - We have a week on us to pay.

25
00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:58.080
- Then they come here and empty the kitchen.
 -Hell!
 Imagine if they take the computer.

26
00:02:58.240 --> 00:03:02.240
Is that the one you are thinking about?
 The damn dumb can!

27
00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:09.600
I'm so tired of that computer.
 We have a car worth several thousand.

28
00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:17.320
What if they take it!
 They strangle us from the kitchen.
 We are starving, for the hell!

29
00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:22.480
You are too fat to go to the store four kilometers.

30
00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:28.600
There is only one thing to do.
 We get to pick up the dad's old home burner.

31
00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:35.560
- Is it so damn smart?
 - You can't decide what is smart.

32
00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:40.840
You have been sitting at the computer and emptied the brain of brain cells.

33
00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:47.920
It's like living with a vegetable.
 No, it's just driving.

34
00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:54.440
And take and shower, for fuck.
 It smells like pigs about you.
 Yuk!

35
00:04:56.840 --> 00:05:01.480
- Yeah, that went well.
 -Good?

36
00:05:01.640 --> 00:05:06.800
We have sold for SEK 400 ... not so damn good.

37
00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:10.960
The liquor tastes for fuck anal cavity.

38
00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:17.440
People rather drink themselves full of lubricants and gasoline.

39
00:05:18.600 --> 00:05:23.680
I know.
 We may make a new recipe.

40
00:05:29.160 --> 00:05:32.120
But what hell!

41
00:05:40.320 --> 00:05:45.880
What the hell are you doing?
 You would be here in a week.

42
00:05:46.040 --> 00:05:49.560
I prepare for the foreclosure.

43
00:05:49.720 --> 00:05:53.120
It was a real route 740 ...

44
00:05:53.280 --> 00:05:58.680
But you can probably get rid of five cardboard for it anyway.

45
00:05:58.840 --> 00:06:05.760
I'm thinking of buying it later.
 Turn it into an epatractor.

46
00:06:05.920 --> 00:06:10.360
So the boy has something to drive around this summer.

47
00:06:10.520 --> 00:06:16.080
Or you burn up the shit and drive it into a lake.

48
00:06:16.240 --> 00:06:22.680
- You bastard, give a damn in Volvon!
 - Snack, little Leif ...

49
00:06:22.840 --> 00:06:28.960
Both you and I know that you will never fix the money.

50
00:06:29.120 --> 00:06:35.520
Just as good that you say goodbye to the old harness.
 Viewed in a week.

51
00:06:46.040 --> 00:06:50.440
-What do we do now?
 -Nothing.

52
00:06:50.600 --> 00:06:56.600
They have been after us since we got out of my dad's purse.
 A stamp in the neck.

53
00:06:56.760 --> 00:07:03.360
-I can not take it.
 I give up.
 - Wait ... something we have to do.

54
00:07:03.520 --> 00:07:08.080
- It's going well.
 -Good?

55
00:07:08.240 --> 00:07:14.160
Looks like something I do is going well.
 I tried to fix a wife ...

56
00:07:14.320 --> 00:07:19.720
... I tried to lower blood pressure, I tried to join the hunting team ...

57
00:07:19.880 --> 00:07:26.600
Nothing goes well, Billy.
 Everything I do goes to hell.
 Yuk!

58
00:07:26.760 --> 00:07:29.840
This body can no longer cope.

59
00:08:05.400 --> 00:08:08.760
Leif ... Hello, Leif!

60
00:08:15.080 --> 00:08:20.280
What the hell are you doing?
 It is six o'clock at night.

61
00:08:20.440 --> 00:08:27.480
I have cooked a new recipe.
 Now damn!
 Now I have got something good.

62
00:08:29.600 --> 00:08:31.840
Taste!

63
00:08:36.400 --> 00:08:41.040
Screw me!
 You're a fucking genius, Billy.

64
00:08:41.200 --> 00:08:44.880
I said it would settle.

65
00:08:50.560 --> 00:08:57.120
It's the best thing I've been drinking since my father was on the move.
 Fy fuck ...

66
00:08:57.280 --> 00:09:04.600
Do you want to stay and rot, or should we get rid of the parasites?

67
00:09:04.760 --> 00:09:10.680
-Here we go!
 I can get up myself.
 - come.

68
00:10:07.320 --> 00:10:10.520
Fy hell ...

69
00:10:10.680 --> 00:10:16.240
-Fuck off!
 YES!
 - You were the worst alchemist!

70
00:10:16.400 --> 00:10:20.480
Billy Öhman - "Liquer Lord of the Sörbäcken Forests".

71
00:10:20.640 --> 00:10:26.160
Soon they will be allowed to shut down Systembolaget down the village.

72
00:10:26.320 --> 00:10:32.200
- How much did we get together?
 –13 000. 13,000, Leif!

73
00:10:34.160 --> 00:10:40.280
Fuck off.
 Another round, we can pay off the damn crown bailiff.

74
00:10:40.440 --> 00:10:46.520
Do you know something?
 If there is money left, you can buy Playstation 4.

75
00:10:46.680 --> 00:10:52.480
-You're joking?
 You must not have fun, Leif.
 -I'm not kidding.

76
00:10:52.640 --> 00:10:56.600
And then you get your wisdom tooth yours.

77
00:10:56.760 --> 00:11:02.240
-Is it true?
 -I never lie.
 Now we go to bed.

78
00:11:04.520 --> 00:11:06.840
Alchemist.

79
00:11:39.440 --> 00:11:42.480
C.Teletext.urfjarranodod Morning.
 Time for local news.

80
00:11:42.640 --> 00:11:46.720
C.Teletext.urfjarrani Sörbyn municipality has taken off a homemade liquor epidemic.

81
00:11:46.880 --> 00:11:49.960
C.Teletext.urfjarran Police take this very seriously -

82
00:11:50.120 --> 00:11:55.040
C.Teletext.urfjarran - when the crime is not just about home burning.

83
00:11:55.200 --> 00:11:58.600
C.Teletext.urfjarranspriten contains methanol.

84
00:11:58.760 --> 00:12:04.560
C.Teletext.urfjarranalla who consumed the liquor has been hit by temporary blindness -

85
00:12:04.720 --> 00:12:11.080
C.Teletext.urfjarran - and Sörbyn Hospital is now overloaded by people being cared for ...

86
00:12:11.240 --> 00:12:14.840
Billy, Billy!

87
00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:18.440
Billy ... Billy ...

88
00:12:18.600 --> 00:12:23.560
- Billy!
 Billy!
 - Yes, I'm here, Leif.

89
00:12:23.720 --> 00:12:29.160
-Help!
 I'm blind like a mole.
 - Law, Leif!

90
00:12:29.320 --> 00:12:34.640
-I can not see anything.
 Let me go!
 - Law, calm!

91
00:12:34.800 --> 00:12:39.960
Do not you understand?
 The body has started to put on me.

92
00:12:40.120 --> 00:12:44.760
First the vision, then the legs start to quit and then I lie there ...

93
00:12:44.920 --> 00:12:47.880
-It's over.
 -Take it easy.

94
00:12:48.040 --> 00:12:53.200
-I'm going to die!
 Its over!
 -Quiet...

95
00:12:53.360 --> 00:12:57.080
Oh, calm down!
 Oh my God.

96
00:12:58.080 --> 00:13:03.120
- Release that.
 - You let me go!

97
00:13:03.280 --> 00:13:08.680
- Take the rifle.
 Take the rifle, Billy!
 -Okay.

98
00:13:08.840 --> 00:13:13.920
Tell me the pipe at my head.
 I do not want to live anymore.
 Press off!

99
00:13:14.080 --> 00:13:20.680
- But, God cursed.
 Shoot me!
 - Okay, it was the liquor, Leif!

100
00:13:21.680 --> 00:13:28.480
I looked at the news.
 Half the village has become blind.
 It was my fault.

101
00:13:29.480 --> 00:13:34.880
Your bastard.
 You've made your own brother blind.

102
00:13:35.880 --> 00:13:40.840
Now you have to push me to the hospital.
 Come ...

103
00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:43.600
Billy!

104
00:13:50.440 --> 00:13:56.600
- What did you put in the fucking home cooler?
 - I took a little bit of everything possible ...

105
00:13:56.760 --> 00:14:02.040
- Not from the can in the caravan, well?
 -Yes.

106
00:14:02.200 --> 00:14:07.760
Cursed!
 It's methanol, your fucking chicken brain!

107
00:14:07.920 --> 00:14:14.680
- It is strange that I am blind!
 - I tried to help.
 Soft!

108
00:14:14.840 --> 00:14:20.720
Soft?
 Yes, I can be soft now that I look like a handicapped.

109
00:14:20.880 --> 00:14:25.040
Good that I don't have to see your damned Nylle.

110
00:14:25.200 --> 00:14:30.240
Now the father had been damn proud.
 Congratulations.

111
00:14:39.760 --> 00:14:45.720
So there ... it will take a week before the antidote had its effect.

112
00:14:45.880 --> 00:14:49.080
But you will get the sight back.

113
00:14:49.240 --> 00:14:55.080
I want you to wear these to make your eyes re -adjust.

114
00:14:55.240 --> 00:14:58.560
So good!
 Then you were done.

115
00:14:59.960 --> 00:15:02.040
Thanks.

116
00:15:02.200 --> 00:15:07.480
The person who sold the alcohol to you, what did it look like?

117
00:15:07.640 --> 00:15:13.480
-No clue.
 - It's hard to remember.

118
00:15:13.640 --> 00:15:18.800
If you get in touch again, call me.
 It is a very serious crime.

119
00:15:18.960 --> 00:15:23.480
- Yes, we call.
 -Thanks.

120
00:15:30.320 --> 00:15:34.520
Thanks, Billy.
 Good work.
 Yuk!

121
00:15:36.840 --> 00:15:43.040
Take it easy, Leif.
 It is that way.
 Follow me, just ...

122
00:15:51.480 --> 00:15:58.680
Nämen Hello, boys!
 I just wondered if you tried to throw away again.

123
00:15:58.840 --> 00:16:06.800
Nämen, Leif, what handsome glasses!
 They look really good on you.

124
00:16:08.120 --> 00:16:15.120
Now it's been a week, and we still haven't seen any money.

125
00:16:15.280 --> 00:16:21.240
- So now I want the car keys.
 - Take it a little quiet with the picture keys.

126
00:16:32.960 --> 00:16:38.520
–13,000 SEK.
 - Boys, boys ...

127
00:16:39.560 --> 00:16:43.360
You have gone hard on the savings box.

128
00:16:43.520 --> 00:16:48.640
But it is taken five thousand, so I want the car keys.

129
00:16:48.800 --> 00:16:53.120
Please, whatever but not the car.

130
00:16:53.280 --> 00:16:58.400
You have taken stuff under the table before.
 Either you take the car -

131
00:16:58.560 --> 00:17:04.320
- Or you take something under the table and write off the debt.

132
00:17:04.480 --> 00:17:10.520
- But ... what would it be, then?
 - High pressure washer ...

133
00:17:10.680 --> 00:17:19.000
... or the computer upstairs.
 It's an old Macintosh.

134
00:17:19.160 --> 00:17:23.440
Or Mulltoan ...

135
00:17:23.600 --> 00:17:28.600
- This, then?
 - The caravan?

136
00:17:28.760 --> 00:17:34.200
-Yes.
 The wife wants to get a caravan.
 --Leif, I don't think ...

137
00:17:34.360 --> 00:17:39.840
Wow, what a great idea!
 It's super nice.

138
00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:45.040
- It rolls on any good.
 –Fan, Leif ...

139
00:17:45.200 --> 00:17:53.040
Right.
 Good, Billy, that you reminded me.
 The keys we have lost ..

140
00:17:53.200 --> 00:17:56.680
... but you arrange that.

141
00:17:56.840 --> 00:18:02.120
- I might surprise her.
 - It's damn nice.

142
00:18:02.280 --> 00:18:05.960
Do you know what, boys?
 We drive it!

143
00:18:08.200 --> 00:18:12.600
-Write under here.
 - I pull on a small crow.

144
00:18:12.760 --> 00:18:16.080
Perfect!
 Then you are debt free.

145
00:18:26.720 --> 00:18:31.720
Hello hi.
 I know who sold all the full spirits.

146
00:18:31.880 --> 00:18:36.520
It is a man with a caravan that runs in the hooks.

147
00:18:38.040 --> 00:18:42.080
Yes, it matches the description.
 That's him.

148
