1
00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:16.160
Now let's see ... Here she stands.

2
00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:23.200
-Hello.
 -Hello.
 Welcome into the car.

3
00:00:23.360 --> 00:00:27.200
-How's it going?
 You're ready?
 -Yes.

4
00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:31.360
-Let's go.
 Against Knutby.
 –Yes.

5
00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:39.480
<b> <c.Cyan> In this series we meet young </b> <b> <c.Cyan> who grew up with a religious belief - </b>

6
00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:44.520
<b> <c.Cyan> - they have not chosen themselves.
 A religion </b> <b> <c.Cyan> they received from their parents - </b>

7
00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:47.840
<b> <c.Cyan> –Ach as they have been ill. </b>

8
00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:53.960
<b> <c.Cyan> Now they come forward and give voice </b> <b> <c.Cyan> to the child they once were. </b>

9
00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:59.760
<b> <c.Cyan> All children who grow up </b> <b> <c.Cyan> In Religious Home not bad - </b>

10
00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:06.400
<b> <c.Cyan> - But now it is about those who have done </b> <b> <c.Cyan> it.
 Now we're going to listen to them. </b>

11
00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:33.200
Knutby Filadelfia and everything that happened there-

12
00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:39.360
- Was on all flyers and in all news broadcasts.

13
00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:44.560
Still, no one intervened and did anything for your children.

14
00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:49.680
- What are you thinking about it today?
 - It has made me quite sad.

15
00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:54.080
Why were there so many who saw, and did nothing?

16
00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:58.400
I felt like society ...

17
00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:01.480
... didn't want to know about us.

18
00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:07.800
When I greeted adults on the street, they could turn their heads away.

19
00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:10.200
<b> <c.Cyan> Knutby Filadelfia. </b>

20
00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:14.960
<b> <c.Cyan> What happened there, in a Christian </b> <b> <c.Cyan> congregation in the countryside in Uppland - </b>

21
00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:19.240
<b> <c.Cyan> - Bleed one of our time </b> <b> <c.Cyan> most guarded news events. </b>

22
00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:23.080
A 26-year-old woman was arrested today, suspected of involvement in the murder-

23
00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:26.360
-On the 23-year-old woman who was shot dead in Knutby.

24
00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:31.000
- The pastor in Knutby was arrested today.
 - Pastor Helge Fossmo acknowledged ...

25
00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:34.840
... that he was involved in the murder and attempted murder.

26
00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:39.760
<b> <c.Cyan> But despite all the flyers then </b> <b> <c.Cyan> the congregation was not closed down. </b>

27
00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:44.640
<b> <c.Cyan> instead took additional </b> <b> <c.Cyan> 15 years of horror at - </b>

28
00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:48.200
<b> <c.Cyan> - which did not end until 2020 - </b>

29
00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:52.320
<b> <c.Cyan> - When the highest leader, </b> <b> <c.Cyan> the so -called
 Kristi's bride - </b>

30
00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:57.360
<b> <c.Cyan> - Kunde is dropped for the abuse </b> <b> <c.Cyan> She exposed parishioners to. </b>

31
00:02:57.520 --> 00:03:03.760
<b> <c.Cyan> In the middle of everything that happened there, </b> <b> <c.Cyan> in the middle of the storm that was Knutby - </b>

32
00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:07.640
<b> <c.Cyan> - Growing Linnéa up. </b>

33
00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:13.760
When I contacted you and we decided to make this trip together -

34
00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:19.240
- There was one thing you wanted to do.
 Should you tell us where we are going?

35
00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:24.640
We will meet Sofi, who has been a teacher at the school and who is the principal now.

36
00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:31.040
- At Knutbyskolan?
 -Yes.
 She has always been there.

37
00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:39.760
How did religion, which your parents chose, affected your childhood?

38
00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:45.200
It affected me very much, all my life.

39
00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:48.520
It was all my worldview -

40
00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:53.840
– That life on earth was a small starting distance to eternity -

41
00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:59.640
- And that what happened here was quite pointless.

42
00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:06.480
What teachings in the congregation were scary for you when you were little?

43
00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:09.960
It was about hell.

44
00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:15.520
If you got wrong in this life, you could end up in hell.

45
00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:22.400
It scared me most, that my mother was doomed to end up in hell.

46
00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:28.040
When talking to a man as if it were a demon-

47
00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:32.800
- As if the person had been taken over by a demon ...

48
00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:39.440
- It was very nasty.
 - How did it affect you?

49
00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:43.560
I was really scared for me to happen too.

50
00:04:43.720 --> 00:04:47.640
So I became more and more loyal -

51
00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:54.520
–And afraid my thoughts would do something that led me -

52
00:04:54.680 --> 00:04:59.000
- So I was also taken by a demon.

53
00:04:59.160 --> 00:05:03.720
- Was there someone you could talk to?
 -No.

54
00:05:03.880 --> 00:05:09.280
I didn't know where to turn.
 No one contacted me.

55
00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:16.120
<b> <c.Cyan> only when the congregation collapsed </b> <b> <c.Cyan> it was discovered - </b>

56
00:05:16.280 --> 00:05:19.920
<b> <c.Cyan> —Hur The Children in Knutby Filadelfia </b> <b> <C.Cyan> had it. </b>

57
00:05:20.080 --> 00:05:26.400
<b> <c.Cyan> Only then did you understand what religious </b> <b> <c.Cyan> performance world they lived with. </b>

58
00:05:26.560 --> 00:05:32.320
<b> <c.Cyan> Now Linnéa wants to know why </b> <b> <c.Cyan> no one at school could help her. </b>

59
00:05:34.640 --> 00:05:38.680
Here is Knutbyskolan.
 Here you went from ...?

60
00:05:38.840 --> 00:05:43.440
From preschool class to six - seven years.

61
00:05:47.800 --> 00:05:52.120
In front.
 Does it feel okay?
 Let's go.

62
00:05:57.920 --> 00:06:00.640
Here it is.
 Look here.

63
00:06:00.800 --> 00:06:04.680
- Hi, Linnéa.
 -Hello.

64
00:06:07.960 --> 00:06:10.920
Here we can be.

65
00:06:12.560 --> 00:06:18.280
- Do you recognize yourself?
 -Yes.
 It was my classroom in one.

66
00:06:18.440 --> 00:06:22.560
- I brought me some stuff.
 -Okay.

67
00:06:22.720 --> 00:06:27.040
- A lot of old books.
 -How exiting.

68
00:06:27.200 --> 00:06:30.120
<c.YELLOW> Anna: Wow.

69
00:06:30.280 --> 00:06:37.760
I tried to see ... there must be some track if I tried to tell you something.

70
00:06:37.920 --> 00:06:42.840
It would be very interesting if you want to share it.

71
00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:47.920
After all, we have not been able to ask the right questions or see the right things.

72
00:06:48.080 --> 00:06:54.280
When it became known how it had been -

73
00:06:54.440 --> 00:07:01.600
- It was known as if many puzzle pieces, which existed as a feeling ...

74
00:07:01.760 --> 00:07:06.680
That it was confirmed, what we have tried to ask about -

75
00:07:06.840 --> 00:07:12.400
- What we have tried to highlight, what we have tried to work against.

76
00:07:12.560 --> 00:07:19.600
It was much worse than we ever could have imagined.

77
00:07:19.760 --> 00:07:27.680
I've found ... I've drawn pretty detailed and written everything.

78
00:07:27.840 --> 00:07:33.320
But then it's a picture here ... I know what it is.

79
00:07:33.480 --> 00:07:40.400
I saw things at night when I was little that I thought were demons.

80
00:07:40.560 --> 00:07:46.960
- So this is a demon?
 -Yes.
 Maybe a kind of machining.

81
00:07:47.120 --> 00:07:50.920
- The one here also looks a bit nasty.
 -Yes.

82
00:07:51.080 --> 00:07:56.080
Do you remember the little Linnéa who drew that picture?

83
00:07:56.240 --> 00:07:59.640
What did you need at that moment?

84
00:07:59.800 --> 00:08:05.240
I didn't tell anyone, not even to mom and dad.

85
00:08:05.400 --> 00:08:09.000
I had told my friends -

86
00:08:09.160 --> 00:08:12.960
- I saw a demon, and they had laughed.

87
00:08:13.120 --> 00:08:18.160
Then I decided to never tell it again.

88
00:08:18.320 --> 00:08:21.280
It was well...

89
00:08:21.440 --> 00:08:26.240
Just that, I had written about evil spirits too.

90
00:08:26.400 --> 00:08:32.680
It is a bit strange when you are nine and write a fairy tale about an evil spirit.

91
00:08:32.840 --> 00:08:36.960
It was probably my way of telling -

92
00:08:37.120 --> 00:08:41.680
- Through pictures and text, when I didn't dare tell anyone.

93
00:08:41.840 --> 00:08:49.080
I don't know what I needed, but it affected me very much.

94
00:08:49.240 --> 00:08:52.240
If any teacher had asked you -

95
00:08:52.400 --> 00:08:58.160
- Why you had written about evil spirits, what would have happened then?

96
00:08:58.320 --> 00:09:04.040
I do not know.
 It could have opened to some call.

97
00:09:04.200 --> 00:09:10.200
I wish I got help with not being so scared.

98
00:09:10.360 --> 00:09:15.920
I wish someone had asked it.
 But then you have to have that knowledge.

99
00:09:16.080 --> 00:09:19.160
You can think that it is a rabbit.

100
00:09:19.320 --> 00:09:24.360
Today it was thought that it was the summer shadow, the children's program.

101
00:09:24.520 --> 00:09:31.480
All young adults we interview, who have been children in religious contexts -

102
00:09:31.640 --> 00:09:34.920
- Calls a lot about demon horror.

103
00:09:35.080 --> 00:09:40.280
How do you think you as a teacher, if you see such a drawing ...

104
00:09:40.440 --> 00:09:44.480
The drawing symbolizes a deep horror at Linnéa -

105
00:09:44.640 --> 00:09:48.080
- As she has with her here to school.

106
00:09:48.240 --> 00:09:55.400
We have too little knowledge, especially if you are not at all believers yourself.

107
00:09:55.560 --> 00:10:01.280
When I see this ... if I had had the little Linnéa here now -

108
00:10:01.440 --> 00:10:06.480
- So I wanted to give you a big hug and said:

109
00:10:06.640 --> 00:10:11.280
"Be careful with you. Nothing's your fault."

110
00:10:11.440 --> 00:10:18.960
That is a problem ... If I was your teacher and you said something to me -

111
00:10:19.120 --> 00:10:23.840
–As so awful that I understood that you felt bad about it -

112
00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:29.440
- I had to talk to your parents.

113
00:10:29.600 --> 00:10:34.840
Here we would need to have some little one ... clause -

114
00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:39.080
- That if you think ... there is not.

115
00:10:39.240 --> 00:10:44.160
If you had been beaten, I would have been able to skip your parents -

116
00:10:44.320 --> 00:10:48.800
–And you would have received help in a different way.

117
00:10:48.960 --> 00:10:54.840
But there is not such a variant, unless you are physically abused.

118
00:10:55.000 --> 00:11:00.640
The mental abuse, or control, we have forgotten.

119
00:11:00.800 --> 00:11:05.480
You have tried to send small messages to the world outside the congregation.

120
00:11:05.640 --> 00:11:10.440
What do you want to say to teachers who may hear this now -

121
00:11:10.600 --> 00:11:15.320
- So have students who may be in the situation you were in?

122
00:11:15.480 --> 00:11:19.600
I wish they will snap up the signals -

123
00:11:19.760 --> 00:11:26.640
-And not just waving them or think that it's not that serious -

124
00:11:26.800 --> 00:11:32.200
- Understand that it is to stretch a hand.

125
00:11:32.360 --> 00:11:36.760
That you follow it up, I really wish.

126
00:11:46.040 --> 00:11:50.280
- Did you have religious freedom as a child?
 -No absolutely not.

127
00:11:50.440 --> 00:11:54.160
There was only one religion.

128
00:11:54.320 --> 00:11:57.240
Did you have free thought?

129
00:11:57.400 --> 00:12:02.160
No, I thought God could hear my thoughts.

130
00:12:02.320 --> 00:12:07.200
It felt like I was completely transparent.

131
00:12:07.360 --> 00:12:12.680
Did you have the right to think and think what you wanted, say?

132
00:12:12.840 --> 00:12:19.320
No, you got clear instructions.
 So no, I couldn't.

133
00:12:19.480 --> 00:12:26.160
You were told that you were thinking wrong, and how to think.

134
00:12:26.320 --> 00:12:32.600
What would you like to say to children who are in the same situation as you were?

135
00:12:32.760 --> 00:12:35.080
Hold on.

136
00:12:35.240 --> 00:12:38.960
-Hold on?
 - mm.

137
00:12:40.520 --> 00:12:47.240
<b> <c.Cyan> This is Linnéa's story, but </b> <b> <c.Cyan> it is similar to the other's stories. </b>

138
00:12:47.400 --> 00:12:49.880
<b> <c.Cyan> especially one thing goes again: </b>

139
00:12:50.040 --> 00:12:55.400
<b> <c.Cyan> There was never anyone outside the </b> <b> <c.Cyan> religious context that saw. </b>

140
00:12:55.560 --> 00:13:01.920
<b> <c.Cyan> There was never anyone who heard what </b> <b> <c.Cyan> the children then had to tell you about. </b>

141
00:13:03.720 --> 00:13:11.520
Has any adult outside the congregation asked you how you feel with your faith?

142
00:13:11.680 --> 00:13:14.920
No, it is not.

143
00:13:15.080 --> 00:13:21.400
I wish more adults put their foot down and say away.

144
00:13:21.560 --> 00:13:25.320
It wasn't like the school staff later in life -

145
00:13:25.480 --> 00:13:30.480
- No knew what was going on at home.
 I wasn't quiet about it either.

146
00:13:30.640 --> 00:13:37.240
I told my teachers what was happening, but they never said.

147
00:13:38.960 --> 00:13:42.640
I wish the school had been more helpful.

148
00:13:42.800 --> 00:13:46.160
It is probably the best arena.

149
00:13:46.320 --> 00:13:49.920
School should be a free zone for children -

150
00:13:50.080 --> 00:13:54.360
- Where they don't have to convert their classmates.

151
00:13:54.520 --> 00:13:58.440
The time I was talking about Jesus for the class -

152
00:13:58.600 --> 00:14:02.520
- Kunde has been a warning sign for my teachers.

153
00:14:02.680 --> 00:14:06.000
They were never clear with -

154
00:14:06.160 --> 00:14:12.440
- That I do not deserve this, that no one should have to be treated that way.

155
00:14:12.600 --> 00:14:19.200
No one really saw me, because I was so kind.

156
00:14:19.360 --> 00:14:23.480
I was good at school and cared for me -

157
00:14:23.640 --> 00:14:28.840
- But I felt very bad inside.
 But it probably didn't appear that much.

158
00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:33.880
My problem ... I thought it was due to my relationship with God.

159
00:14:34.040 --> 00:14:39.240
That it was wrong with me, that I didn't ...

160
00:14:41.320 --> 00:14:44.320
... succeeded in my relationship with God.

161
00:14:44.480 --> 00:14:50.960
I thought because my parents believed and was in that context.

162
00:14:51.120 --> 00:14:57.360
There was no alternative.
 That was what was offered.

163
00:14:58.840 --> 00:15:03.320
<b> <c.Cyan> Well, it's a parent's right </b> <b> <c.Cyan> to raise his child - </b>

164
00:15:03.480 --> 00:15:06.920
<b> <c.Cyan> - In accordance with the faith </b> <b> <c.Cyan> You yourself have. </b>

165
00:15:07.080 --> 00:15:13.280
<b> <c.Cyan> and of course the parent wants </b> <b> <c.Cyan> who thinks there is a true way - </b>

166
00:15:13.440 --> 00:15:16.760
<b> <c.Cyan> —Get it to their children. </b>

167
00:15:16.920 --> 00:15:20.080
<b> <c.Cyan> But no parent may forget - </b>

168
00:15:20.240 --> 00:15:26.080
<b> <c.Cyan> - that the child also </b> <b> <c.Cyan> has its own right to choose. </b>

169
00:15:26.240 --> 00:15:33.640
Just because you are born into a family and have legal guardians -

170
00:15:33.800 --> 00:15:37.200
- So you are not born into their religion.

171
00:15:37.360 --> 00:15:42.360
You have the right to choose your own religion or not to believe in anything.

172
00:15:42.520 --> 00:15:45.680
The older the child becomes -

173
00:15:45.840 --> 00:15:51.040
- Desto more should listen to the child and show a breadth.

174
00:15:51.200 --> 00:15:55.600
"This is our religion, so here we have chosen to raise you" -

175
00:15:55.760 --> 00:16:00.160
- "But it's not something you need to do."

176
00:16:00.320 --> 00:16:06.400
You don't have to be 18 years old to say: "I don't believe this".

177
00:16:06.560 --> 00:16:14.000
It is your right as a child to have your own religion or not faith at all.

178
00:16:14.160 --> 00:16:20.320
The Convention on the Rights of the Child ... Södermalm Church had its own Convention on the Rights of the Child.

179
00:16:20.480 --> 00:16:22.360
But...

180
00:16:23.680 --> 00:16:30.080
... thinking freely does not exist, since no one needs it.

181
00:16:30.240 --> 00:16:36.840
You get a finished manual for how to live, it's just driving.

182
00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:43.160
This you should be, so here you should behave, so here you should think and feel.

183
00:16:46.960 --> 00:16:53.800
It is a bit ridiculous to talk about religious freedom, because there is not.

184
00:16:56.800 --> 00:16:58.360
No.

185
00:17:00.400 --> 00:17:05.960
When I was told that there were some thoughts that you couldn't even think -

186
00:17:06.120 --> 00:17:09.840
- Because it could lead one to not believe in God.

187
00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:14.760
And if you think that what is at stake is a lifetime of torture -

188
00:17:14.920 --> 00:17:18.360
- Don't want to think these sinful thoughts.

189
00:17:18.520 --> 00:17:22.840
I felt that e.g.
 certain issues of human rights -

190
00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:29.400
–As LGBTQ rights and feminism, which were not included in the religion-

191
00:17:29.560 --> 00:17:33.200
- were justified.

192
00:17:33.360 --> 00:17:40.040
But then God says "I know best", according to what I had learned.

193
00:17:40.200 --> 00:17:46.320
"I know best, and if you don't agree with me, you end up in hell."

194
00:17:46.480 --> 00:17:52.600
Then it is very difficult to follow one's own morality, its humanity -

195
00:17:52.760 --> 00:17:55.960
- You follow what religion says.

196
00:17:56.120 --> 00:17:59.960
Once, when it was something I wanted to do -

197
00:18:00.120 --> 00:18:04.720
–As my parents: "You can't, you're a Christian."

198
00:18:04.880 --> 00:18:08.960
Then I said, "Then I don't want to be a Christian."

199
00:18:09.120 --> 00:18:14.200
The huge horror that came over me the same second as I said it ...

200
00:18:14.360 --> 00:18:18.880
And it was not something my parents felt was good.

201
00:18:19.040 --> 00:18:25.120
As soon as I was crying on the sofa.
 What may I have been?
 Eight nine.

202
00:18:25.280 --> 00:18:28.760
And then I had to be saved again -

203
00:18:28.920 --> 00:18:34.160
–Give my life to Jesus and God -

204
00:18:34.320 --> 00:18:38.080
- And once again fit into the mold.

205
00:18:41.400 --> 00:18:47.040
- Do you ever go your old life?
 -Every day.

206
00:18:47.200 --> 00:18:51.760
I miss my family and my old friends.
 It was a whole life.

207
00:18:51.920 --> 00:18:56.040
It wasn't just something that you could throw away.

208
00:18:56.200 --> 00:19:01.720
Obviously I miss them and think about them.

209
00:19:01.880 --> 00:19:07.640
<b> <c.Cyan> Jonnah chose love </b> <b> <c.Cyan> and life outside Jehovah's Witnesses - </b>

210
00:19:07.800 --> 00:19:11.720
<b> <c.Cyan> —trot that it cost her </b> <b> <c.Cyan> contact with the parents. </b>

211
00:19:11.880 --> 00:19:17.040
<b> <c.Cyan> and now she will finally </b> <b> <c.Cyan> get her nursing degree. </b>

212
00:19:17.200 --> 00:19:20.520
<b> <c.Cyan> She doesn't know if the parents are coming - </b>

213
00:19:20.680 --> 00:19:26.520
<b> <c.Cyan> - but the new friends from </b> <b> <c.Cyan> the training should celebrate with her. </b>

214
00:19:29.120 --> 00:19:33.160
Three years of study, and now you graduate.

215
00:19:33.320 --> 00:19:37.360
As soon as I start working.

216
00:19:37.520 --> 00:19:45.080
It is a point when your adult life begins, the life you have chosen yourself.

217
00:19:45.240 --> 00:19:52.960
Just.
 Now it becomes the reality that I have wanted for so long.

218
00:19:53.120 --> 00:19:56.720
So it will be good.
 /Doorbell/

219
00:19:59.160 --> 00:20:04.400
-Hello!
 Welcome.
 -Thanks.

220
00:20:04.560 --> 00:20:09.240
-Hello!
 How are you?
 - Yes.

221
00:20:09.400 --> 00:20:13.560
- God, how nice you are.
 - You are with that.

222
00:20:13.720 --> 00:20:17.720
Today we graduate!
 Haja.

223
00:20:17.880 --> 00:20:21.360
- I am getting hungry now.
 -Me too.

224
00:20:21.520 --> 00:20:24.520
Should we run some wine?

225
00:20:24.680 --> 00:20:29.200
I was so tagged this morning when I woke up: "That's the exam!"

226
00:20:29.360 --> 00:20:35.080
Hello, should we start with cuts?
 Should we start fixing a little?

227
00:20:35.240 --> 00:20:39.560
<c.YELLOW> Anna: What do you know about Jonnah's background?

228
00:20:39.720 --> 00:20:45.440
- We have been told a little.
 - You know about my family and ...

229
00:20:45.600 --> 00:20:51.520
Before I got to know you, I didn't know much about Jehovah at all.

230
00:20:51.680 --> 00:20:56.760
But now you have control over what it means -

231
00:20:56.920 --> 00:20:59.640
- And how you grew up.

232
00:20:59.800 --> 00:21:03.080
And how you were.

233
00:21:03.240 --> 00:21:08.320
It's been a lot for you.
 It's strong, the trip you've made.

234
00:21:08.480 --> 00:21:12.840
And so you stand here today, nurse.
 It is big.

235
00:21:13.000 --> 00:21:20.280
Mm.
 Thanks.
 But that is thanks to your support as well.

236
00:21:21.160 --> 00:21:24.960
- The one here looks absolutely magical.
 - They look very good.

237
00:21:25.120 --> 00:21:30.160
- Blue cheese with blueberries for ... - it's so good.

238
00:21:30.320 --> 00:21:35.520
- bowl for us.
 We are awesome.
 - Thanks for you.

239
00:21:36.520 --> 00:21:39.440
Comb over it.

240
00:21:39.600 --> 00:21:43.440
I like nightgown!
 /All laughs/

241
00:21:51.600 --> 00:21:56.160
<b> <c.Cyan> All children who grow up </b> <b> <c.Cyan> In religious homes, don't get bad. </b>

00:23:16.480 --> 00:23:22.000
Listen to the children, listen to the signals.

258
00:23:22.160 --> 00:23:30.520
Listen to your gut feeling and be hard, be problematic.

259
00:23:30.680 --> 00:23:35.840
It doesn't matter if anyone considers ...

260
00:23:36.000 --> 00:23:40.520
... that you exaggerate or are xenophobic.

261
00:23:40.680 --> 00:23:45.040
If you have a bad stomach feeling, it is probably true.

262
00:23:45.200 --> 00:23:49.360
Talk to the child.

263
00:23:49.520 --> 00:23:54.440
Don't be afraid to talk and ask the hard questions -

264
00:23:54.600 --> 00:24:00.840
- For that, save a life from misery.

Yes.

276
00:24:53.440 --> 00:24:59.320
Still, I think it is important to stand up for how it becomes for us.

277
00:24:59.480 --> 00:25:04.280
We who were ruled so hard to become something that we were not.

278
00:25:04.440 --> 00:25:09.120
What will be for us for us?
 And why do you allow it?

279
00:25:09.280 --> 00:25:12.200
Why are these methods allowed?

280
00:25:12.360 --> 00:25:15.800
This ... what's something?

281
00:25:15.960 --> 00:25:21.240
Why do you do this to young people?

282

284
00:25:32.400 --> 00:25:38.200
When I stopped believing ... the first morning when I woke up -

285
00:25:38.360 --> 00:25:42.960
- It was a liberation.
 I felt saved the other way.

286
00:25:43.120 --> 00:25:49.440
I am free!
 I don't have to pray, read the Bible, pray in tongues, go to meetings.

287
00:25:49.600 --> 00:25:54.720
There are no expectations of me.
 There is no one...

288
00:25:54.880 --> 00:26:00.680
... outstairs for me.
 It was like being able to breathe for the first time.

289
00:26:00.840 --> 00:26:06.800
It was such a tremendously strong experience of being free.

290
00:26:15.400 --> 00:26:20.480
- How does it feel now?
 - Yes, it was fun everything.

291
00:26:20.640 --> 00:26:24.000
-Completely exhausted?
 -Yes.
 You are tired now.

292
00:26:24.160 --> 00:26:27.800
But it has been a lot of fun all then.

293
00:26:27.960 --> 00:26:31.800
- But your parents didn't come.
 -No.

294
00:26:31.960 --> 00:26:37.080
If your dad would see this, see you now ...

295
00:26:37.240 --> 00:26:41.960
What would you say?
 What do you want him to hear?

296
00:26:42.120 --> 00:26:44.240
Yes...

297
00:26:44.400 --> 00:26:48.400
That I love him very much.

298
00:26:51.880 --> 00:26:56.160
- Then we hope he watches TV.
 -Yes.

299
00:27:02.640 --> 00:27:07.640
That I love him, and liked to have had him here.

300
00:27:07.800 --> 00:27:13.240
And mom, my brother and the whole family.
 It would have been great fun.

301
00:27:16.080 --> 00:27:18.600
That I miss him.

302
00:27:18.760 --> 00:27:25.200
There is not much to say, you just miss and love.

303
00:27:25.360 --> 00:27:30.560
And the very good want to have contact.
 I feel:

304
00:27:30.720 --> 00:27:37.600
"Here I am, I live my life, I'm doing well. I'm not dead."

305
00:27:37.760 --> 00:27:41.280
Yes.
 But it...
