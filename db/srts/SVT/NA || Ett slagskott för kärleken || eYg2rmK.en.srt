1
00:00:55.280 --> 00:01:03.040
- How is it really to be a manager?
 - I am a little sore in the fist.

2
00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:09.200
- They don't sound?
 - I talk about squash.

3
00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:17.240
- IIdioti that managers should play squash!
 - be glad you are not a hairdresser.

4
00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:25.480
Aino Nilsson showed a photo of Grace and Rainier: "So I want to look".

5
00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:33.520
- Making her to Grace is difficult.
 - Yes, I made her Rainier.

6
00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:41.680
But oh, what have you done in the forehead?
 Hi, Lina.

7
00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:50.520
There is a home in Karlstad where patients can roam freely.

8
00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:57.720
-She is in love.
 A new guy who is cute.
 - And he beats her?

9
00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:03.960
- But Sara!
 He asked what she was called.
 - What did she answer?

10
00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:07.720
She vomited ... a little on one shoe.

11
00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:15.760
Then she went into a cupboard.
 I don't get a word out of her.
 Are you trying to?

12
00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:21.120
–Ah ... she has a father?
 -No.

13
00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:26.760
He has subscribed to the ice hall.
 Max will be the best in ice hockey ...

14
00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:30.440
In the beginning you have to take it easy.

15
00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:38.680
- Gustav met Rask at Konsum ... - did he - croofed on his star to son?

16
00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:46.400
He said that Max should learn to skate before joining the team.

17
00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:54.120
Gustav chased a fast with the shopping cart and threw back potatoes at him.

18
00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:58.720
The world is full of mature men.

19
00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:04.120
Why do I help you with the accounting?

20
00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:10.920
- I owe your bank so much.
 -Right.
 Thanks.

21
00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:17.680
- Do you fill in the VAT with pink ink?
 -It's a lip pen.

22
00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:25.120
Clinique Midnight Purple.
 Nice to blue control tasks ...

23
00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:45.120
They will probably come soon.
 Do you think Max got to play today?

24
00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:53.920
Am I ugly?
 Max says guys don't like girls with dental position.

25
00:03:54.080 --> 00:04:01.840
Your dental position is not visible!
 People thought I had a harmonica in my mouth.

26
00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:09.680
- You didn't get any guys either?
 - Some musicians heard ...

27
00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:16.880
- I was cared for.
 You will do that.
 - Of what?
 Flies?

28
00:04:17.040 --> 00:04:23.880
- What was all these guys called, then?
 - God, what was they called ...

29
00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:30.560
- It was dad and ... - you have just been with dad.

30
00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:39.080
We fell in love and that way it is.
 Isn't life fantastic?

31
00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:42.480
Really.

32
00:04:42.640 --> 00:04:48.920
C.Sangseiern is spring, Seiern is spring!
 C.Sangvi has won, Seiern is spring!

33
00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:56.520
I haven't been so much since I cut the lawn.

34
00:04:56.680 --> 00:05:04.280
When Tage Erlander was prime minister.
 - Max, did you have to join the ice?

35
00:05:04.440 --> 00:05:08.520
Don't chat about details!

36
00:05:08.680 --> 00:05:16.200
Nothing goes up to see you on the bench with winning instinct in your eyes!

37
00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:19.560
Rasmus says the sign means:

38
00:05:19.720 --> 00:05:25.240
"Fit max, so he doesn't infect on the ice."

39
00:05:25.400 --> 00:05:29.320
Don't worry about Rasmus!

40
00:05:29.480 --> 00:05:36.320
On Saturday you play center instead of Rasmus Rask!

41
00:05:36.480 --> 00:05:41.320
No one learns to skate in two days.

42
00:05:41.480 --> 00:05:45.320
Well, Börje Salming.

43
00:05:45.480 --> 00:05:53.080
- You brother has made progress today.
 - Did he think be in the dressing room?

44
00:05:53.240 --> 00:05:59.760
- Have you been injured?
 - She has entered a cupboard.

45
00:05:59.920 --> 00:06:07.480
- What was it wrong with Techno?
 - She had met a guy.

46
00:06:08.520 --> 00:06:13.920
Now things happen!
 What's his name?

47
00:06:14.080 --> 00:06:18.200
- Peter.
 --Forsberg?

48
00:06:18.360 --> 00:06:20.760
Runesson!

49
00:06:20.920 --> 00:06:27.480
Gumman, it's time for conversation between father and daughter ...

50
00:06:27.640 --> 00:06:31.480
You're twelve years ...

51
00:06:31.640 --> 00:06:35.960
-Fourteen!
 - Same the same.

52
00:06:36.120 --> 00:06:43.760
When I was your age, I was terribly fond of a girl.

53
00:06:43.920 --> 00:06:51.560
I didn't dare talk to her.
 But she had been just as fond of me.

54
00:06:51.720 --> 00:06:56.520
- Was she blind?
 -No.

55
00:06:58.280 --> 00:07:06.560
Because I didn't dare talk to her, I never got to meet her.

56
00:07:06.720 --> 00:07:11.800
That's one thing you have to find out:

57
00:07:11.960 --> 00:07:17.640
What he thinks about Tre Kronor's new team lineup.

58
00:07:17.800 --> 00:07:25.520
- Her god, do people have no humor?
 - Strange, you who are so fun!

59
00:07:26.880 --> 00:07:33.440
- Thanks, the old man.
 How does it feel now?
 - I will never place in the team.

60
00:07:33.600 --> 00:07:41.360
Trust me, I have said.
 Rask should see what a Svensson goes for!

61
00:07:41.520 --> 00:07:45.040
Exercise, so I take care of the rest.

62
00:07:45.200 --> 00:07:50.520
Okay, but I want a snowboard.

63
00:07:50.680 --> 00:07:56.040
It's done.
 The most important thing is not to play ...

64
00:07:56.200 --> 00:08:03.800
--... without crushing Kjell-Åke Rask.
 - It's time for a little tactic talk.

65
00:08:03.960 --> 00:08:10.800
This is your team.
 That's the team you are in. Max!

66
00:08:10.960 --> 00:08:18.200
You get in the middle zone, fits back to Bengt-Åke Rydin ...

67
00:08:22.760 --> 00:08:31.520
... dribbles past Näslund to Max Svensson ... Yes!
 Here you get the puck.

68
00:08:31.680 --> 00:08:35.360
No, this little black!

69
00:08:35.520 --> 00:08:42.560
Here comes Max Svensson again, he dribbles past Makarov, he is free.

70
00:08:42.720 --> 00:08:48.600
- He is approaching the goal and ... - no!

71
00:08:48.760 --> 00:08:55.160
Sara, for hell!
 You are in the middle of the goal yard!

72
00:08:57.400 --> 00:09:04.360
Your father tried to tackle me over the fence.
 "Sarge" ...

73
00:09:04.520 --> 00:09:12.000
- Is it something, skating on gravel?
 -Endurance!

74
00:09:12.160 --> 00:09:17.360
Stop dipping now.
 What does he look like?

75
00:09:17.520 --> 00:09:23.120
I do not know.
 It blackens to the eyes.

76
00:09:23.280 --> 00:09:29.440
- What do you feel when you meet him?
 - That I want to vomit.

77
00:09:29.600 --> 00:09:35.560
You could have better conditions ... Lina, don't get so nervous.

78
00:09:35.720 --> 00:09:41.320
I envy you.
 You have life ahead of you, unlimited with dreams.

79
00:09:41.480 --> 00:09:45.920
–And dental position.
 -It belongs to the.

80
00:09:46.080 --> 00:09:53.200
- You have fat hair, pimples, foot fungus.
 - Thanks, that's enough.

81
00:09:53.360 --> 00:09:58.800
I'll show one thing that few have seen ...

82
00:09:58.960 --> 00:10:04.240
Guess how old I am.
 Fifteen years.

83
00:10:04.400 --> 00:10:11.040
- You don't look wise!
 - You look like that at your age.

84
00:10:11.200 --> 00:10:18.280
–What do you have in the cheek?
 - A perch traits.
 I was a punk.

85
00:10:18.440 --> 00:10:25.720
We fought against the establishment, the government, the king and the whole court.

86
00:10:25.880 --> 00:10:30.600
But it was then and today is today.

87
00:10:30.760 --> 00:10:38.200
- So here you catch the one you are in love with.

88
00:10:38.360 --> 00:10:44.080
- You call.
 -Never!
 What if he answers!

89
00:10:44.240 --> 00:10:49.960
Then you can talk to him.
 Call now.

90
00:10:50.120 --> 00:10:57.640
And take this in case that ... you know.
 Good luck!

91
00:11:13.760 --> 00:11:20.840
Hello!
 This is Lina Svensson.
 In 7A.
 With long hair.

92
00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:27.960
Just that, I am ... that vomits.
 Did you get the shoes clean?
 Good.

93
00:11:28.120 --> 00:11:36.480
Huh?
 Party?
 Tonight?
 Gladly.
 Where?
 I'll just pick up the pen.

94
00:11:38.080 --> 00:11:44.280
How should you be able to score if you close your eyes?

95
00:11:44.440 --> 00:11:50.720
- I get gravel in my eyes!
 - Fill on the water bottle.

96
00:11:50.880 --> 00:11:55.320
And no scratches in the parquet!

97
00:12:00.680 --> 00:12:05.320
-Carelessness!
 -Do you have a pen?

98
00:12:05.480 --> 00:12:13.320
I took home 60 pens from work.
 They are among other things I took home.

99
00:12:13.480 --> 00:12:18.080
Have you put on the handset?!

100
00:12:18.240 --> 00:12:23.160
-Hear!
 - Someone talks at the other end.

101
00:12:23.320 --> 00:12:31.200
If Peter goes to this party without me, I murder you!
 Idiot!

102
00:12:31.360 --> 00:12:36.200
-I'm finished.
 - Then we set up the cones.

103
00:12:36.360 --> 00:12:42.840
Makarov will be round.
 Kjell-Åke and Rasmus Rask you tackle!

104
00:12:46.920 --> 00:12:55.280
... to Bengt-Åke Rydin.
 Max Svensson threads by.
 Great!

105
00:12:55.440 --> 00:12:59.320
Around the box there ...

106
00:13:00.480 --> 00:13:06.440
-How does it feel?
 Are you nervous?
 - No, I'm used to you.

107
00:13:11.680 --> 00:13:19.120
Tomorrow, Max Svensson will debut as a center in Ekberga IF.

108
00:13:19.280 --> 00:13:25.920
I also don't like Kjell - Åke but you exaggerate.

109
00:13:26.080 --> 00:13:32.080
He's evil!
 It was he who tore the mini golf course.

110
00:13:32.240 --> 00:13:37.320
- The city needed a parking garage.
 - Man does not tear a cultural heritage!

111
00:13:37.480 --> 00:13:44.360
Bane eight with the ceramic site, track twelve with the moat ...

112
00:13:44.520 --> 00:13:47.960
Someone has to show where the boundaries go.

113
00:13:48.120 --> 00:13:51.840
And "someone" is our ten -year -old son Max?

114
00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:59.080
Do not worry.
 He is starting to really like hockey.

115
00:13:59.240 --> 00:14:03.840
-Look!
 -What is it?

116
00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:11.000
Börje Salming's parents live luxury in Florida.

117
00:14:11.160 --> 00:14:18.840
"Salming's parents spend half the year in Börje's summer house."

118
00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:26.840
Look, if you are in the swimming pool you can almost reach the orange tree.

119
00:14:28.720 --> 00:14:35.640
- Max will never be a new Börje Salming.
 - Never say!

120
00:14:35.800 --> 00:14:44.480
- Think if we had square miles with grass!
 - Who would take care of that grass?

121
00:14:44.640 --> 00:14:49.640
You can't even buy gasoline for the mower.

122
00:14:49.800 --> 00:14:54.240
That grass is shot by pedro ...

123
00:14:54.400 --> 00:15:00.480
... the Mexican in Sombrero standing and rakes.

124
00:15:00.640 --> 00:15:06.840
- Look, Pedro comes with drinks ... - put away that newspaper.

125
00:15:08.760 --> 00:15:13.880
Lina looked for four hours for the party.

126
00:15:14.040 --> 00:15:21.120
- I have asked for forgiveness.
 - I found her in Vålberg.

127
00:15:21.280 --> 00:15:27.680
She stared into a Bratvurst and mumbled about "the darkness to take everyone".

128
00:15:30.720 --> 00:15:37.240
- I should make up her.
 - Can she sit mainly on the match?

129
00:15:37.400 --> 00:15:43.720
Important!
 Buy new skates for Max.
 Hans does not fit.

130
00:15:43.880 --> 00:15:51.080
- He got new skates a week!
 - They don't fit mentally.

131
00:15:51.240 --> 00:15:58.880
He is not mentally safe with them.
 Then you are chanceless on the ice.

132
00:15:59.040 --> 00:16:04.280
- Everything must be true!
 -You are sick.

133
00:16:04.440 --> 00:16:09.280
No, I only have workouts in the ass.

134
00:16:12.440 --> 00:16:16.600
Lena?

135
00:16:16.760 --> 00:16:24.400
Cut me!
 Do what the hell you just want me to sit here in peace and quiet!

136
00:16:24.560 --> 00:16:31.680
Gustav just learned that Max is not taken out.

137
00:16:31.840 --> 00:16:40.560
He carried Max in the car and screamed "So easily you do not dump a Svensson!"

138
00:16:40.720 --> 00:16:48.560
My husband thinks he is Honken and my daughter glare into a Bratwurst.

139
00:16:48.720 --> 00:16:55.560
-What have I done wrong?
 - You use the wrong conditioner.

140
00:16:55.720 --> 00:17:02.640
-What should I do?
 - Don't you read about that housewife?

141
00:17:02.800 --> 00:17:09.720
- Who shot his family?
 - She who moved out into the forest.

142
00:17:09.880 --> 00:17:16.720
It's been a long time since I saw such a happy person.

143
00:17:16.880 --> 00:17:24.800
- It said she needs help.
 - I thought it looked so cozy.

144
00:17:24.960 --> 00:17:32.080
Kjell-Åke Rask was here yesterday and his son.
 It was as usual ...

145
00:17:32.240 --> 00:17:38.760
Rasmus always refuses to take off the helmet and Kjell-Åke refuses to pay.

146
00:17:38.920 --> 00:17:44.840
How could he demolish the mini golf course?
 Didn't Gustav have track record there?

147
00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:52.560
Yes.
 He would baptize Max on track nine.

148
00:17:52.720 --> 00:17:58.840
Romantic ... It's nice that Gustav tries to give him a homework.

149
00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:05.000
He can do it in a healthy way - kill him.

150
00:18:05.160 --> 00:18:13.920
- Sara, Peter called!
 - Don't you lowered a hat?

151
00:18:14.760 --> 00:18:20.920
He wants us to go to the cinema.
 You have to make me nice!

152
00:18:21.080 --> 00:18:25.920
- Hallå ... - What do you think he likes?

153
00:18:26.080 --> 00:18:30.920
- Everything except perch traits.
 - Labor traits?

154
00:18:34.440 --> 00:18:39.080
- Can I have this?
 -You are very cute.

155
00:18:39.240 --> 00:18:43.520
Is everything perfect?

156
00:18:43.680 --> 00:18:49.840
-Almost.
 The female is on the entrance.
 - I take care of them.

157
00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:56.840
C.Sangseiern is spring, Seiern is spring!
 C.Sangnita judge, split his thighs!

158
00:18:57.000 --> 00:19:03.640
Pack the bags.
 Pedro is waiting with the drinks in Florida.

159
00:19:03.800 --> 00:19:12.520
- Max spent the match on the rink.
 - Did you spike him in the coffin?

160
00:19:12.680 --> 00:19:16.160
Be proud of our son.

161
00:19:16.320 --> 00:19:21.640
From the exchange bench to the center forward in three days!

162
00:19:21.800 --> 00:19:28.520
- He wouldn't play?
 -I had to.
 Rasmus didn't come.

163
00:19:28.680 --> 00:19:34.600
Someone had locked him in the dressing room.

164
00:19:36.520 --> 00:19:40.720
Would I lock in a ten -year -old guy?

165
00:19:40.880 --> 00:19:46.520
- Something goes the limit.
 –In eleven?

166
00:19:46.680 --> 00:19:52.520
Our son made the decisive victory goal!

167
00:19:52.680 --> 00:20:01.480
Max Svensson showed who is Ekberga's real hockey star!

168
00:20:01.640 --> 00:20:06.960
I got the puck in my neck when I knotted the skates.

169
00:20:07.120 --> 00:20:15.080
You steered it in!
 What a presence!
 You can go as far as possible.

170
00:20:15.240 --> 00:20:22.400
- This I think we are celebrating!
 -I think so too.
 Be so good, read.

171
00:20:27.360 --> 00:20:32.440
-What is this?
 - Read!

172
00:20:32.600 --> 00:20:41.520
"I hereby swear that Max should never have to do with hockey again."

173
00:20:41.680 --> 00:20:47.800
"I guarantee he gets a snowboard before the week is over."

174
00:20:47.960 --> 00:20:54.280
-Sign.
 -Never.
 You start getting it in.

175
00:20:54.440 --> 00:21:01.240
All great sportsmen end when they are on top.

176
00:21:01.400 --> 00:21:08.040
-Sign!
 - I squeezed me when I locked the door.

177
00:21:08.200 --> 00:21:15.640
- To the dressing room ... another!
 - You locked that boy!

178
00:21:15.800 --> 00:21:20.160
I think Rasmus learned something.

179
00:21:20.320 --> 00:21:26.120
- That is boring in changing rooms?
 - That you don't tease Max unpunished!

180
00:21:26.280 --> 00:21:32.480
He had comic books and during the break he got juice through straws in the lock.

181
00:21:32.640 --> 00:21:36.880
-Sign!
 -Impossible.

182
00:21:37.040 --> 00:21:44.800
What would Borg have been if his parents had not been behind him?

183
00:21:44.960 --> 00:21:50.720
- Consultant maybe?
 - I never sign!

184
00:21:50.880 --> 00:21:56.240
–Okay ... matches.
 - Should he start smoking?

185
00:21:56.400 --> 00:22:02.080
- Serve goodbye to your autograph collection.
 - You don't!

186
00:22:02.240 --> 00:22:08.600
--Borg, Martin Dahlin, Makarov ... - I do!

187
00:22:10.560 --> 00:22:15.720
It is a pleasure to do business with you.

188
00:22:22.680 --> 00:22:27.480
- I will miss him.
 - He lives here.

189
00:22:27.640 --> 00:22:30.680
I mean Pedro, the gardener.

190
00:22:30.840 --> 00:22:37.240
Pedro is dead.
 Salming's father drove him over with the lawnmower.

191
00:22:37.400 --> 00:22:43.560
He left a message to you: "Cut the grass himself, and stop dreaming."

192
00:22:44.560 --> 00:22:52.720
- Hi, Honken, how did the match go?
 - Line, sorry.
 I've been stupid.

193
00:22:52.880 --> 00:23:00.400
So now I think we go to the cinema!
 We had so much fun last time.

194
00:23:00.560 --> 00:23:08.280
- Whatever shudder at the end!
 - When the thunderbump was chased by robbers?

195
00:23:08.440 --> 00:23:16.920
- Should we see if it is still going?
 - I will go to the cinema with Peter.

196
00:23:17.080 --> 00:23:22.400
- Then we get company!
 I invite.
 - Peter offers.

197
00:23:22.560 --> 00:23:24.640
Thank you!

198
00:23:27.080 --> 00:23:30.040
Me, just me.

199
00:23:30.200 --> 00:23:35.880
-Bye.
 -Have fun!
 Don't come home prematurely.

200
00:23:37.080 --> 00:23:43.160
- You can invite me to the cinema.
 - If I have to decide the movie!

201
00:23:43.320 --> 00:23:48.960
Nothing signed, please?
 Gustav ...

202
00:23:49.120 --> 00:23:56.960
We'll probably have to do it another time.
 Kjell-Åke's Merca stayed outside!

203
00:23:57.120 --> 00:24:01.440
Okay.
 We have to sort out one and the other.

204
00:24:01.600 --> 00:24:08.240
-Are you sure about that?
 - I've never been so sure!

205
00:24:10.280 --> 00:24:15.080
Okay we do this way ...

206
00:24:15.240 --> 00:24:21.440
We pick up Max and jump out through the bathroom window.

207
00:24:21.600 --> 00:24:29.640
He had the club in his hand.
 Kjell-Åke stood behind and held the dogs.

208
00:24:29.800 --> 00:24:34.720
Max, we're going out with the car a turn!

209
00:25:12.200 --> 00:25:14.840
