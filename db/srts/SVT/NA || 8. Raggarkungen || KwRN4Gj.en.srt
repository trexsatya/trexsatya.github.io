1
00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:20.520
Well, Leif Öhman ...

2
00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:25.920
What are you sitting here for?

3
00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:33.000
It got a little mess yesterday down at the pizzeria.

4
00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:36.880
Well, with whom then?

5
00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:41.640
Two guards flew on me, so I had to put them in place.

6
00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:47.160
Damn!
 What happened?

7
00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:54.120
I pulled a double stroke in the solar plexus on the first.

8
00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:57.200
Then I drew a judo throw ...

9
00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:00.240
Leif!
 What are you doing?

10
00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:03.480
God damn!
 Satan!

11
00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:08.720
How did you do?

12
00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:17.000
Damn, what a fight fighter!
 Become a ragger!
 We need someone like you.

13
00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:26.960
- I don't know, I have the farm ... - hell, with us you don't have to.

14
00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:31.920
The brother has a hard time managing herself as well.

15
00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:38.800
The brother?
 You mean he like you when you were in the hospital?

16
00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:45.080
- Yes, but the doctors told him ... —leif!
 Your brother betrayed you.

17
00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:48.600
With us you will never be betrayed.

18
00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:53.000
- I will take me a think.
 -Do it.

19
00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:11.560
- All your kings.
 -Go Fish.

20
00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:17.160
I do not believe that!
 You cheat after all.
 Shit!

21
00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:23.840
It is Leif who has taught me.
 Satan!
 Leif!
 What time is it?

22
00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:29.520
-A quarter past eleven.
 - I would have picked up him eleven.

23
00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:35.280
-I have to leave.
 Bye.
 -Drive carefully.

24
00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:04.040
Hello there.

25
00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:09.080
Where the hell are you, Billy?

26
00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:19.480
-Gosh!
 Has the brother left you again?
 - It may have happened.

27
00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:25.640
- He might be hanging out with his new girl.
 -I do not know...

28
00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:30.920
Jump in the car.
 We are running you.

29
00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:45.720
Many shit in the family when a girl comes into their lives.

30
00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:51.720
- Billy has done it a few times.
 - We've seen it.

31
00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:58.280
Shouldn't you keep up with us instead?
 Your brother has been a pig.

32
00:03:58.440 --> 00:04:04.280
- Damn cheaters.
 -Svikar-Billy.

33
00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:09.440
Switch-Billy, Svevikar-Billy.

34
00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:12.240
Switch-Billy, Svevikar-Billy.

35
00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:17.880
Sweet-billy, fir-billy, fir-billy, fir-billy!

36
00:04:18.040 --> 00:04:23.600
Sweet-billy, fir-billy, fir-billy, fir-billy!

37
00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:26.400
It is good.
 - Drive.

38
00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:40.720
Where the hell is Leif?
 He must have gone home already.
 Damn!

39
00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:55.120
Leif!

40
00:04:58.840 --> 00:05:01.360
Hi, Leif.

41
00:05:02.640 --> 00:05:08.760
- Yeah.
 Now it is suitable to come.
 - Forgotten, I forgot.

42
00:05:08.920 --> 00:05:13.600
You forgot!
 You were well with the damned Elin.

43
00:05:13.760 --> 00:05:19.240
- Yes, we played briefly ... –And you forgot your own brother.

44
00:05:19.400 --> 00:05:25.200
- When I froze outside the prison.
 - You just sat in the filling cell?

45
00:05:25.360 --> 00:05:30.920
I mucked from the kitchen!
 And not damn you were there.

46
00:05:31.080 --> 00:05:37.760
Do you know who picked me up from the kitchen when I got out of there?

47
00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:49.680
Skeva-Lena, Dunken and Jimmy with the knife.

48
00:05:49.840 --> 00:05:55.000
- They set up for me.
 - What do you do with your dad's old jacket?

49
00:05:55.160 --> 00:06:00.360
You have chosen your path in life, and fate has chosen my course.

50
00:06:00.520 --> 00:06:05.080
–What for course?
 - Crime, Billy.

51
00:06:05.240 --> 00:06:11.640
If you have once entered it, you do not go out.
 It's your fault!

52
00:06:13.720 --> 00:06:16.440
Is heard.

53
00:06:16.600 --> 00:06:19.920
-Where are you going?
 - Club house.

54
00:06:58.200 --> 00:07:01.960
- Leffe.
 - Well, the can.

55
00:07:02.120 --> 00:07:06.760
You came anyway.
 Come in for fuck.

56
00:07:12.320 --> 00:07:18.440
Hörni, now he's here.
 Stor-Leffe.
 - Sit down.

57
00:07:21.360 --> 00:07:28.000
- We have a new member.
 - The fight fighter.
 Welcome.

58
00:07:28.160 --> 00:07:34.640
- Should we put on the club emblem?
 - You can put it on the jacket here.

59
00:07:34.800 --> 00:07:41.440
Lol!
 On the jacket?
 No, it is going into the skin.

60
00:07:41.600 --> 00:07:45.880
- I don't know ... - for hell!

61
00:07:46.040 --> 00:07:52.280
- You don't bangs?
 All of us have one.
 - I've been in a shoulder since the Judoast.

62
00:07:52.440 --> 00:07:56.560
- Do you bake?
 - Are you a fucking stupid?

63
00:07:56.720 --> 00:08:02.600
- Are you a man or mouse?
 -MAN!
 Okay, turn on the tattoo then.

64
00:08:02.760 --> 00:08:08.320
-Let's go.
 -Good.
 Get the machine, skeva-Lena.

65
00:08:15.240 --> 00:08:18.880
Leif is so mad at me.

66
00:08:19.040 --> 00:08:24.760
If you are so worried, can you just call?

67
00:08:26.240 --> 00:08:30.360
Yes, I must do it.
 Damn!

68
00:08:36.680 --> 00:08:43.320
- What do you have for club emblems, then?
 - A burning falcon.

69
00:08:43.480 --> 00:08:46.960
The fattest tattoo you've seen.

70
00:08:47.120 --> 00:08:53.240
You don't want something goofy, like flowers or hearts and such crap.

71
00:08:53.400 --> 00:08:57.160
You don't have to worry about that.

72
00:09:03.680 --> 00:09:07.320
- Yes, Leif.
 - Hi, it was Billy.

73
00:09:07.480 --> 00:09:12.120
- What Billy?
 - You little brother.

74
00:09:12.280 --> 00:09:17.680
He who went on a date when I was in hospital -

75
00:09:17.840 --> 00:09:20.960
–And left me when I mucked?

76
00:09:21.120 --> 00:09:24.440
Yes, but ... shouldn't you come home?

77
00:09:24.600 --> 00:09:29.680
I am insisted in crime hugs and crime.

78
00:09:29.840 --> 00:09:35.920
I'm beyond rescue.
 And you have your girl, so shit in me.

79
00:09:36.080 --> 00:09:41.960
-What is that sound?
 - I tattoo a fat fucking falcon.

80
00:09:42.120 --> 00:09:47.960
It burns and has itself.
 I don't have time with you.

81
00:09:49.440 --> 00:09:54.720
Hello?
 - He hung up.
 He said he tattooed himself.

82
00:10:01.800 --> 00:10:06.600
-So!
 - Is it ready?
 Was it good looking?

83
00:10:06.760 --> 00:10:11.160
- It was cruel.
 - Do you have a mirror?

84
00:10:11.320 --> 00:10:17.120
No.
 Turn on this, so it can heal properly.

85
00:10:17.280 --> 00:10:21.080
Good, Leif!
 You passed the first test.

86
00:10:21.240 --> 00:10:27.440
Now we will find a name for you.
 What do you want to be called?
 The king?

87
00:10:27.600 --> 00:10:33.920
Yes.
 The king, or maybe the king of death?
 Well, the king will be good.

88
00:10:34.080 --> 00:10:37.520
The king.
 It will be fine.

89
00:10:37.680 --> 00:10:40.720
Let's see...

90
00:10:45.880 --> 00:10:51.640
Not everyone gets the "king" on the jacket.

91
00:10:51.800 --> 00:10:55.000
Now Dad would have seen me.

92
00:10:55.160 --> 00:11:01.000
- So there, then we were ready.
 - Is it the king?

93
00:11:01.160 --> 00:11:03.920
Yes, now it stands the king.

94
00:11:04.080 --> 00:11:09.600
You can't have that hairstyle.
 You have to look harder.

95
00:11:09.760 --> 00:11:14.240
- He would fit in shaved.
 -Shaver!

96
00:11:20.480 --> 00:11:24.920
Now we'll make you look really fucking hard.

97
00:11:28.560 --> 00:11:31.240
Should you shave everything?

98
00:11:31.400 --> 00:11:35.520
You will look really fucking criminal.

99
00:11:42.120 --> 00:11:46.280
So there!
 Now we showcase our new member.

100
00:11:51.640 --> 00:11:57.920
Leffe, or the king, now you buy four hull goals for us.

101
00:11:58.080 --> 00:12:01.960
Look at me.
 You are one of us now.

102
00:12:07.320 --> 00:12:12.840
A teddy bear sausage with extra mustard, it is conditioner for the soul.

103
00:12:29.320 --> 00:12:33.120
Four with extra everything, mustard and rub.

104
00:12:33.280 --> 00:12:39.520
- But Leif, what have you been up to?
 - Don't you recognize your own brother?

105
00:12:39.680 --> 00:12:44.240
- You look like ... --... a criminal, I know!

106
00:12:44.400 --> 00:12:50.000
I am beyond rescue, insum!
 Let me be, for hell!

107
00:12:50.160 --> 00:12:58.880
- Do you know what it says on your back?
 - King.
 King did not fit.

108
00:13:04.480 --> 00:13:09.160
Be with your little girl friend and let me be.

109
00:13:23.240 --> 00:13:25.960
Thanks for the burgers, the cock.

110
00:13:36.880 --> 00:13:42.080
-What happened?
 - We are doing some crime.

111
00:13:42.240 --> 00:13:44.800
I'll keep watch.

112
00:13:44.960 --> 00:13:51.480
Don't you realize that they drive with you?
 Have you seen what it says on the jacket?

113
00:13:55.400 --> 00:13:58.040
The cock ...

114
00:13:58.200 --> 00:14:01.720
Come, Leif.
 We go into the heat.

115
00:14:01.880 --> 00:14:05.040
- But they said ... - come.

116
00:14:13.600 --> 00:14:16.600
What have they done with their hair?

117
00:14:16.760 --> 00:14:19.280
Eh ... okay.

118
00:14:24.440 --> 00:14:29.720
My hair!
 Satan, they have tricked me.
 Cursed!

119
00:14:29.880 --> 00:14:35.440
Calm down, you have us.
 Ignore those fucking pigs.

120
00:14:35.600 --> 00:14:41.080
The tattoo, then?
 Is it a big burning falcon?

121
00:14:41.240 --> 00:14:46.200
- No ... - yes!
 A huge burning falcon.

122
00:14:46.360 --> 00:14:52.400
- Yes, just that.
 Shit.
 -Really.

123
00:14:53.240 --> 00:14:58.680
Now we are all together again.
 You are the best I know.

124
00:14:58.840 --> 00:15:02.920
Now we never have to be separated.

125
00:15:03.080 --> 00:15:09.080
- Corner, I have to tell you one thing.
 -What?

126
00:15:09.240 --> 00:15:15.240
I got a job in Stockholm.
 I need to move back there.

127
00:15:15.400 --> 00:15:21.760
No, Elin!
 Damn.
 Do you have to move?
 Can't stay here?

128
00:15:21.920 --> 00:15:28.480
I've done everything to try to get some kind of income here.
 It's not possible!

129
00:15:28.640 --> 00:15:35.520
- It has to be a little driven.
 - As you two?

130
00:15:35.680 --> 00:15:39.720
We have both healthcare allowance and a cash register.

131
00:15:39.880 --> 00:15:44.280
Although it means that you are unemployed.

132
00:15:44.440 --> 00:15:50.560
Income as income.
 It is important to get to know the right people here in the village.

133
00:15:50.720 --> 00:15:55.440
The right people?
 People who write the "cock" on their backs?

134
00:15:55.600 --> 00:16:00.000
- Why did they write so?
 - They wrote wrong well.

135
00:16:00.160 --> 00:16:06.720
Yes, they did well.
 Well, Billy and the cock, should we pull?

136
00:16:13.240 --> 00:16:18.440
- Do you get it away?
 - So there!

137
00:16:18.600 --> 00:16:23.720
- I will miss you, Elin.
 - I too, actually.

138
00:16:23.880 --> 00:16:29.280
- I will miss you too.
 - We get to visit Stockholm.

139
00:16:29.440 --> 00:16:34.800
- Trying at Spy Bar maybe?
 - I haven't seen that movie yet.

140
00:16:45.240 --> 00:16:48.400
