1
00:00:06.280 --> 00:00:09.600
Art - or weirdness.

2
00:00:12.280 --> 00:00:17.560
Sweden's art history is part of the huge story of our country.

3
00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:21.120
We will with some impacts show art-

4
00:00:21.280 --> 00:00:25.640
- As depicts changes and creation power.

5
00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:47.000
The thirty-year war.
 It went on when she was born ...

6
00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:50.880
... Little Kristina 1626.

7
00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:56.320
And when she became queen, 18 years later, it was still going on.

8
00:00:56.480 --> 00:01:01.920
She became a warrior queen even though she was burning for art and science.

9
00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:05.320
Here is a portrait of Kristina–

10
00:01:05.480 --> 00:01:08.760
- Painted the same year she was crowned.

11
00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:13.840
Coronation portraits usually be with a mantle with hermelin fur -

12
00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:17.640
- And a large crown, sprout and faith.

13
00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:20.760
But this is almost private.

14
00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:27.200
She stands on a balcony, leaning against a balustrade with a little questioning look -

15
00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:30.320
- Near as if we are bothering her.

16
00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:35.680
It's a bit special, because the portrait is about her role -

17
00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:44.960
- As queen, as a ruler.
 But it does in a discreet way.

18
00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:52.200
That portrait i.a.
 is known for in art history is -

19
00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:58.440
- That is an allegorical portrait, it tells more than what we just see.

20
00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:03.200
This is the elements - the four elements.

21
00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:07.560
The water is the fountain that sprays here at the back.

22
00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:11.920
The earth is the globe on which the queen puts her hand.

23
00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:16.720
And the air is the natural power that gets this veil -

24
00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:23.080
- As she agrees with her left hand - to lift and be filled as a sail.

25
00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:29.120
Then an element is missing: the fire.
 Where is the fire?
 It is Kristina herself.

26
00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:34.080
You can read it easily as a defense for the monarchy:

27
00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:37.640
That a unifying principle is needed ...

28
00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:43.520
... Someone who with wisdom and understanding as well as controls it all.

29
00:02:55.560 --> 00:03:01.080
The great power time.
 For some, the dreams still live today about the time -

30
00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:06.160
- Then Sweden was a respected and dreaded country in Europe.

31
00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:11.880
For Kristina, the time as a regent was no dream.
 She wanted something else.

32
00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:17.080
In December 1644, Queen Kristina turned 18 -

33
00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:22.640
- And became of legal age.
 The frozen capital of the new superpower -

34
00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:26.640
- Filled with foreign diplomats and scholars.

35
00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:32.800
Formed Catholics bid for a more beautiful world and a more beautiful life.

36
00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:37.200
She longed away from beer drinking generals -

37
00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:40.360
–And High -voiced theologians.

38
00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:48.080
I think this is how she wanted to be perceived.

39
00:03:48.240 --> 00:03:52.200
Her decision to abdicate has matured.

40
00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:56.480
She is produced more as a philosopher or writer -

41
00:03:56.640 --> 00:03:59.680
–Or as well as learning persons -

42
00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:04.680
- which can be discussed quickly with philosophers and poets.

43
00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:07.400
And she could.

44
00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:14.160
In 1654 she finally made her plans on abdication -

45
00:04:14.320 --> 00:04:18.040
- And his longing for further horizons.

46
00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:28.000
A well -known view of Rom travelers: Piazza del Popolo.

47
00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:34.000
This is where Queen Kristina rode in at her entry into Rome 1655–

48
00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:37.240
- On the way to kiss the pope's foot.

49
00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:44.920
The Pope received Kristina who became one of the city's cultural personalities.

50
00:04:45.880 --> 00:04:51.000
She had retained the queen title and she lived in a palace -

51
00:04:51.160 --> 00:04:54.680
- With art and service people.

52
00:04:54.840 --> 00:04:58.880
Here we have Kristina as a Romanian.

53
00:04:59.040 --> 00:05:05.000
Many have described Kristina during the autumn of her age in Rome-

54
00:05:05.160 --> 00:05:08.400
–As a short, small and bite -gum -

55
00:05:08.560 --> 00:05:13.280
- With double chin, a dirty wig.
 She did not care about her appearance.

56
00:05:13.440 --> 00:05:18.600
Here she is like a Roman Empress.
 There were many sculpted portraits -

57
00:05:18.760 --> 00:05:24.680
- Where you see this high hairstyle with curls.
 A little classic tunic.

58
00:05:24.840 --> 00:05:31.080
In her final phase, she identified more with the Roman environment -

59
00:05:31.240 --> 00:05:37.000
- There she still lives on as a kind of mythical figure.

60
00:05:38.840 --> 00:05:43.240
From her last notes we know she was tired.

61
00:05:43.400 --> 00:05:49.040
It tasted sand in her mouth.
 She was prepared for a major adventure:

62
00:05:49.200 --> 00:05:54.720
What started only when you enter through the copper gates of death.

63
00:05:58.840 --> 00:06:04.160
There are probably no regent portraits from the 17th century that are more important.

64
00:06:04.320 --> 00:06:06.840
They are so unusual -

65
00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:11.160
- With a reigning queen with that kind of personality.

66
00:06:11.320 --> 00:06:16.960
So I would say that these two are key works in Swedish art history.

67
00:06:20.480 --> 00:06:22.480
