1
00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:56.840
Don't forget to water upstairs.

2
00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:02.800
No ... now I have to go.
 I don't want to miss the plane.

3
00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:07.240
- Do you have everything?
 –Sí, Senora.

4
00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:15.120
- They don't speak Spanish in Greece.
 - The language of love is the same.

5
00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:19.680
Imagine getting to experience something!

6
00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:25.080
You can do this here too.
 Fresh potatoes are now available at Konsum.

7
00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:32.600
- What a wonderful you will get it!
 -But I miss Max's TV performance.

8
00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:38.120
It's not a Nobel Prize, Sara.

9
00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:45.000
We are in the 5th!
 - Everyone we know will look.

10
00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:52.360
- The grandmother wants to go down and cheer.
 - She just wants to be on TV.

11
00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:58.360
Good luck.
 Don't let them push you too hard.

12
00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:04.240
- Oh now, otherwise I'm not watering.
 --Ciao!

13
00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:10.000
I also want to go to Greece.

14
00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:17.360
You don't have to be nervous.
 It will go so well.

15
00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:25.160
Now say honestly what you think.
 The signature melody fades out.

16
00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:33.040
Then we run: Hello Max, you know most even though you are little

17
00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:39.080
Crack the others, they are plague push them down into the shit

18
00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:48.360
Those children who have not started crying then dare not answer a single question.

19
00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:53.440
Just!
 - Now you are on your way to the future, Max.

20
00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:59.280
My dreams were crushed, but no one should sniff you in your place in the sun.

21
00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:05.320
- What have you been sniffed at?
 - District 1.

22
00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:12.440
Downstairs all the way and mailboxes in south position.

23
00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:17.440
But my son will win in the 5th!

24
00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:25.120
- Created as Lindberg's boy.
 - I can't hear more about Svante.

25
00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:29.880
He had pondus already then.

26
00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:34.440
He is now 25 years old and adviser to the government.

27
00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:40.160
We in the 5th sell the bait from the wheat!

28
00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:44.160
Max, sit!

29
00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:51.600
Why should I read so much?
 You don't even get the price.

30
00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:58.080
For your and our government's future.

31
00:03:58.240 --> 00:04:03.720
-A book.
 - Oh, what a surprise ...

32
00:04:03.880 --> 00:04:12.680
There has been a lot of reading.
 But you should read this for your own sake.

33
00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:18.680
To widen your views.
 We in the 5th are just the beginning.

34
00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:26.360
- It is Jeopardy, the red thread ... - it may be a later question.

35
00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:33.240
- Set up now.
 - I come up and say good night.

36
00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:41.680
Gustav, we may not give him more books.

37
00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:50.720
This was a philosophy book that would give new perspectives on things.

38
00:04:52.160 --> 00:04:58.200
We may place too great demands on him.

39
00:04:58.360 --> 00:05:05.360
- When would Lina come from the disco?
 - You would pick her up now at 11 o'clock.

40
00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:12.360
- Can't you remind me?
 - If you have a daughter?

41
00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:19.360
Why should she run out?
 What is wrong with TV?

42
00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:26.080
Boys.
 She is 14 years old, this is now the start.

43
00:05:26.240 --> 00:05:32.840
- You remember what you did then?
 -Hell!

44
00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:38.720
My poor girl, Dad is coming!

45
00:05:46.880 --> 00:05:53.320
- Tell Mom what you have done!
 -Nothing!

46
00:05:53.480 --> 00:06:00.080
- See it!
 Still, the truth comes out.
 -I have danced.

47
00:06:00.240 --> 00:06:05.080
-Tell everything!
 - With a guy.

48
00:06:05.240 --> 00:06:12.800
- What would have happened if I arrived later?
 - She had danced another dance ...

49
00:06:12.960 --> 00:06:20.080
- I know what those dances are aiming for!
 –What then, Gustav?
 Tell!

50
00:06:20.240 --> 00:06:24.280
- Not now ... —Sex?

51
00:06:24.440 --> 00:06:30.320
Next time you will pick me up.
 Dad is too sensitive.

52
00:06:31.320 --> 00:06:37.880
- Who whistles in her like that?
 - The biology teacher, maybe.

53
00:06:38.040 --> 00:06:40.680
That goat!

54
00:06:41.720 --> 00:06:47.520
They actually have sex education.
 Empty.
 Max has it.

55
00:06:47.680 --> 00:06:51.320
What's with you?

56
00:06:51.480 --> 00:06:58.520
If not I look at our children, who should do it?

57
00:06:58.680 --> 00:07:04.520
-Alf Svensson?
 - We must not stifle the children.

58
00:07:04.680 --> 00:07:12.440
- Max has not played anything a week.
 - I don't think you understand.

59
00:07:12.600 --> 00:07:18.840
- Max should be on television.
 -It's exciting.

60
00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:25.000
But he must feel that it is a game!

61
00:07:25.160 --> 00:07:31.400
It all knows that when you compete you should have fun.

62
00:07:31.560 --> 00:07:39.120
You said that before the crash as well.
 My brother has a mark in the forehead yet.

63
00:07:39.280 --> 00:07:44.520
- He stood in the way.
 - He was in the kitchen!

64
00:07:44.680 --> 00:07:52.200
It was slippery in the grass - I was slanted.
 He won ... that fourth.

65
00:07:52.360 --> 00:07:57.800
Be careful with max.
 He is sensitive.

66
00:07:57.960 --> 00:08:05.120
- Max is good, a genius.
 - What goes into his head stops.

67
00:08:05.280 --> 00:08:11.040
Yes, you ... he has after me!

68
00:08:11.200 --> 00:08:15.560
But Max knows how to produce it.

69
00:08:15.720 --> 00:08:21.120
Soon everything will be in live broadcast.

70
00:08:21.280 --> 00:08:27.000
Sweden will be aware of what a wonderful son we have been nurtured.

71
00:08:27.160 --> 00:08:31.880
It will probably be good.
 Sleep now.

72
00:08:33.880 --> 00:08:37.400
c.Teletext.kjudskylk.kudvi in 5's signature melody

73
00:08:37.560 --> 00:08:40.320
Sleep now!

74
00:08:46.440 --> 00:08:51.160
- By the roof ... the dynamite man?

75
00:08:51.320 --> 00:08:57.760
No, the deck cord: Mr. X would go to the cinema.

76
00:08:57.920 --> 00:09:05.560
- But he had lost the key ... - I can't hear.
 I am worried.

77
00:09:05.720 --> 00:09:13.720
It is the fourth bank that is blown up this month.
 Imagine if he rob us.

78
00:09:13.880 --> 00:09:22.240
- He makes a mistake and gets stuck.
 -Good morning.
 Did you sleep well?

79
00:09:22.400 --> 00:09:28.080
-No.
 –The poor conscience gives poor sleep ...

80
00:09:28.240 --> 00:09:34.320
I don't have a bad conscience.
 I am ashamed.

81
00:09:34.480 --> 00:09:43.280
For you.
 You stood and flashed with the high beam for Jeanette and Erik.

82
00:09:43.440 --> 00:09:47.480
They had orgies!

83
00:09:47.640 --> 00:09:52.280
The girl stack is no more than 14 years.

84
00:09:52.440 --> 00:09:57.840
They are siblings.
 Erik gave her a hug.

85
00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:04.840
Shit the same!
 I care about my daughter!
 Where is Max?

86
00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:08.360
In bed.
 He has been reading all night.

87
00:10:08.520 --> 00:10:12.760
He does not give up until he knows everything.

88
00:10:12.920 --> 00:10:16.720
He has to sleep!

89
00:10:16.880 --> 00:10:19.800
Einstein slept three hours a day.

90
00:10:19.960 --> 00:10:23.880
And invented the atomic bomb ...

91
00:10:24.040 --> 00:10:27.880
Good morning, o wandering reference book!

92
00:10:28.040 --> 00:10:34.560
- What are you thinking about?
 - Death and our meaningless existence.

93
00:10:37.120 --> 00:10:45.240
- I should not join us in the 5th.
 - Humor gives distance to the tasks!

94
00:10:45.400 --> 00:10:51.560
I'm not going to join us in the 5th.

95
00:10:51.720 --> 00:10:56.360
Thanks.
 The book gave me so much.

96
00:11:03.840 --> 00:11:09.920
-No!
 - What is that book?

97
00:11:10.800 --> 00:11:14.640
Well, the one?
 A philosophy book.

98
00:11:14.800 --> 00:11:20.640
What is it called?
 Read on the cover, it usually stands there!

99
00:11:20.800 --> 00:11:24.960
Yes ... "Weight Fom Vivfaff".

100
00:11:25.120 --> 00:11:30.960
-What did you say?
 - "Mevöven as a driving force".
 Shall we go?

101
00:11:31.120 --> 00:11:35.440
"With death as a driving force" ...

102
00:11:35.600 --> 00:11:41.800
The bookstore said it had got many thinkers on the right track ...

103
00:11:41.960 --> 00:11:46.400
"Big thinkers?"
 Max is ten years!

104
00:11:46.560 --> 00:11:51.040
It was anything but tables and years.

105
00:11:51.200 --> 00:11:55.960
Now you really got him on the right track!

106
00:11:56.120 --> 00:12:00.080
You know how he becomes.

107
00:12:00.240 --> 00:12:07.880
When he read about toads, he demanded that we move down to the cart.

108
00:12:10.440 --> 00:12:15.160
I'll get him on his feet.

109
00:12:15.320 --> 00:12:21.240
Soon we will have our sunbeam back, trust me.

110
00:12:25.720 --> 00:12:30.240
O beautiful virgin, I'll save you.

111
00:12:30.400 --> 00:12:35.160
O Dyre Prince, watch out for the dragon!

112
00:12:35.320 --> 00:12:39.360
Servant everyone!

113
00:12:39.520 --> 00:12:46.720
Max, what the hell is it with you?
 Max, say something!

114
00:12:46.880 --> 00:12:51.080
Now you have been like this for two days.

115
00:12:51.240 --> 00:12:58.680
Think, spotlight, TV cameras ... all girls watching.

116
00:12:58.840 --> 00:13:05.320
Stop.
 I'm not going to go to Vi in the 5th.

117
00:13:05.480 --> 00:13:13.280
Those who write such books know nothing about life.
 Most are even
 kill!

118
00:13:14.880 --> 00:13:19.720
So it goes when you think too much!

119
00:13:19.880 --> 00:13:26.720
- Take with your brother on something fun.
 -What then?
 Funeral?

120
00:13:26.880 --> 00:13:33.520
Burials are a mockery against those who have not been resting.

121
00:13:33.680 --> 00:13:40.560
-What are you talking about?
 - About death, the only promise of life.

122
00:13:40.720 --> 00:13:44.640
Little old man, listen to me ...

123
00:13:44.800 --> 00:13:50.880
You probably have seventy years left to live.

124
00:13:51.040 --> 00:13:58.400
- That's why I'm sorry.
 - Why are you sorry for that?

125
00:13:58.560 --> 00:14:05.640
It's like not eating a cake because you are afraid it will end.

126
00:14:05.800 --> 00:14:11.360
- or not be part of Vi in the 5th.
 - He should not be there!

127
00:14:11.520 --> 00:14:15.800
- Have you called the class director?
 -It's occupied.

128
00:14:15.960 --> 00:14:19.800
Not for two days!
 I'll call.

129
00:14:19.960 --> 00:14:25.640
Max is in progress!
 Before, he could barely sit still!

130
00:14:25.800 --> 00:14:31.440
Such outbreaks take on the forces ... but soon he will be up and running again.

131
00:14:31.600 --> 00:14:34.480
I gotta go!

132
00:14:34.640 --> 00:14:41.480
-Where are you going?
 - Out and lift with foreign men.

133
00:14:42.640 --> 00:14:49.840
She is going to Jeanette.
 What does the teacher have for telephone numbers?

134
00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:54.920
It's the last chance!

135
00:14:55.080 --> 00:14:59.440
Come on!
 Say something to mom ...

136
00:14:59.600 --> 00:15:02.760
18 26 40.

137
00:15:08.560 --> 00:15:12.680
Hello, that's Max's mom.

138
00:15:12.840 --> 00:15:18.200
I don't think Max can join us in the 5th.

139
00:15:18.360 --> 00:15:22.280
He is scratchy.

140
00:15:22.440 --> 00:15:27.160
Well, you've been thinking about it before?

141
00:15:27.320 --> 00:15:34.000
Roger Olsson stands up?
 We keep our fingers crossed!

142
00:15:34.160 --> 00:15:38.560
It's not possible.
 May I have the handset!

143
00:15:38.720 --> 00:15:43.560
Yes.
 Bye.
 - Max, it solves!

144
00:15:43.720 --> 00:15:51.520
Roger Olsson cannot handle the press.
 After all, that poor man is a nerve wreck.

145
00:15:51.680 --> 00:15:59.480
It was he who fainted in the Lucia train when he was going to read the Christmas gospel.

146
00:16:00.840 --> 00:16:06.080
- I take a walk.
 - It's getting dark.

147
00:16:06.240 --> 00:16:09.240
Darkness is my home.

148
00:16:09.400 --> 00:16:15.600
Take a walk.
 I fix chocolate ... and sandwiches.

149
00:16:15.760 --> 00:16:20.720
-It's my fault.
 -Mine too.

150
00:16:20.880 --> 00:16:28.640
- Max has to catch himself.
 - I just wanted to pepper him!

151
00:16:28.800 --> 00:16:36.600
I saw Svante Lindberg step out of his BMW and hug his parents ...

152
00:16:36.760 --> 00:16:43.200
It is useful to think the opposite to their parents.

153
00:16:43.360 --> 00:16:48.840
As I did when I married you.

154
00:16:49.840 --> 00:16:54.840
Like when I told my mother that I refused to have baskets!

155
00:16:55.000 --> 00:17:01.840
- Then we had been married for three years.
 -But anyway...

156
00:17:06.600 --> 00:17:12.440
-Where is he?!
 - No classmates know.

157
00:17:12.600 --> 00:17:17.520
- I go and look.
 - There they come!

158
00:17:17.680 --> 00:17:23.520
- No ... - Here you are always equally welcome.

159
00:17:24.680 --> 00:17:32.680
Did you see Max?
 He has been away for three hours.
 He has disappeared!

160
00:17:32.840 --> 00:17:37.280
Maybe it was Max I saw.

161
00:17:37.440 --> 00:17:42.960
- I may have seen wrong.
 -Tell!

162
00:17:43.120 --> 00:17:49.560
There was someone on the bridge screaming about death and we in the 5th.

163
00:17:49.720 --> 00:17:57.080
- He is depressed!
 - He just makes himself.

164
00:17:57.240 --> 00:18:03.360
- You never worry about it.
 - Yes, but I just get shit for that!

165
00:18:03.520 --> 00:18:08.120
I go and look!

167
00:18:09.280 --> 00:18:13.400
Little old man!

168
00:18:13.560 --> 00:18:17.880
Come, they will take him!

169
00:18:18.040 --> 00:18:25.440
Svante Lindberg ... it is he who robbed all banks.

170
00:18:25.600 --> 00:18:32.000
- He is an adviser to the government!
 -Not any more...

171
00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:45.600
It is even for the last question.

173
00:18:51.160 --> 00:18:55.080
What is the president of Finland?

174
00:18:55.240 --> 00:19:02.360
- Sausages or cheese on the sandwiches?
 -Both.
 - Ahtisaari.

175
00:19:02.520 --> 00:19:07.400
- Has Roger fainted yet?
 -Soon.

176
00:19:07.560 --> 00:19:10.920
Roger, you have to hurry to answer.

177
00:19:11.080 --> 00:19:18.320
- It's just a matter of seconds.
 - Why do they force him to compete?

178
00:19:18.480 --> 00:19:22.960
- The match is over.
 - There he fainted!

179
00:19:23.120 --> 00:19:30.320
Roger ... what about you?
 Do you hear me?

180
00:19:32.280 --> 00:19:37.120
They didn't have a chance without you, Max.

181
00:19:37.280 --> 00:19:42.760
We send flowers or chocolate to Roger!

182
00:19:42.920 --> 00:19:48.520
Do not do it.
 He is allergic to both.

183
00:19:48.680 --> 00:19:52.200
-Hello!
 -Hello Sara!

184
00:19:52.360 --> 00:19:59.320
Here you travel away to experience something, and what happens?

185
00:19:59.480 --> 00:20:04.440
Abroad has no more to offer than the motherland!

186
00:20:04.600 --> 00:20:10.320
- Have you read?
 - A hundred times.

187
00:20:10.480 --> 00:20:17.400
"The perpetrator was traced to his parents' home."

188
00:20:17.560 --> 00:20:25.600
"After Max Svensson showed the way to the hiding place, the man could be arrested."

189
00:20:25.760 --> 00:20:32.880
- He tried to hide in our hut.
 - It's a picture here!

190
00:20:33.040 --> 00:20:37.440
Yes, you ... that's my son, it!

191
00:20:40.120 --> 00:20:44.520
HA!
 Svante Lindberg ...

192
00:20:44.680 --> 00:20:51.440
He said he was a explorer and had lived on the South Pole for three years.

193
00:20:51.600 --> 00:20:56.240
No, he was an adviser to the government.

194
00:20:56.400 --> 00:21:03.280
Gustav, did you see with his own eyes when he won in the 5th?

195
00:21:03.440 --> 00:21:06.520
No, but I trust the guy ...

196
00:21:06.680 --> 00:21:14.120
That lies!
 Stand here and lie to buy Christmas magazines!

197
00:21:14.280 --> 00:21:22.280
- I will return every one!
 - But Gustav, it's thirteen years ago!

198
00:21:22.440 --> 00:21:30.720
- How did you go for you in the 5th?
 - My son has more important things for himself!

199
00:21:30.880 --> 00:21:38.480
- How time is the first interview?
 -The clock seven comes local TV.

200
00:21:38.640 --> 00:21:46.560
- We must be rested in the pictures.
 - It's max to be photographed.

201
00:21:46.720 --> 00:21:54.680
Video -angle lens ... Even if you hide, you come along!

202
00:21:54.840 --> 00:22:00.840
My son and I wish you a good night.

203
00:22:02.600 --> 00:22:09.120
- Don't Max be in Vi in the 5th?
 - It can be so hysterical with that.

204
00:22:09.280 --> 00:22:14.280
We want to keep Max on earth.

205
00:22:14.440 --> 00:22:19.880
- Do you have no pictures from Greece?
 -Certainly...

206
00:22:22.240 --> 00:22:28.480
- This is the first day.
 - What a hairy they are!

207
00:22:28.640 --> 00:22:32.480
I was in their volleyball team!

208
00:22:32.640 --> 00:22:38.000
Adonis is so good looking.
 And the bearded ...

209
00:22:38.160 --> 00:22:44.720
- Do you have no pictures in the hotel?
 - Yes, here is the hotel.

210
00:22:47.080 --> 00:22:52.720
- was then?
 - That little whites behind Teodor.

211
00:22:52.880 --> 00:22:57.480
He was absolutely incredible.
 What a man!

212
00:22:57.640 --> 00:23:05.160
He showed me the island in two days.
 Do you know where we slept?
 On a lava beach.

213
00:23:05.320 --> 00:23:12.680
It was hard, and we wore no clothes.

214
00:23:12.840 --> 00:23:18.080
Lina, get up now.
 I'll be coming soon.
 - More!
