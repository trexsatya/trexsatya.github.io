1
00:00:01.480 --> 00:00:07.320
My name is Brita.
 This is Kalle.
 Welcome to our farm.

2
00:00:07.480 --> 00:00:12.240
Three years ago we decided that we and our children Björn, Essa and Glenn -

3
00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:15.960
- Leave the town for a new life.

4
00:00:16.120 --> 00:00:20.600
A life filled with animals, nature, cultivation and construction projects.

5
00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:24.000
Now it's finally time to celebrate Christmas.

6
00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:28.880
We were going to have a party for relatives and friends -

7
00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:36.120
- Where we fix food and do extra nicely.
 So this is our Christmas toy program.

8
00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:42.120
Welcome to our Christmas special!

9
00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:54.040
Hi, Brita!
 What are you doing?

10
00:00:54.200 --> 00:01:01.520
I'm looking for the Christmas things.
 Now we should not be out at the last second.

11
00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:04.640
- Not the day before Christmas Eve?
 -Just.

12
00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:09.880
Do you know what the best way to start in time is?
 We have a Christmas party!

13
00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:17.000
- I stand for the decoration.
 - I fix ham, some type of sausage ...

14
00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:20.280
And so something good to eat too.

15
00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:25.800
- I have zero ideas for decorations.
 - "Christmas is the feast of the eyes."

16
00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:31.240
It says in the old scriptures.
 <c.Sang> We wish you all an eye-liking-Christmas

17
00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:34.000
-Let's go.
 Christmas party!
 -Yes!

18
00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:39.640
What is in the old scriptures about Christmas?
 That it is eye -related?

19
00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:44.480
That you couldn't know that text!
 I believed more about you.

20
00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:54.280
Let's go!
 I start with the decoration and Kalle will probably start with mulled wine.

21
00:01:59.120 --> 00:02:04.800
This is mead.
 It's like wine made on honey.

22
00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:08.480
- you?!
 - I think it's still good.

23
00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:13.640
It is from season 1. Then you were as old as Björn is now.

24
00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:37.880
You may be wondering why I pour mead here.
 I'll make mulled wine.

25
00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:42.720
Now we will have more honey, so it gets sweeter.

26
00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:47.480
It must not boil, because then the alcohol boils away.

27
00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:53.400
We do not want to get rid of the alcohol like this when it is painting for Christmas!

28
00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:58.840
Christmas food has changed for me.

29
00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:03.960
It has become a lifestyle for me to fix food and produce food.

30
00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:08.880
Before, I thought, "What am I craving?"
 Now I think, "What do I have?"

31
00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:14.280
If you have not mead at home, you can take a muggy bag-in-box wine.

32
00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:19.960
It can be red, it can be white, it can be rosé.

33
00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:32.960
Do you know which spice likes the worst about twins?
 "No, equal!"

34
00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:36.160
Where do I get everything from?

35
00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:43.200
The sick thing is ... I'm starting to get drunk.
 I've tasted so many times.

36
00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:47.360
- Good Christmas, Kalle.
 - Good Christmas, Björn.

37
00:03:55.680 --> 00:04:01.880
This is a direct action to make sure Christmas gets nicer.

38
00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:06.920
Christmas can get pretty ugly, and I don't want ugly Christmas.

39
00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:10.280
I want sexy, good looking Christmas.

40
00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:16.640
One thing that I intend to do is table tablets.
 Exactly.

41
00:04:16.800 --> 00:04:22.480
My sewing machine stands here, but I probably won't use it.

42
00:04:22.640 --> 00:04:25.560
I will show a very fast way.

43
00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:31.320
This is a trick to get all corners the same.

44
00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:36.480
Type like this.
 Then I cut like this.

45
00:04:36.640 --> 00:04:41.400
Now it's super exciting.
 God, what a good looking!

46
00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:46.800
I who know what it will be like is very satisfied.

47
00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:52.560
Now I will attach a band - stuff at your local grocery store -

48
00:04:52.720 --> 00:04:58.600
- With a little textile glue, and follow this edge.
 "It is the whole."

49
00:04:59.840 --> 00:05:05.760
I love to celebrate Christmas on our farm.
 It feels like Christmas here is equal -

50
00:05:05.920 --> 00:05:12.160
- The one I want to create for my children, which I may have dreamed a little about myself.

51
00:05:12.320 --> 00:05:17.600
But there is a lot of time to decide the rules around Christmas.

52
00:05:17.760 --> 00:05:22.240
We do it our way.
 It sounds incredibly diligent.

53
00:05:22.400 --> 00:05:25.520
But is not Christmas also the feast -

54
00:05:25.680 --> 00:05:31.880
- When you get to be pretty much with sentimentality and nostalgia?

55
00:05:32.040 --> 00:05:35.160
Otherwise, Christmas has nothing.

56
00:05:35.320 --> 00:05:40.480
This is getting so fucking ugly.
 We can't show this to anyone.

57
00:05:41.440 --> 00:05:46.000
This idea of not sewing was pretty bad.

58
00:05:48.720 --> 00:05:54.000
Now we will try to get over mulled wine in these bottles.

59
00:05:55.080 --> 00:06:01.640
If I make bottles with capsule it can be sparkling.
 Surely there is?

60
00:06:01.800 --> 00:06:04.840
Mulled wine and champagne?

61
00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:08.000
Glubble!
 I'm going to make glubbles too.

62
00:06:09.360 --> 00:06:16.480
Now we are in unknown territory.
 It may be that there will be bubbles in.

63
00:06:17.400 --> 00:06:20.560
I have never done this before.

64
00:06:26.600 --> 00:06:29.600
Now the most fun is left.

65
00:06:30.720 --> 00:06:35.360
"Glave?"
 With question marks, because it can also just be mulled wine.

66
00:06:40.680 --> 00:06:43.640
It's cold in the winter.

67
00:06:56.560 --> 00:07:03.320
It's so fun to sew.
 Just to thread the machine - the adventure is in front of me.

68
00:07:03.480 --> 00:07:09.920
Now we set the machine to max zigzag, max density on the stitches.

69
00:07:15.400 --> 00:07:22.280
This was completely hell.
 It looks damn good.
 I can not...

70
00:07:22.440 --> 00:07:29.640
So, I will not settle for "totally okay" when it's Christmas.

71
00:07:32.240 --> 00:07:38.720
So now I'm trying to think out an alternative plan.

72
00:07:41.320 --> 00:07:47.840
In the boiler room I have thawed back fat from a wild boar jyl I shot.

73
00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:50.680
We will melt this.

74
00:07:54.520 --> 00:08:00.560
We will make sebum balls.
 You may think, "Do the birds eat meat?!"

75
00:08:00.720 --> 00:08:06.240
It does.
 If you have not seen a pigeon eating a hot dog, you have not lived.

76
00:08:06.400 --> 00:08:11.480
This is usually cut away when you cut animals, but it is good to have -

77
00:08:11.640 --> 00:08:17.880
- If you are going to make sausages, or sebum balls.
 Damn fat.

78
00:08:18.040 --> 00:08:23.000
I put this in the oven.
 100 degrees in ...

79
00:08:23.920 --> 00:08:27.040
...I do not know.
 We'll have to check out soon.

80
00:08:27.200 --> 00:08:30.240
It should melt, but not too fast.

81
00:08:35.720 --> 00:08:39.640
Now I will take this home.

82
00:08:39.800 --> 00:08:43.840
My brother linseed oil saves this.

83
00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:47.360
I will paint the edges.

84
00:08:47.520 --> 00:08:53.720
It gets tough and lacquered.
 Why wouldn't it work on textiles?

85
00:08:56.280 --> 00:09:00.800
There are some reasons.
 But it's worth a try.

86
00:09:03.040 --> 00:09:08.040
Check!
 Like a lovely Boeuf Bourguignon.

87
00:09:08.960 --> 00:09:14.720
Now we will make the sebaceous balls.
 Then we go out.

88
00:09:14.880 --> 00:09:19.640
God, it will be so neat.
 Will it hold a wash?

89
00:09:19.800 --> 00:09:23.440
I want to say yes.
 But I do not know.

90
00:09:24.120 --> 00:09:28.280
It is cozy to sit and play.

91
00:09:28.440 --> 00:09:33.760
It is easy to be stressed over everything that needs to be done.

92
00:09:33.920 --> 00:09:40.160
And then to force oneself to sit down and do something like this -

93
00:09:40.320 --> 00:09:45.080
- And maybe let the children participate to their own level ...

94
00:09:45.240 --> 00:09:48.760
So!
 It was good looking, right?

95
00:09:50.120 --> 00:09:55.080
Some little spruce and some nice napkins.

96
00:09:55.240 --> 00:09:58.280
Maybe a little...

97
00:09:58.960 --> 00:10:00.960
...food.

98
00:10:01.680 --> 00:10:05.360
Okay, it went to hell.

99
00:10:05.520 --> 00:10:11.280
Now I have to put in an extra gear.
 For me and Kalle are quite different.

100
00:10:11.440 --> 00:10:17.920
To me, what is seen is important, while he is more "function".

101
00:10:18.080 --> 00:10:24.920
Then we make the sebaceous balls.
 To make it a Christmas mood, I chose these.

102
00:10:25.080 --> 00:10:28.160
I start with some sunflower seeds.

103
00:10:29.560 --> 00:10:33.040
So.
 And then we take some wheat.

104
00:10:33.200 --> 00:10:36.360
So.
 Then I will take corn.

105
00:10:38.920 --> 00:10:42.000
Now to the fat itself.

106
00:10:42.160 --> 00:10:47.280
Hell, the cords I forgot!
 I can take them later.

107
00:10:54.680 --> 00:10:57.840
Then just wait again, then.

108
00:11:01.680 --> 00:11:07.080
You can put them just outside the kitchen window, and learn the names.

109
00:11:07.240 --> 00:11:11.120
Side tail, Rödhake ...

110
00:11:11.280 --> 00:11:15.880
-Greenfinch.
 Yellow-hammer.
 -Greenfinch.
 Yellow-hammer.

111
00:11:16.040 --> 00:11:18.840
- Screaming.
 - Screaming.

112
00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:20.960
- Arrow.
 - Arrow.

113
00:11:21.120 --> 00:11:24.200
- red hook.
 - I've said that.

114
00:11:24.360 --> 00:11:28.240
Now it must have solidified.
 Nämen look.

115
00:11:29.320 --> 00:11:32.320
Now the birds can come and ...

116
00:11:33.960 --> 00:11:36.080
...eat.

117
00:11:39.680 --> 00:11:43.520
I'll probably lie down for a while.

118
00:11:46.640 --> 00:11:50.320
Wake me tomorrow when they have solidified.

119
00:11:50.480 --> 00:11:55.040
They don't have to solidify until Christmas Eve.

120
00:12:01.800 --> 00:12:05.480
You live closer to nature in the countryside.

121
00:12:05.640 --> 00:12:10.600
Before you live here, it is probably a little difficult to understand what it means.

122
00:12:10.760 --> 00:12:16.400
But you look differently at the world here.
 You see the seasons come and go.

123
00:12:16.560 --> 00:12:23.520
I sound old now, but you get as a relationship with the wild animals.

124
00:12:23.680 --> 00:12:26.760
Like when waiting for the cereals -

125
00:12:26.920 --> 00:12:32.280
- Or now in the winter when you fix food for the birds that have stayed.

126
00:12:36.520 --> 00:12:41.920
I am a bit behind in fixing for Christmas, so it is important to maximize.

127
00:12:42.080 --> 00:12:46.400
Can anything maximize Christmas more than casting your own light?

128
00:12:46.560 --> 00:12:50.320
Stucking candles is the modern of all Christmas toys.

129
00:12:50.480 --> 00:12:55.240
Still, we don't do it that often, because it's hard.

130
00:12:55.400 --> 00:13:00.240
But I still try to do it.
 Maybe it's not that hard?

131
00:13:05.440 --> 00:13:08.480
Here is a saucepan of water.

132
00:13:08.640 --> 00:13:14.320
I will melt beeswax in the one, which will stand in a water bath.

133
00:13:14.480 --> 00:13:19.800
Flower stick with a lot of threads on.
 I will put it here.

134
00:13:19.960 --> 00:13:24.760
Then it was this with weight, so it becomes a straight light.

135
00:13:24.920 --> 00:13:28.520
A small nut.

136
00:13:28.680 --> 00:13:31.680
So, check out what straight.

137
00:13:31.840 --> 00:13:37.200
I thought it was like cutting through butter.
 There I mistaken.

138
00:13:38.720 --> 00:13:41.360
No, bad ...

139
00:13:41.520 --> 00:13:48.080
Now I have picked up the heavy artillery.
 I'll be ax apart it.

140
00:13:56.760 --> 00:14:01.240
- Hi, Kalle.
 We will cast light.
 -How cozy.

141
00:14:01.400 --> 00:14:06.240
- Do you make light?
 -Yes.
 You should too, if you want.

142
00:14:06.400 --> 00:14:10.640
-Of course I want to.
 - If I ax a little first ...

143
00:14:10.800 --> 00:14:14.080
Oh.

144
00:14:25.600 --> 00:14:31.800
Essa has given up a bit.
 But it is time to start dipping.
 Okay.

145
00:14:36.640 --> 00:14:43.240
What ...?
 This is already the nicest Christmas piece I have been with.

146
00:14:43.400 --> 00:14:46.080
Essa?
 Check.

147
00:14:46.240 --> 00:14:51.120
You dip like this, and then I hang this.

148
00:14:51.280 --> 00:14:54.760
- Do you want to test once?
 -Okay.

149
00:14:58.120 --> 00:15:01.040
<c.sang> We sit under the traps <c.sang> and the snow around us dizzy

150
00:15:01.200 --> 00:15:04.920
<c.sang> and not until evening <c.Sang> We journey home control

151
00:15:13.120 --> 00:15:15.520
Oops!

152
00:15:21.200 --> 00:15:23.360
An egg.

153
00:15:30.240 --> 00:15:35.360
Now I will test a thing that I have wanted to do quite a while:

154
00:15:35.520 --> 00:15:39.320
To marble the lights.
 Will it be full -

155
00:15:39.480 --> 00:15:44.560
- Unfortunately, I will set Christmas.
 Are you with me?
 One two Three!

156
00:15:45.680 --> 00:15:50.480
It is incredibly neat!
 It's like a psyched plot!

157
00:15:50.640 --> 00:15:53.680
Now I'm doing this.
 Cuts ...

158
00:15:55.040 --> 00:15:59.240
Yes, it's so nice!
 The nicest lights I've seen.

159
00:15:59.400 --> 00:16:05.440
<c.Teletext.sang> <c.sang> she brightened <c.sang> over the world's anxiety and battle ...

160
00:16:05.600 --> 00:16:08.600
What a Christmas miracle!

161
00:16:12.680 --> 00:16:15.240
Then we were running!

162
00:16:15.400 --> 00:16:20.920
Tomorrow we will see if the tall is solidified.
 Kalle gets to start with ham and sausage.

163
00:16:21.080 --> 00:16:25.760
I was going to start an alternative Christmas tradition.

164
00:16:25.920 --> 00:16:31.360
Jimmy and Anlin come here and cook with me.
 Fun!

165
00:16:42.520 --> 00:16:47.480
Now the sebaceous balls have hopefully solidified in the cold in here.

166
00:16:50.360 --> 00:16:53.640
Now let's see ... Check out!

167
00:16:53.800 --> 00:16:59.640
Birds do not eat with their eyes too but only with the beak?
 Hope so...

168
00:17:00.800 --> 00:17:05.600
We put it outside the window so we get fat stains on the window.

169
00:17:05.760 --> 00:17:11.160
It's so cosy.
 I have done this before with purchased sebum balls ...

170
00:17:21.680 --> 00:17:24.200
Tjoho!

171
00:17:24.360 --> 00:17:26.800
Powerful.

172
00:17:26.960 --> 00:17:31.040
I start well and bake.

173
00:17:37.680 --> 00:17:40.640
Time for Christmas ham.

174
00:17:40.800 --> 00:17:46.280
I put a pride in making a lot of food myself in the yard.

175
00:17:46.440 --> 00:17:51.400
Not everyone in the family thinks it is equal ... important.

176
00:17:51.560 --> 00:17:55.160
Buttocks from our hybrid cultures!

177
00:17:55.320 --> 00:18:01.120
I cooked the meat under pomp and standing and would invite the family.

178
00:18:01.280 --> 00:18:06.600
Brita does not eat pork.
 But maybe if it came from here?
 Absolutely not!

179
00:18:06.760 --> 00:18:13.200
Essa gave three thumbs down.
 Björn screamed: "Remove it from my plate!"

180
00:18:14.480 --> 00:18:18.080
And ... there is moose.
 The rest is pork.

181
00:18:18.240 --> 00:18:21.960
Hundreds of pounds no one wants to eat.

182
00:18:22.120 --> 00:18:27.640
But for Christmas you may be able to serve Christmas ham even if no one wants it.

183
00:18:27.800 --> 00:18:34.400
We will salt the meat.
 It gives taste, helps with the preservation -

184
00:18:34.560 --> 00:18:37.440
–And pulls out fluid?

185
00:18:39.280 --> 00:18:45.160
Okay, this is nitrite salt.
 According to some, it is hazardous -

186
00:18:45.320 --> 00:18:52.240
- But it is bactericidal and causes the ham to retain its pink color.

187
00:18:52.400 --> 00:18:56.880
Then there will be no dangerous bacteria in the ham.

188
00:18:57.040 --> 00:19:03.800
If we have nine kilos of water ... we should have 5 % plain salt, 3 % nitrite salt.

189
00:19:03.920 --> 00:19:07.560
450 grams of sea salt.
 Nitrite salt: 270.

190
00:19:07.720 --> 00:19:11.440
I am afraid of nitrite and take less.

191
00:19:11.600 --> 00:19:17.280
230 grams.
 So damn stupid ... sugar.
 I don't know how much you should have.

192
00:19:17.440 --> 00:19:20.400
Now we put in the buttocks.

193
00:19:23.360 --> 00:19:28.920
You want them under the surface.
 So!
 Just to wait, four and a half days.

194
00:19:30.440 --> 00:19:34.880
Another classic on the Christmas table is pig feet.

195
00:19:36.120 --> 00:19:38.840
I only have one.

196
00:19:39.000 --> 00:19:44.840
But it must be the foot itself.
 Right?
 - What is it, Hanne?

197
00:19:45.840 --> 00:19:48.440
Hanne?

198
00:19:48.600 --> 00:19:52.160
Oh yeah!
 Disgusting!

199
00:19:52.320 --> 00:19:56.440
<c.Teletext.sang> <c.sang> Mele kalikimaka 'is the thing to say

200
00:19:56.600 --> 00:20:00.400
<c.Teletext.sang> <c.sang> on a Bright <c.sang> Hawaiian Christmas Day ...

201
00:20:00.560 --> 00:20:05.320
Kalle has cooked quite a lot of pork.
 I don't eat pork.

202
00:20:05.480 --> 00:20:11.640
My way of creating Christmas peace in this house is to approach another meat -

203
00:20:11.800 --> 00:20:15.720
- which also Kalle is aware of: the ducks.

204
00:20:15.880 --> 00:20:21.640
I will take the duck meat, which I have not yet eaten anything really good ...

205
00:20:21.800 --> 00:20:27.360
Therefore, I have invited reinforcement in the form of Jimmy and Anlin.

206
00:20:28.600 --> 00:20:32.040
Thanks.
 Very nice to be here!

207
00:20:32.200 --> 00:20:35.600
This is Jimmy Guo and his mother.

208
00:20:35.760 --> 00:20:41.800
Jimmy is a master chef finalist, expert on Chinese food and generally wonderful.

209
00:20:41.960 --> 00:20:45.920
His mother then?
 She is the champion champion!

210
00:20:48.440 --> 00:20:52.320
- You are professionals on Duck.
 -I am.

211
00:20:52.480 --> 00:20:57.200
Mom cooks duck every Christmas.
 It is our Christmas tradition.

212
00:20:57.360 --> 00:21:03.000
In Chinese cuisine there are two known ducks.
 One is the Beijingankan -

213
00:21:03.160 --> 00:21:09.640
- Which is very time consuming ... there is nothing you do at home!

214
00:21:09.800 --> 00:21:15.880
The other known duck comes from Nanjing, which Mom comes from.

215
00:21:16.040 --> 00:21:22.080
I grew up at that time.
 It is very special for me.

216
00:21:22.240 --> 00:21:26.800
It is called rhymed blasted duck from nanjing.

217
00:21:26.960 --> 00:21:31.760
- How do you "blast" it?
 - It is very undramatic:

218
00:21:31.920 --> 00:21:37.960
It should be salted properly.
 The salt pulls the liquid out of the protein.

219
00:21:38.120 --> 00:21:42.520
After an hour, it starts to be sucked back.

220
00:21:42.680 --> 00:21:48.240
And then the cells retain moisture, or water, harder than before.

221
00:21:48.400 --> 00:21:53.400
- I didn't know this.
 - So you have time: Salt in good time.

222
00:21:53.560 --> 00:21:58.160
- I have chosen a fluffy sea salt.
 - It's like snow!

223
00:21:58.320 --> 00:22:02.840
Mostly because it is wonderful to work with and attaches well.

224
00:22:03.000 --> 00:22:06.400
But you can take quite the usual salt.

225
00:22:16.240 --> 00:22:21.960
Today it will be great fun, because today we will make Christmas sausage ...

226
00:22:22.120 --> 00:22:27.600
... together with the oracle from Sunne!
 Finally!

227
00:22:27.760 --> 00:22:33.760
Patrick Sellman is the all -artist's all -artist.
 He knows everything - everything -

228
00:22:33.920 --> 00:22:39.720
- About farm life, prepping, animals and food.
 Tighten you, good people.
 Here he is!

229
00:22:39.880 --> 00:22:45.760
Here we have back fat from pig.
 It is a lot of pig products.

230
00:22:45.920 --> 00:22:50.760
Historically, the pig was the resource that stood ...

231
00:22:50.920 --> 00:22:54.880
You did not have many pigs, but a few.

232
00:22:55.040 --> 00:23:00.240
It was a way to take advantage of food debris that you gave to the pig.

233
00:23:00.400 --> 00:23:03.400
And it is in the season.

234
00:23:03.560 --> 00:23:08.040
Then it is slaughtered when the temperature drops - before Christmas.

235
00:23:08.200 --> 00:23:12.200
And then there will be different sausages, ham ...

236
00:23:12.360 --> 00:23:17.920
... pig feet, dip in the pot - all that.

237
00:23:18.080 --> 00:23:23.240
Okay.
 Christmas sausage then, it's pork - or some other meat ...

238
00:23:23.400 --> 00:23:28.880
Some fat ... and then there are pepper, white pepper ...

239
00:23:29.040 --> 00:23:32.200
And onions.
 Good!

240
00:23:32.360 --> 00:23:37.040
We failed the onion cultivation this year.
 We forgot to put onions.

241
00:23:37.200 --> 00:23:42.000
- Then it will be unsuccessful!
 - Don't let us dig into it!

242
00:23:42.160 --> 00:23:47.440
Without let's make Christmas sausages.
 Okay!
 Then we will grind meat.

243
00:23:52.280 --> 00:23:56.800
You, I think we should have a little more fat in.

244
00:24:00.040 --> 00:24:02.920
–2 090 grams.
 -Perfect.

245
00:24:03.080 --> 00:24:06.800
- Onions?
 - Now we'll have it.

246
00:24:13.200 --> 00:24:19.560
What we will do today is to roast salt with sichuan pepper.

247
00:24:19.720 --> 00:24:25.840
You have to.
 When it is lukewarm you massage the salt into the duck.

248
00:24:26.000 --> 00:24:32.240
- Then it gets easier into the meat.
 - You should have type ... two fists on the outside.

249
00:24:32.400 --> 00:24:36.480
And a fist for the back.
 It feels reasonable.

250
00:24:36.640 --> 00:24:42.640
- Was he always good at cooking?
 - He has become there lately.

251
00:24:42.800 --> 00:24:47.840
Well, we have seen that in various chef competitions ...

252
00:24:48.000 --> 00:24:54.000
- He knows much more than I can.
 - Sized words from mom!

253
00:24:54.160 --> 00:24:59.600
We usually argue about how to make the duck, and mom wins.

254
00:24:59.760 --> 00:25:04.720
- Sometimes we have different discussions.
 - It's healthy.

255
00:25:04.880 --> 00:25:09.480
Now the salt is warm, so we drive in sichuan pepper.

256
00:25:09.640 --> 00:25:14.120
-God so tasty!
 - Salt is starting to yellow.

257
00:25:14.280 --> 00:25:20.040
It cools very fast.
 We start by throwing in a fist ...

258
00:25:20.200 --> 00:25:25.000
Don't just throw in!
 You should rub it in.

259
00:25:25.160 --> 00:25:30.760
It should be massaged.
 It's sharp legs - beware so you don't cut yourself.

260
00:25:37.320 --> 00:25:42.440
"A Christmas Glove" ... maybe the kids think is fun.

261
00:25:42.600 --> 00:25:48.280
-They are a little fucked-up that way.
 - Drive on here now!
 All the way in there.

262
00:25:50.760 --> 00:25:55.200
–Okay, hold it.
 - Now you can drive there.

263
00:25:56.360 --> 00:26:00.800
- You see how good I am on massage!
 -Really.

264
00:26:04.840 --> 00:26:08.600
- Salt, about 2.5 %.
 - Realon with salt.

265
00:26:08.760 --> 00:26:12.000
- Four grams.
 –And spice?

266
00:26:12.160 --> 00:26:15.120
- Something less.
 -Slightly.

267
00:26:18.440 --> 00:26:22.400
-What do you think?
 - It is well mixed.

268
00:26:23.600 --> 00:26:27.920
You have fun.
 I almost get jealous.

269
00:26:28.080 --> 00:26:32.520
Do you want to work?
 I have to dissolve some muscle ...

270
00:26:32.680 --> 00:26:35.320
The duck has had enough love now.

271
00:26:35.480 --> 00:26:39.600
- You have moved on until next week.
 -Yes!
 Thanks!

272
00:26:39.760 --> 00:26:45.000
Now we are placing it in and put it in the fridge.
 See you in a few days.

273
00:26:45.160 --> 00:26:49.200
At least two days it should stand in the fridge.

274
00:26:50.840 --> 00:26:53.560
Oh, beware!

275
00:26:54.960 --> 00:26:58.080
Kalle has tangled the intestines together!

276
00:26:58.240 --> 00:27:04.800
This is then gut from pig.
 As you have washed and salted.

277
00:27:04.960 --> 00:27:10.920
There are well-hit material today, but usually it is intestines around ...

278
00:27:13.120 --> 00:27:17.880
... around the sausage.
 Did you know that?
 Didn't you know that?

279
00:27:19.040 --> 00:27:23.800
- Think about it when you eat KROV.
 - Very synthetic today.

280
00:27:23.960 --> 00:27:27.320
You eat plastic instead ...

281
00:27:30.680 --> 00:27:37.560
Fill all the way so it goes up.
 I tie with cotton cord at the end.

282
00:27:37.720 --> 00:27:42.080
Good.
 Try!
 You have to get it in your hands.

283
00:27:42.240 --> 00:27:45.480
You should not hold too much.

284
00:27:49.600 --> 00:27:53.760
–Ekivokt ... - dip your hand in water.

285
00:28:02.200 --> 00:28:06.680
- There it was over.
 - You have missed an important ...

286
00:28:06.840 --> 00:28:09.200
- Testing.
 -Just!

287
00:28:12.160 --> 00:28:15.240
-Okay thanks.

288
00:28:18.640 --> 00:28:23.160
- Kalle ... you have made a merry Christmas sausage.
 - It was delicious!

289
00:28:23.320 --> 00:28:27.600
- I ... there will be really good sausage.
 - Fan, what fun!

290
00:28:29.120 --> 00:28:31.600
Yes!

291
00:28:34.480 --> 00:28:39.320
<c.teletext.sang> <c.sang> oh, Little Town of Bethlehem ...

292
00:28:39.480 --> 00:28:44.040
Now we are starting to get pretty ready for the Christmas party.

293
00:28:44.200 --> 00:28:50.320
The only thing missing is to make your own crispbread and make Christmas decorations.

294
00:28:50.480 --> 00:28:54.880
And you have to have a Christmas goat.
 Or?

295
00:29:03.240 --> 00:29:09.720
As happy as we were when the snow came, we were as sad when it was thawing.

296
00:29:09.880 --> 00:29:16.920
But we live in Sweden and are used to it.
 Kalle overcompensates with a Christmas goat.

297
00:29:21.840 --> 00:29:25.640
I'm going to build the body of this pallet.

298
00:29:25.800 --> 00:29:32.280
One challenge with living on a farm is to try to take what is close.

299
00:29:49.760 --> 00:29:52.680
So, so, so ...

300
00:29:58.040 --> 00:30:01.440
Here is a tradition around Christmas goats.

301
00:30:01.600 --> 00:30:07.360
When you were a kid, a youth gang came and put this on one's stairs.

302
00:30:07.520 --> 00:30:12.840
When you got out they threw snowballs on the window, so I got really scared.

303
00:30:13.000 --> 00:30:16.640
Then we would put the goat on someone else's stairs.

304
00:30:16.800 --> 00:30:22.880
There was a "relay" in Sorunda.
 This may be the beginning of it.

305
00:30:36.280 --> 00:30:38.480
Yes.

306
00:30:41.080 --> 00:30:47.080
Some kind of feud must have the goat too.
 Short Fejs ... or long?

307
00:31:03.960 --> 00:31:08.200
The tail will not be super performance!

308
00:31:10.880 --> 00:31:15.640
So damn uncomfortable with the head that sticks out!

309
00:31:16.320 --> 00:31:20.520
If someone is probably wanting to make a Christmas goat, then my tip is:

310
00:31:20.680 --> 00:31:23.720
Don't be afraid to take in the size!

311
00:31:23.880 --> 00:31:29.440
At the Christmas Bock Building Gymnasium, they said that the size has no significance.

312
00:31:29.600 --> 00:31:33.120
But I don't know if I agree.

313
00:31:39.640 --> 00:31:42.560
So!
 Much at work now, right?

314
00:31:42.720 --> 00:31:47.720
Should we take some in the pile?
 Then I busy it a little here back then.

315
00:31:50.880 --> 00:31:56.080
It's a bit like when you "mancapear" - hard to know when to quit.

316
00:31:56.240 --> 00:31:59.000
But now I'm starting to feel satisfied.

317
00:32:00.680 --> 00:32:05.320
So!
 The children may like to ride it.

318
00:32:12.120 --> 00:32:17.480
Soon Pernilla will come.
 She is an architect ...

319
00:32:18.480 --> 00:32:21.520
... and great at tinkering.

320
00:32:21.680 --> 00:32:26.200
I thought we would do some Christmas toys together.

321
00:32:33.640 --> 00:32:36.600
She is coming now.

322
00:32:37.600 --> 00:32:41.960
Hello!
 Oh, you have some straw with you, right?

323
00:32:42.120 --> 00:32:47.240
Just!
 And I have a Christmas present with me too.

324
00:32:47.400 --> 00:32:51.240
Pernilla Wåhlin Norén, architect and author.

325
00:32:51.400 --> 00:32:55.960
She is incredible on crafts.
 The crafts' Charlotte Kalla–

326
00:32:56.120 --> 00:33:00.120
- Fixing Galadriel, Pyssli's Princess Leia!

327
00:33:00.320 --> 00:33:06.320
- God, so nice!
 - From our summer sheep.

328
00:33:06.480 --> 00:33:12.840
I am very craving something that you do so damn nice, a straw ...

329
00:33:13.000 --> 00:33:18.000
A crown of straw.
 One can do the one that in the reach -

330
00:33:18.160 --> 00:33:24.560
- With a round frame and then it hangs down like a necklace.

331
00:33:24.720 --> 00:33:30.640
- Would you be able to make wool balls?
 -Oh yes!
 Yes, and I brought cards.

332
00:33:30.800 --> 00:33:33.720
I got shuddered by my own idea!

333
00:33:37.760 --> 00:33:40.640
Oh, what a nice one!

334
00:33:40.800 --> 00:33:43.920
They are very funny.

335
00:33:48.160 --> 00:33:52.000
No Christmas is complete without crispbread.

336
00:33:52.160 --> 00:33:57.560
It will go away to the silo and pick up some wheat.

337
00:33:57.560 --> 00:34:00.120
There we have it.

338
00:34:00.280 --> 00:34:04.320
- Now we're going to grind this.
 - Why should we grind it?

339
00:34:04.480 --> 00:34:07.560
It will be flour so we can bake.

340
00:34:11.040 --> 00:34:15.360
Today we will bake Christmas crackers.
 It is plain bread -

341
00:34:15.520 --> 00:34:18.640
- And then you have in anise and cumin ...

342
00:34:18.800 --> 00:34:23.320
Anis with I, your sick fucking.
 It's Christmas!

343
00:34:24.280 --> 00:34:28.360
To my help I have this piece, a mill.

344
00:34:28.520 --> 00:34:30.520
Okay!

345
00:34:45.120 --> 00:34:48.480
- Is this a "worry"?
 -Just.

346
00:34:48.640 --> 00:34:53.160
These in gold, which my daughter thought would be with -

347
00:34:53.320 --> 00:34:56.760
- Is the inside of a caviar can.

348
00:34:56.920 --> 00:35:02.000
She has made Christmas decorations off the inside of a caviar ...

349
00:35:02.160 --> 00:35:05.720
... a tube, and cut it up.
 They are gold inside.

350
00:35:05.880 --> 00:35:12.840
Immediately do your Christmas toys, whatever it is, of the inside of cavia art tubes!

351
00:35:13.000 --> 00:35:15.240
Right?

352
00:35:15.400 --> 00:35:20.040
Take a thread and then make a knot at the bottom.

353
00:35:20.200 --> 00:35:25.280
- You can, like Hälla ... - exact, pour it.

354
00:35:25.440 --> 00:35:32.080
The straw should be soaked for an hour before cutting.
 Then it does not break.

355
00:35:32.240 --> 00:35:35.240
There they get like that ...

356
00:35:35.400 --> 00:35:41.520
- Here you have to attach them together.
 - You can do with a spin.

357
00:35:41.680 --> 00:35:46.040
Yes absolutely.
 How nice not to have any knots.

358
00:35:46.200 --> 00:35:51.320
-Pro!
 The straw professional Brita!
 - Thanks, Miss.

359
00:35:51.480 --> 00:35:54.960
- But you have five children.
 -Yes.

360
00:35:55.840 --> 00:35:59.800
Just that ... it was just that.
 I have nothing more.

361
00:35:59.960 --> 00:36:05.120
I just wanted to say it and that we would think about it for a while.

362
00:36:11.360 --> 00:36:16.120
When I bake, I let the water decide how much flour ...

363
00:36:16.280 --> 00:36:21.160
I don't usually follow recipes so carefully.
 I pour in a variety of water.

364
00:36:21.320 --> 00:36:24.560
- That was maybe eight deciliters.
 -Milk?

365
00:36:24.720 --> 00:36:28.720
No, but you can pour in some flour.

366
00:36:31.080 --> 00:36:33.880
We have forgotten the yeast!

367
00:36:34.920 --> 00:36:38.400
Now the yeast will be dissolved.

368
00:36:38.560 --> 00:36:41.360
Now you can have more.

369
00:36:43.880 --> 00:36:47.480
Good, then you can get started.

370
00:36:47.640 --> 00:36:53.160
Then we will have in this kind of flour until it becomes a good dough ... Run on!

371
00:36:55.240 --> 00:37:00.320
- Check, a big lump!
 -Perfect.
 That's what we want.

372
00:37:08.120 --> 00:37:13.080
The only cartoon movie on TV when I was little was Kalle Duck on Christmas Eve.

373
00:37:13.240 --> 00:37:16.240
- you?!
 - No other cartoon.

374
00:37:16.400 --> 00:37:20.640
Otherwise, there were only aunts and uncles in the costume -

375
00:37:20.800 --> 00:37:24.000
- That talked about politics.

376
00:37:24.160 --> 00:37:28.600
-Ugh, how boring!
 - You are an adult now, Kalle.

377
00:37:28.760 --> 00:37:33.720
- I'm an adult now.
 - You are an adult.
 Then we will help you.

378
00:37:33.880 --> 00:37:36.920
You are so damn please!

379
00:37:44.160 --> 00:37:45.880
Check!

380
00:37:53.600 --> 00:37:55.840
Nice, of course!

381
00:37:56.000 --> 00:38:00.680
I felt that maybe I got a little blind in the craft.

382
00:38:00.840 --> 00:38:05.480
-I am very pleased.
 - In the heat of the craft.

383
00:38:06.960 --> 00:38:10.600
I saw that you had a straw in the barn.

384
00:38:10.760 --> 00:38:14.400
- Do you mean the goat now?
 -Yes.
 So fine!

385
00:38:14.560 --> 00:38:18.280
- It's a tradition here in the yard.
 -Is it true?!

386
00:38:18.440 --> 00:38:22.720
Kalle has done it.
 As of this year, it is a tradition.

387
00:38:22.880 --> 00:38:28.280
The cutest thing I know with Kalle is his tradition the Christmas stone.

388
00:38:28.440 --> 00:38:35.120
It is that he has a large, big stone that he carries a kilometer on Christmas day.

389
00:38:35.280 --> 00:38:40.000
He just wears it.
 End of tradition.

390
00:38:48.920 --> 00:38:55.080
This feels so fun.
 I think this will be ... so damn nice.

391
00:39:01.120 --> 00:39:04.760
- Pernilla, what have we created?
 -Right?!

392
00:39:04.920 --> 00:39:10.760
So nice!
 I think it's the nicest decoration someone ever seen.

393
00:39:10.920 --> 00:39:14.960
Very nice!
 Oh, I'm so embarrassed!

394
00:39:27.200 --> 00:39:31.600
Quite strong cumin smell.

395
00:39:33.440 --> 00:39:37.640
Dad!
 Is it going well?

396
00:39:37.800 --> 00:39:41.680
- Yes, how are you doing?
 -Not good.

397
00:39:41.840 --> 00:39:45.600
- The worst chaos.
 - Wounds what the children do in there.

398
00:39:45.760 --> 00:39:47.720
Exciting.

399
00:39:47.880 --> 00:39:50.560
Ah, Björn!

400
00:39:58.080 --> 00:40:02.560
You have to make a hole in the middle!
 That's what crispbread is.

401
00:40:02.720 --> 00:40:06.720
I realized you would have a hole.
 Surely it is perfect?

402
00:40:06.880 --> 00:40:09.040
Perfect.

403
00:40:17.640 --> 00:40:22.000
I don't like the cumin so much, I think.

404
00:40:28.360 --> 00:40:31.720
Are you craving crispbread?

405
00:40:40.560 --> 00:40:46.000
My five best tips when baking crispbread is:

406
00:40:53.720 --> 00:40:57.040
I have no more tips.

407
00:41:04.280 --> 00:41:08.880
- Now damn ... Yes!
 - Do you have crispbread?

408
00:41:09.040 --> 00:41:11.160
You are welcome!

409
00:41:11.320 --> 00:41:15.840
- Should you say it's good?
 -No.
 You can say as it is.

410
00:41:16.000 --> 00:41:22.320
-Thanks but no thanks.
 - Bear, just lick the butter now?

411
00:41:22.480 --> 00:41:27.240
Delicious!
 So you need crispbread, it's just to shout.

412
00:41:27.400 --> 00:41:31.480
Then I can bake it to you.

413
00:41:32.760 --> 00:41:35.360
Merry Christmas!

414
00:41:35.520 --> 00:41:39.400
We got a lot - crispbread, Christmas sausage, fine decoration -

415
00:41:39.560 --> 00:41:42.760
- ham, candle, goat, sebaceous balls, mulled wine ...

416
00:41:42.920 --> 00:41:48.200
Tomorrow comes relatives and friends at Christmas party.
 Mice!

417
00:41:53.000 --> 00:41:56.280
This year's most important decision is to choose the Christmas tree.

418
00:41:56.440 --> 00:42:02.600
We hand over that decision to those who decide.

419
00:42:02.760 --> 00:42:06.400
Yes, I'm talking about our beloved little children.

420
00:42:06.560 --> 00:42:09.680
Yes or no?
 Thumbs down.

421
00:42:09.840 --> 00:42:12.800
Essa, this one then?

422
00:42:15.280 --> 00:42:20.800
Huh?
 It was thumbs up!
 Thumbs up for it.
 Okay.

423
00:42:28.240 --> 00:42:31.800
- Three chop and you lie '.
 -Yes.

424
00:42:32.680 --> 00:42:35.440
Huh?

425
00:42:35.600 --> 00:42:40.120
Children, check out what was in the Christmas tree.
 Björn, do you know what it is?

426
00:42:40.280 --> 00:42:45.680
- A bird's nest.
 - A real bird's nest.

427
00:42:45.840 --> 00:42:50.040
- We might be able to bring this home?
 -Yes.

428
00:42:50.200 --> 00:42:53.840
- And look at it.
 -Yes we can do that.

429
00:42:54.000 --> 00:42:58.320
We got a bird's nest with us and a Christmas tree.

430
00:43:24.080 --> 00:43:26.960
-Does it feel good?
 -Yes.

431
00:43:29.320 --> 00:43:35.000
We usually have the other Christmas tree foot.
 I go and pick it up.

432
00:43:39.320 --> 00:43:46.080
I do not get it.
 People have gone on the moon.
 We can split atoms.

433
00:43:46.240 --> 00:43:50.840
We can't ... humanity cannot solve the problem -

434
00:43:51.000 --> 00:43:57.800
- With a Christmas tree foot that can actually hold a spruce upright.
 It's not possible!

435
00:44:20.720 --> 00:44:23.680
It's a Christmas party today.
 To-to-doo.

436
00:44:23.840 --> 00:44:28.320
We have to fix a long table, because we have invited in each direction -

437
00:44:28.480 --> 00:44:31.400
- So there may be a few.

438
00:44:31.560 --> 00:44:36.840
Okay, good.
 Table setting and check that we have cutlery, plates and chairs.

439
00:44:37.000 --> 00:44:39.800
Then we start with it.

440
00:44:39.960 --> 00:44:41.920
Ho-Ho-Ho.

441
00:44:42.080 --> 00:44:48.560
<c.Teletext.sang> <c.sang> It's the Most Wonderful Time <C.Sang> of the year

442
00:44:48.720 --> 00:44:52.600
<c.teletext.sang> <c.sang> with the kids jingle belling <c.sang> and everyone telling you

443
00:44:52.760 --> 00:44:55.400
<c.teletext.sang> <c.sang> be of good cheer

444
00:44:55.560 --> 00:44:58.920
<c.teletext.sang> <c.sang> It's the Most Wonderful Time

445
00:44:59.080 --> 00:45:02.680
<c.Teletext.sang> <c.sang> Yes, The Most Wonderful Time

446
00:45:02.840 --> 00:45:06.040
<c.Teletext.sang> <c.sang> oh, The Most Wonderful Time ...

447
00:45:06.200 --> 00:45:10.120
It was a Christmas atmosphere.
 Just missing ...

448
00:45:14.880 --> 00:45:17.560
Fy damn, what a powerful!

449
00:45:21.160 --> 00:45:25.840
- Is it your Christmas ham you have done?
 - Christmas ham, if I can pray.

450
00:45:26.000 --> 00:45:32.600
Then we will make the grilling to the ham.
 Then we take an egg ...

451
00:45:33.680 --> 00:45:36.560
... and then we remove the egg white.

452
00:45:37.680 --> 00:45:41.000
Ah - it broke.
 So.

453
00:45:42.640 --> 00:45:46.160
And then we take sweet mustard.

454
00:45:48.360 --> 00:45:54.760
A little neighbor ... and then we take dijon.
 I take everything that is left in the jar.

455
00:45:54.920 --> 00:46:00.520
But it depends on how much you have left, so you have to think for yourself.

456
00:46:01.920 --> 00:46:07.400
There we have it.
 Then we brush on the mustard and egg mixture.

457
00:46:09.840 --> 00:46:12.800
Now it's the bread.

458
00:46:12.960 --> 00:46:16.560
Of course.
 A little while in the oven.

459
00:46:16.720 --> 00:46:20.000
It should only get color up here.

460
00:46:21.520 --> 00:46:24.280
It may take a quarter.

461
00:46:24.440 --> 00:46:26.560
Thank you.

462
00:46:28.000 --> 00:46:30.080
Hell!

463
00:46:35.240 --> 00:46:37.760
I burned it.

464
00:46:37.920 --> 00:46:43.320
But it can be extra good.
 Some things are good a little burnt.

465
00:46:43.480 --> 00:46:45.640
I am tasting.

466
00:46:51.360 --> 00:46:54.480
It is better when it is not burned.

467
00:46:54.640 --> 00:46:59.040
If I hadn't had another, this would have been a disaster!

468
00:46:59.200 --> 00:47:02.520
I'm setting a clock this time.

469
00:47:04.040 --> 00:47:10.440
I take an egg yolk mixed with mustard and dijon mustard.
 Then on with bread.

470
00:47:21.080 --> 00:47:24.720
I'll heat mulled wine.
 Bock!

471
00:47:25.800 --> 00:47:29.000
Hell, I was forgetting it.

472
00:47:31.080 --> 00:47:35.960
-Hello!
 - But hey!
 What Christmas.

473
00:47:36.120 --> 00:47:40.640
- Yes, it's still cozy.
 -Welcome.
 How nice you look.

474
00:47:40.800 --> 00:47:45.000
- What a mood.
 - Now Kalles Timer went.

475
00:47:45.160 --> 00:47:47.880
Wonder why he burns things.

476
00:47:49.080 --> 00:47:52.640
- It looks great.
 -Check!

477
00:47:54.800 --> 00:47:58.320
-Hello!
 -Merry Christmas.

478
00:48:00.160 --> 00:48:02.200
Kramis!

479
00:48:09.480 --> 00:48:11.680
Fresh.

480
00:48:11.840 --> 00:48:15.880
- How did it go with the ham?
 - I forgot again.

481
00:48:16.040 --> 00:48:18.280
I took it out.

482
00:48:18.440 --> 00:48:24.160
- The anchor is not finished, but smells good.
 - This is going to be super good.

483
00:48:24.320 --> 00:48:28.720
We will make a witch brew with a lot of spices.

484
00:48:28.880 --> 00:48:33.720
There are many chefs for this soup, so you may be able to ...

485
00:48:33.880 --> 00:48:37.320
I know this, and you the ham.

486
00:48:37.480 --> 00:48:42.920
Now we make this spice bag.
 So we have cinnamon and bay leaves ...

487
00:48:43.080 --> 00:48:46.440
This is a kind of white nutmeg.

488
00:48:46.600 --> 00:48:49.200
-Oh!
 - It smells great.

489
00:48:49.360 --> 00:48:53.960
This is an Angelicarot.
 It is reminiscent of ginseng.

490
00:48:54.120 --> 00:48:58.960
- And fennel seeds.
 - Why do you put them in one?

491
00:48:59.120 --> 00:49:03.360
It is easier to remove them, because you do not eat them.

492
00:49:03.520 --> 00:49:08.280
- As a small tea bag.
 -Just.
 It goes down there.

493
00:49:08.440 --> 00:49:14.160
Here we have flavor enhancers, MSG.
 "It's all good."

494
00:49:14.320 --> 00:49:19.520
Salt.
 This should be a five percent team, so 250 grams.

495
00:49:19.680 --> 00:49:22.840
So much.
 Now we will rinse the duck.

496
00:49:23.000 --> 00:49:26.680
We remove excess salt and peppercorns.

497
00:49:26.840 --> 00:49:31.400
Okay, fill the duck.
 You are used to this.

498
00:49:31.560 --> 00:49:34.560
It's just to drive in that.

499
00:49:34.720 --> 00:49:41.560
We wait for it to boil, so it may go about half an hour.

500
00:49:41.720 --> 00:49:44.560
Then I do some more.

501
00:49:49.120 --> 00:49:53.600
We play that Polly is friends with a Santa's

502
00:49:53.760 --> 00:49:56.800
- And the Santa Claus should visit.

503
00:50:07.160 --> 00:50:13.720
- Why can't it be open?
 - It boils, so the lid should be on.

504
00:50:13.880 --> 00:50:18.520
But if it boils when we are not here, it is your fault.

505
00:50:18.680 --> 00:50:23.320
It is important that you keep the same now at Christmas.

506
00:50:23.480 --> 00:50:27.440
No, but mom is responsible for this being good.

507
00:50:27.600 --> 00:50:33.480
- Lite family stress is well.
 - It is Jimmy who always fights.

508
00:50:56.920 --> 00:51:00.200
- Is there a beer somewhere?
 -If it exists!

509
00:51:00.360 --> 00:51:03.000
I think I have to have a beer.

510
00:51:08.440 --> 00:51:14.640
Now I'm going to make a food box.
 Mum and I did it in the summers -

511
00:51:14.800 --> 00:51:18.680
- But now it's Christmas, and then it works too.

512
00:51:18.840 --> 00:51:22.600
What is it in?
 It's Matjes, of course -

513
00:51:22.760 --> 00:51:28.280
- And eggs, cooked eggs, and then it is chives ...

514
00:51:29.680 --> 00:51:33.160
And then it's yellow onion.

515
00:51:33.320 --> 00:51:39.560
If you do it, it will be who when Jussi Björling runs high C: t in "Helga night".

516
00:51:39.720 --> 00:51:43.720
It is the feeling of Sandberg's Matjes box.

517
00:51:43.880 --> 00:51:48.160
- Enotically neat.
 - "It's A Christmas Miracle!"

518
00:51:50.000 --> 00:51:54.320
- I peel the eggs.
 -How nice.
 As an assistant.

519
00:51:57.400 --> 00:51:59.880
So.

520
00:52:00.040 --> 00:52:04.080
- Otherwise, this is perfect.
 - Fan, hard boiled.

521
00:52:04.240 --> 00:52:07.560
You had a job.
 We take over.

522
00:52:11.800 --> 00:52:17.920
Now the food is starting to get ready, and we will serve our homemade mulled wine.

523
00:52:18.840 --> 00:52:23.000
We will check if it has become bubbly.

524
00:52:28.840 --> 00:52:31.040
So.

525
00:52:36.840 --> 00:52:43.680
Hello and welcome!
 It's nice to see you all here at the Christmas celebration.

526
00:52:43.840 --> 00:52:49.120
- You drink mulled wine made on mead.
 - As you have done.

527
00:52:49.280 --> 00:52:53.800
- So bowl and Merry Christmas.
 -Merry Christmas!

528
00:53:03.320 --> 00:53:07.800
He is the real plot and has hired me to Tomtenisse.

529
00:53:07.960 --> 00:53:11.480
And me.
 We are Santa's now.

530
00:53:23.120 --> 00:53:29.480
I have never eaten Christmas sausages, because it seemed disgusting.
 But it was good.

531
00:53:29.640 --> 00:53:33.640
- A Merry Christmas sausage.
 - As Patrik has helped me do.

532
00:53:33.800 --> 00:53:37.120
I haven't made Christmas sausages ever!

533
00:53:37.280 --> 00:53:43.040
A tradition that does not come from the farm is to make blasted duck.

534
00:53:43.200 --> 00:53:49.400
It is from Anlin's hometown of Nanjing, and is with traditional Christmas spices.

535
00:53:49.560 --> 00:53:55.680
-Very good.
 - bowl for that.
 Thanks, everyone.
 Merry Christmas.

536
00:53:55.840 --> 00:54:01.320
<c.Teletext.sang> <c.sang> Hello, Santa Gubs, hit the glasses <c.Sang> and let's funny be!

537
00:54:01.480 --> 00:54:07.480
<c.Teletext.sang> <c.sang> A little time we live here <c.sang> with much effort and great trouble

538
00:54:07.640 --> 00:54:12.880
<c.Teletext.sang> <c.sang> Hello, Santa Gubs, hit the glasses <c.Sang> and let's funny be!

539
00:54:13.040 --> 00:54:15.480
Hello!
 Bowl.

540
00:54:36.800 --> 00:54:40.400
-Are there any nice children here?
 -Yes!

541
00:54:40.560 --> 00:54:43.480
Is it the plot that comes?

542
00:54:43.640 --> 00:54:47.200
- Is it the real plot?
 -Yes!

543
00:54:47.360 --> 00:54:52.800
Are you sure?
 So, the real, real plot?

544
00:54:52.960 --> 00:54:57.080
Merry Christmas, Essa, wishes the plot.
 - You are welcome.

545
00:54:58.240 --> 00:55:01.280
Merry Christmas, Sally, wishes the plot.

546
00:55:02.600 --> 00:55:06.840
- Good Christmas, Alma.
 Who is Alma?
 -That's me.

547
00:55:07.000 --> 00:55:09.320
Heaven luck, huh?

548
00:55:12.760 --> 00:55:16.520
A school bus and a truck.

549
00:55:17.320 --> 00:55:20.960
Then you can load and lift stuff.

550
00:55:29.200 --> 00:55:34.720
Then it's time for a Christmas concert.
 It's Glenn and Linn.

551
00:55:34.880 --> 00:55:40.480
Glenn is my big child and Linn is Andrea's big child.

552
00:55:40.640 --> 00:55:46.120
This is the new, slightly cooler generation that takes over.

553
00:55:47.600 --> 00:55:49.800
Here you go.

554
00:55:53.280 --> 00:55:58.760
<c.Teletext.sang> <c.sang> It was Christmas Eve, Babe

555
00:55:58.920 --> 00:56:02.320
<c.Teletext.sang> <c.sang> in the drunk tank

556
00:56:02.480 --> 00:56:09.120
<c.teletext.sang> <c.sang> an old man said to me: <c.sang> won't see anchor one

557
00:56:09.280 --> 00:56:12.600
<c.teletext.sang> <c.sang> and then he sang a song

558
00:56:12.760 --> 00:56:16.000
<c.teletext.sang> <c.sang> "The Rare Old Mountain Dew"

559
00:56:16.160 --> 00:56:23.320
<c.Teletext.sang> <c.sang> I Turned My Face Away, <C.Sang> and Dreamed About You

560
00:56:27.400 --> 00:56:33.080
<c.Teletext.sang> <c.sang> The Boys in the Nypd Choir <C.Sang> still singing "Galway Bay"

561
00:56:33.240 --> 00:56:38.240
<c.Teletext.sang> <c.sang> and the Bells are ringing out <c.sang> for Christmas Day

562
00:57:04.880 --> 00:57:09.680
What I hope you bring is to get your own traditions.

563
00:57:09.840 --> 00:57:14.920
You do as you please.
 Make the food you want, have the guests you want.

564
00:57:15.080 --> 00:57:22.360
The only common denominator is that you gather, have fun, eat something good.

565
00:57:22.520 --> 00:57:25.880
Like to season with anise ...

566
00:57:26.040 --> 00:57:30.360
--... cinnamon ... --... and carnation and ginger.

567
00:57:30.520 --> 00:57:35.080
It does not matter.
 Only they are involved, everything works out.

568
00:57:35.240 --> 00:57:40.440
-Do it.
 Start your own traditions.
 - We throw in new ones every year.

569
00:57:40.600 --> 00:57:44.320
Yes, but kind of that this is our family farm.

570
00:57:44.480 --> 00:57:48.680
- It has not been for many years.
 -For three years.

571
00:57:48.840 --> 00:57:52.240
I hope it is for 300 years.

572
00:57:53.920 --> 00:57:57.240
- Christmas Pussen.
 - It was everything from us.

573
00:57:57.400 --> 00:57:59.880
Have a really nice Christmas!

574
00:58:00.040 --> 00:58:07.680
If you know someone is sitting alone on Christmas and you have a chair over, invite.

575
00:58:07.840 --> 00:58:11.960
Do you light on it when I sit on it?!

576
00:58:14.160 --> 00:58:19.960
From all of us to all of you, a really Merry Christmas!

577
00:58:20.120 --> 00:58:23.440
-Have a good one.
 Kiss and hug!
 -Merry Christmas!

578
00:58:25.360 --> 00:58:27.480
Take it easy.

579
00:58:35.480 --> 00:58:37.640
