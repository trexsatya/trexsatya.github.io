00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:22.680
C.Teletext.kjekylk. soundbilly whines

2
00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:26.280
Billy, what is it?

3
00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:32.720
Are you sorry for Elin to move?

4
00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:36.320
Huh?

5
00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:39.440
Hörtu, Gubb ... Billy.

6
00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:45.200
I'll go and talk to her, so maybe she stops.

7
00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:50.400
Don't worry, Billy.
 I go and talk to her.

8
00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:09.080
- Hi, Leif!
 -Hello.

9
00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:12.360
How is it?
 You look a bit sad.

10
00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:18.000
Yes, but what the hell.
 Do you have to move?
 Billy is shit.

11
00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:26.120
I have no job here, and can't say no to the service in Stockholm.

12
00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:30.440
What the hell, you can work with us.

13
00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:36.440
–And do what then?
 - You can change roof tiles on the house.

14
00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:42.360
–And what would the salary be?
 -We can divide the A-box into three, maybe.

15
00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:51.880
- You realize that it is not possible?
 - Yes, but tell us if we can do something.

16
00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:57.640
C.Teletext.urfjarran Russian spy with connections to the Russian intelligence service -

17
00:01:57.800 --> 00:02:00.440
C.Teletext.urfjarran - is free in the county.

18
00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:05.320
C.Teletext.urfjarranhan is suspected to have stolen documents relating to the security of the kingdom.

19
00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:11.120
C.Teletext.urfjarransäpo now goes out with a search for the man, who is in his 30s-

20
00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:16.640
C.Teletext.urfjarran - Has green eyes, light brown hair and is about 185 cm long.

21
00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:20.400
C.Tetetext.urfjarransäpo urges everyone to be attentive -

22
00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:25.160
C.Teletext.urfjarran - and tip the police if you see something suspicious.

23
00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:29.280
Now it is important to be on guard.

24
00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:35.280
But as I said, tell us if you need help with something and we will solve it.

25
00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:41.120
You look nice.
 But my brother is on his way here to help me.

26
00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:45.760
–What any ... - thank you.
 Greeting Billy.

27
00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:48.800
I will.
 Bye.

28
00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:04.480
Do you workout?
 You are quite breathless.

29
00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:08.440
- You have to see one thing.
 -Not now.

30
00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:15.080
Leif, silent.
 Stop.
 You have to follow down in the basement and see one thing.

31
00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:18.360
Follow.
 Just come along!

32
00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:21.640
-What's with you?
 -Go!

33
00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:27.880
-What the hell?
 -It is the Russian spy.

34
00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:33.320
I heard about it on the radio, and then it knocked on the door.

35
00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:36.920
I recognized him right away.

36
00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:41.760
He asked if he could come in and borrow the phone.

37
00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:47.920
-And then?
 He is completely knocked out.
 - I ran and picked up the bridge.

38
00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:53.200
I slammed at him at the Atlas so that he went on the slopes.

39
00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:57.880
-Satan!
 Well done, Billy.
 -Thanks.

40
00:03:58.040 --> 00:04:04.160
- ELIN will see us as heroes.
 - I also thought about it.

41
00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:10.280
- But what are we doing now?
 Calling the police?
 - No, fuck!
 Are you mad?

42
00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:16.640
- They said on the radio ... - reality is something completely different.

43
00:04:16.800 --> 00:04:19.800
This is corruption at the highest level.

44
00:04:19.960 --> 00:04:24.720
It's Spetsnaz, Säpo, Cia, FBI, Obama, Bush, Putin ...

45
00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:29.760
The whole league is after us.
 If we go to the police, we will be the target.

46
00:04:29.920 --> 00:04:35.240
It is only a matter of time before we have laser pointer in every window.

47
00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:40.240
Now we take him to Säpo.
 That's the only thing we can do.

48
00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:45.080
- How to do it?
 - We check that he is not bugging.

49
00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:51.040
Then we build a provisional prison camp and begin the hearings.

50
00:04:51.200 --> 00:04:55.200
We have to be damn low now.

51
00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:08.400
Now we run a classic tactic: "Good cop, Bad Cop."

52
00:05:08.560 --> 00:05:12.800
- What am I, then?
 - "Good", of course.

53
00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:18.880
- Imagine if I want to be "bad cop", then?
 - The brain!
 You don't have that pondus.

54
00:05:19.040 --> 00:05:23.040
I'm "bad cop", and you're "good".

55
00:05:23.200 --> 00:05:27.000
Are you in?
 Then I throw water.

56
00:05:31.480 --> 00:05:39.760
Yes ... Hello, Mr. Spy.
 My name is "Biley", and this is my brother ...

57
00:05:39.920 --> 00:05:44.320
Quiet, Billy ... Bond.
 Mr Bond, be quiet.

58
00:05:44.480 --> 00:05:49.360
- You should not say our names.
 -Sorry.

59
00:05:49.520 --> 00:05:53.280
So you want to play cool and tough?

60
00:05:53.440 --> 00:05:58.400
You want to play tough with us, two agents from Sweden?

61
00:05:58.560 --> 00:06:03.400
Yeah, Little Russian Fucker.
 Have you see Pure Evil Before?

62
00:06:03.560 --> 00:06:08.440
Just look into these eyes.
 Karate King 600, SUCK MY ASS!

63
00:06:08.600 --> 00:06:13.000
Suck my fucking ass, you fucking little boy.

64
00:06:13.160 --> 00:06:19.320
You think you can come here and fuck with us?
 You Russian Ass!

65
00:06:28.080 --> 00:06:31.760
Shit.
 Take it easy, agent Öhman.

66
00:06:31.920 --> 00:06:35.120
In Almost Broke The Whole Prison.

67
00:06:37.520 --> 00:06:43.240
Damn, nothing seems to bite him.
 We may try to come up with something new.

68
00:06:43.400 --> 00:06:48.400
- What should we do, Leif?
 - We are allowed to run water harvester.

69
00:06:48.560 --> 00:06:53.920
- Isn't it a little hard?
 - Kingdom security is at stake.

70
00:06:54.080 --> 00:06:58.600
We drive hard towards hard.
 Now it must be so.

71
00:07:00.680 --> 00:07:04.560
What do you say now, Russian Spy-Man?

72
00:07:08.520 --> 00:07:13.120
Exactly.
 Maybe you don't feel anything now -

73
00:07:13.280 --> 00:07:18.640
- Bet in one hour or two, or three, it's going to Hurt Real Bad.

74
00:07:18.800 --> 00:07:23.880
Yeah, Insane.
 Crazy in the brain.
 It's Water Torture.

75
00:07:24.040 --> 00:07:26.960
"Boom" on your forehead.

76
00:07:27.120 --> 00:07:32.080
So it's better for you to tell us where the chair documents are.

77
00:07:32.240 --> 00:07:36.400
Do like this if you are going to tell us.

78
00:07:39.720 --> 00:07:43.960
Damn, it doesn't work.
 Should I tickle him?

79
00:07:44.120 --> 00:07:48.680
Are you nuts?
 You can't go into the cage with him!

80
00:07:48.840 --> 00:07:54.280
I don't know if the torture works.
 We have to come up with something new.

81
00:07:54.440 --> 00:07:56.360
Stay.

82
00:07:56.760 --> 00:08:01.280
Damn, he's stiff.
 What should we do?

83
00:08:01.440 --> 00:08:08.440
We can bring him to Stockholm, to Säpo.
 No middlemen.

84
00:08:08.600 --> 00:08:13.680
I go and drill an air hole in the luggage lid.
 You may keep guard.

85
00:08:13.840 --> 00:08:17.000
We have to bring him there.
 Good.

86
00:08:21.280 --> 00:08:25.440
-Leif!
 -Hi Elin.

87
00:08:25.600 --> 00:08:28.120
What have you done?

88
00:08:28.280 --> 00:08:32.760
I clean the luggage lid.
 We will transport a thing.

89
00:08:32.920 --> 00:08:37.040
- You look totally sick!
 - Yeah ... oh, damn.

90
00:08:37.200 --> 00:08:44.040
I've got some little psoriasis ... it dries together when it's cold.

91
00:08:44.200 --> 00:08:50.040
-What are you doing then?
 - I wait for my brother.

92
00:08:50.200 --> 00:08:54.800
He would have been here four hours ago.

93
00:08:57.080 --> 00:09:01.960
- For four hours ago?
 - He would help me with the move.

94
00:09:02.120 --> 00:09:06.920
His phone is off.
 I'm starting to get worried.

95
00:09:07.080 --> 00:09:10.400
You haven't seen or heard anything?

96
00:09:11.920 --> 00:09:15.520
No.
 What does he look like, then?

97
00:09:15.680 --> 00:09:20.600
We are quite different.
 He is tall and has brown hair.

98
00:09:20.760 --> 00:09:25.600
Is he clever and a little well -trained at the same time?

99
00:09:25.760 --> 00:09:28.720
Yes ... yes, he is enough.

100
00:09:28.880 --> 00:09:32.840
Blue jacket - could he have it?

101
00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:39.440
- He could definitely have that.
 -Okay.
 No, I haven't seen anything.

102
00:09:40.520 --> 00:09:46.440
I must go.
 It starts to burn, so I have to change protective capsule.

103
00:09:46.600 --> 00:09:53.040
I was going to ask ... can you help me a little?
 There is quite a lot to wear.

104
00:09:53.200 --> 00:09:59.200
Not now, as I said.
 I have to in and lubricate ... the whole body.

105
00:09:59.360 --> 00:10:05.440
But you, what is the brother's name?
 I might bump into him on the road.

106
00:10:05.600 --> 00:10:10.640
–Emil Grönstedt.
 - Yes, we must be heard later.

107
00:10:10.800 --> 00:10:14.080
- Now it burns on.
 - Health Billy.

108
00:10:14.240 --> 00:10:18.160
He has not seen anything either.

109
00:10:19.760 --> 00:10:23.760
What do you say now, you russian bitch?

110
00:10:23.920 --> 00:10:26.720
-Quiet.
 –Look Who's Here.

111
00:10:26.880 --> 00:10:31.840
- My Brother's Going to Fuck You Up ... - Billy!
 Stop it.

112
00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:37.080
- I ran at Elin out here.
 - You told the spy?

113
00:10:37.240 --> 00:10:42.920
Do you remember that her brother would come and help her with the move?

114
00:10:43.080 --> 00:10:49.600
He has not appeared yet, and it is four hours since he would have arrived.

115
00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:54.760
Yes, what?

116
00:10:57.160 --> 00:11:00.480
Have you murdered Elin's brother, your bastard?!

117
00:11:00.640 --> 00:11:05.680
Are you nuts?
 Think about it now.
 That is Elin's brother.

118
00:11:09.200 --> 00:11:12.160
Is Elin's brother a spy?

119
00:11:12.320 --> 00:11:18.240
That is Elin's brother, and the spy is on the loose.
 Think about it.

120
00:11:19.480 --> 00:11:26.640
-Oh no.
 Damn, hell.
 What should we do?
 -Yes that...

121
00:11:26.800 --> 00:11:34.360
Hello - Hello.
 Or hello.
 There has been a little misunderstanding, you might say.

122
00:11:34.520 --> 00:11:41.960
If I move off the tape then maybe I can ask some control questions?

123
00:11:48.320 --> 00:11:50.520
Fy fuck ...

124
00:11:52.440 --> 00:11:58.040
- Is it you who is Emil Grönstedt?
 -Yes.
 What are you doing?!

125
00:11:58.200 --> 00:12:01.120
–And you are Elin's brother?
 -Yes.

126
00:12:01.280 --> 00:12:05.720
Why have you tied me up in a chicken farm?

127
00:12:05.880 --> 00:12:09.520
We thought you were a Russian spy.

128
00:12:09.680 --> 00:12:14.520
- Do I see as a Russian spy?
 -No I do not know.

129
00:12:14.680 --> 00:12:19.440
You have to be shy.
 - Go and heat some food.

130
00:12:19.600 --> 00:12:24.600
- I remove the cage.
 - You should get something good in the stomach.

131
00:12:24.760 --> 00:12:28.440
- Conduct ... - take the stuff now!

132
00:12:34.640 --> 00:12:41.040
Yes, Emil, we understand that you are angry and disappointed with us.

133
00:12:42.040 --> 00:12:46.200
I have some patch on the wounds here ...

134
00:12:46.360 --> 00:12:50.200
Should we really give him everything?

135
00:12:50.360 --> 00:12:56.440
Yes, we have to give him something.
 It's good if we take care of it nicely.

136
00:12:56.600 --> 00:12:59.480
Three thousand kronor.

137
00:13:02.120 --> 00:13:06.400
You can eat up the food in peace and quiet -

138
00:13:06.560 --> 00:13:11.400
- So we go to Elin and talk about everything that has happened.

139
00:13:11.560 --> 00:13:16.280
- Does it feel okay?
 - It's far from okay, but ...

140
00:13:16.440 --> 00:13:19.760
Go and do it now.

141
00:13:19.920 --> 00:13:23.960
Thanks so much, Emil.
 Sorry again.

142
00:13:26.480 --> 00:13:30.840
I take care of the talk, and we will see how it goes.

143
00:13:36.040 --> 00:13:38.560
Hello!
 Fine visit.

144
00:13:38.720 --> 00:13:43.840
Yes ... Can we get in and talk about a thing?

145
00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:47.000
Absolutely.
 Come in.

146
00:13:50.960 --> 00:13:54.160
Was it something special?

147
00:13:54.320 --> 00:14:00.320
Yes, at that Russian story and your brother who have not arrived.

148
00:14:00.480 --> 00:14:05.040
What a fucking clue he is.
 - Emil, come!

149
00:14:05.200 --> 00:14:10.960
His car paved five miles away, his phone is stone dead ...

150
00:14:11.120 --> 00:14:13.920
Hello!
 Emil.

151
00:14:15.520 --> 00:14:17.920
Leif and Billy.

152
00:14:18.080 --> 00:14:22.120
C.Teletext.urfjarranskanden after the Russian spy continues.

153
00:14:22.280 --> 00:14:27.080
C.Teletext.urfjarrannu Säpo goes out with a picture of the suspected man.

154
00:14:27.240 --> 00:14:33.080
C.Teletext.urfjarran Large sum is promised to the one whose tips lead to an arrest:

155
00:14:33.240 --> 00:14:37.120
C.Teletext.Surfjarrannaremare has set SEK 1.2 million.

156
00:14:38.040 --> 00:14:42.920
Damn how sick it runs around a spy ...

157
00:14:46.720 --> 00:14:48.600
Nice guys.

158
00:15:04.440 --> 00:15:10.240
God damn!

159
