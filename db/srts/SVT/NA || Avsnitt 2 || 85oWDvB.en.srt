- With Nasty Mac "Nasties".

13
00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:50.080
My name is Ahmed Berhan, The Hostess with the Mostest.

14
00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:53.840
These are our fantastic competitors.

15
00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:58.480
We have, the influence of the pink helicopter, Lars!

16
00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:04.000
No cub, she loves green.
 An applause for Louise!

17
00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:09.000
Train hosts from Hässleholm, at Orange: Johanna!

18
00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:16.040
Welcome.
 - Lars, you lecture on group dynamics in workplaces.

19
00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:22.480
How to handle difficult people.
 What awkward panelists do you take?

20
00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:28.160
- Tranos we start with.
 - He said Thanos!
 /Pronounces with "th"/

21
00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:33.560
- You've been to Kos.
 Rhodes -88.
 - He may be your dad.

22
00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:36.720
- Tyd, I'm flowing here.
 - Little Like.

23
00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:40.600
Feels like you have the same hairdresser.
 Same olive oil.

24
00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:43.480
This is just salt water.

25
00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:48.760
The Turkish steam sauna Hamam is now well established in Sweden.

26
00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:56.600
It is probably hammam for transgender people.

27
00:01:56.760 --> 00:02:01.320
I've never seen so many hold back a laugh.
 The audience ...

28
00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:04.120
/Suffocates laughs/

29
00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:08.960
Tamam, it's ... you've heard the word haram?

30
00:02:09.120 --> 00:02:15.440
If doing any haram, that person becomes tamed.
 Then there is ...

31
00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:21.080
You sometimes hear "coktamam".
 COK means a lot.

32
00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:25.520
That person is very much haram, or has done a lot of haram.

33
00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:29.560
Oh!
 Fantastically explained, but I don't think ... no.

34
00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:33.800
- But a fantastic explanation?
 - Well.

35
00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:36.600
- You think he is lying?
 -Yes.

36
00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:40.880
Congratulations, Lars, you have received your first point.

37
00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:47.240
False.
 Tamam has neither halal nor haram to do.

38
00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:53.440
Tamam means okay in both Turkish and Arabic.
 - Tamam?

39
00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:55.840
Tamam.

40
00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:01.880
Louise, I heard you love grass.
 Should you tell me what you are doing?

41
00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:07.520
I pick grass, take a loupe and a determination key and check species.

42
00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:11.240
The man, do you live in the 18th century?

43
00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:15.200
- You are a biologist.
 - You have to explain to them later.

44
00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:19.120
- What of the panelists are you picking?
 - I take Filip.

45
00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:21.120
I See You.

46
00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:28.640
Hi Svejsan, Svenne!

47
00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:36.040
You use it to communicate DHSS - "We will make a messy evening".

48
00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:41.560
Skåne and Stockholm are different.
 In Skåne it means "haram, liquor, sex".

49
00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:48.200
In Stockholm they say "haram, schlaif, sex".
 You should go out and make horhus.

50
00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:53.520
He nods.
 He just: "I've done it!"

51
00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:57.080
Imagine if it was so fun to do horhus.

52
00:03:57.240 --> 00:04:00.920
In other words, it's a chaotic evening.

53
00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:05.280
I want to believe you, but think you are lying.

54
00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:09.560
It feels like a strange abbreviation for it.

55
00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:13.400
What abbreviation do you have to strangle?

56
00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:17.240
!
 No I do not know.

57
00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:23.000
You think Filip is lying.
 You're doing right.
 Congratulations to your first point.

58
00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:28.800
HSS stands for "Hear nothing, see nothing, says nothing."
 So, don't go.

59
00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:32.440
An abbreviation for "Mind Your Fucking Business".
 - Johanna?

60
00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:36.680
- I choose Olivia.
 - Oh, fine.

61
00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:38.840
Olivia?

62
00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:44.320
Bleed.

63
00:04:44.480 --> 00:04:48.360
It's her favorite weeks.
 She doesn't have to do anything.

64
00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:52.960
Do not cook, not clean.
 The man takes care of everything.
 She gets chill.

65
00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:56.360
It's like an Islamic sick leave.

66
00:04:57.320 --> 00:05:01.120
She just: "Yes, I'll convert."

67
00:05:01.280 --> 00:05:04.640
She will google Shahada after this.

68
00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:11.680
- No, I don't believe you.
 -Right.
 You have also received a point.

69
00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:18.040
In Islam, a menstruating woman is considered unclean.
 She is not allowed to fast-

70
00:05:18.200 --> 00:05:23.200
- Driver the Qur'an or pray in the mosque.
 If you bleed, you go to leave.

71
00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:25.520
- Lars?
 –Evelyn.

72
00:05:25.680 --> 00:05:31.200
-Yes thank you.
 - What is it with Asians and thank you?

73
00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:35.440
You're here to get a fucking question.

74
00:05:35.600 --> 00:05:39.160
So, I'm bleeding now so I'm ...

75
00:05:39.320 --> 00:05:43.280
I'm very ... All over the place.

76
00:05:43.440 --> 00:05:48.360
That's why I'm dressed like I am feeling.

77
00:05:48.520 --> 00:05:50.720
–Evelyn?
 -Yes.

78
00:05:53.720 --> 00:05:58.400
The important question is well: How long do they intend to stay?

79
00:06:02.360 --> 00:06:05.440
Yes.
 The thing is ... the first Romans ...

80
00:06:05.600 --> 00:06:10.120
It's a little fun indeed.
 This year, Sweden will be 500 years old.

81
00:06:10.280 --> 00:06:15.040
But the first Romans have been here since 1512.

82
00:06:15.200 --> 00:06:21.480
So they have been here for 511 years.
 They have been here longer than Sweden has existed.

83
00:06:21.640 --> 00:06:27.280
The question is whether this is Sweden or whether it was Roman from the beginning.

84
00:06:27.440 --> 00:06:31.320
- mm.
 But that ... - I think you are right.

85
00:06:31.480 --> 00:06:35.760
You guess what Evelyn says is true.

86
00:06:35.920 --> 00:06:40.040
Congratulations, Lars.
 You've got one more point.

87
00:06:43.200 --> 00:06:49.160
30 Roma families came to Stockholm in 1512, according to an old protocol.

88
00:06:49.320 --> 00:06:53.920
The first known information about Roma in Sweden, and the first Rome Register.

89
00:06:54.080 --> 00:06:58.200
But definitely not the last.
 Congratulations to your second score.

90
00:06:58.360 --> 00:07:04.320
- We move on to Louise.
 –Yes.
 Then I take Samira.

91
00:07:04.480 --> 00:07:06.480
Samira?

92
00:07:10.480 --> 00:07:12.800
Blood pudding.

93
00:07:14.200 --> 00:07:19.480
- Check, how happy Thanos became.
 –Wa?
 Nämen, this is how it is.

94
00:07:19.640 --> 00:07:26.000
Many Somalis move back, or return, to Somalia.

95
00:07:26.160 --> 00:07:31.960
They have brought food with them.
 O'boy, buns and blood pudding.

96
00:07:33.640 --> 00:07:36.920
- Well!
 - No?

97
00:07:37.080 --> 00:07:40.600
I don't actually believe it.

98
00:07:40.760 --> 00:07:46.320
Think about how many animals are in Somalia that can make ... the dish.

99
00:07:46.480 --> 00:07:51.800
- I think you are lying.
 - She knows that blood pudding is disgusting.

100
00:07:51.960 --> 00:07:54.600
Congratulations!

101
00:07:54.760 --> 00:07:57.120
Louise has received one more point.

102
00:07:57.280 --> 00:08:00.040
Baasto is spaghetti and minced meat sauce.

103
00:08:00.200 --> 00:08:05.120
Italy colonized Somalia in the late 19th century and affected the food.

104
00:08:05.280 --> 00:08:09.720
It flows well.
 2–2–1.
 Are you going to bring home a point, Johanna?

105
00:08:09.880 --> 00:08:11.920
- What do you choose?
 - Sea.

106
00:08:12.080 --> 00:08:15.000
Hello Sweden.

107
00:08:15.160 --> 00:08:18.280
Chos-e file is Persian for popcorn.

108
00:08:20.760 --> 00:08:26.040
- Elephant bar.
 -For real?

109
00:08:26.200 --> 00:08:27.520
Yes.

110
00:08:27.680 --> 00:08:30.480
–That's it?
 -In other words...

111
00:08:31.400 --> 00:08:37.600
The company that exported popcorn to Iran was called Chesterfield.

112
00:08:37.760 --> 00:08:44.440
We Iranians are joking with them, so we call it Chos-e file.
 Elephant bar.

113
00:08:44.600 --> 00:08:50.840
It sounds too sick to be true, so I think it's true.

114
00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:55.680
You think they call popcorn for elephant bar?

115
00:08:55.840 --> 00:09:00.240
Congratulations, Johanna, you got one more point!

116
00:09:00.400 --> 00:09:03.400
C.Sangla-laj-la-laj-la-laj

117
00:09:07.080 --> 00:09:12.640
I love Persian.
 They look at popcorn and think elephant.

118
00:09:12.800 --> 00:09:16.520
Who doesn't like elephant guy, yes?
 In other words...

119
00:09:19.840 --> 00:09:23.080
-Lars, take it away.
 –Alaf.

120
00:09:23.240 --> 00:09:24.920
Yes.

121
00:09:34.040 --> 00:09:35.840
Yes...

122
00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:41.000
When immigrants came to Sweden and would receive their social security number -

123
00:09:41.160 --> 00:09:46.160
- But they did not know when they were born, they had to go to the Immigration Service -

124
00:09:46.320 --> 00:09:48.400
- And speculate when they were born.

125
00:09:48.560 --> 00:09:54.520
Those who thought they were born at the beginning of the year received January 1st -

126
00:09:54.680 --> 00:10:00.560
-And those who had late year-Vibe received July 1 as a social security number.

127
00:10:00.720 --> 00:10:04.520
- When were you born, Lars?
 –6 October.

128
00:10:04.680 --> 00:10:10.200
-You are swedish.
 -It is right.
 I believe you are right.

129
00:10:10.360 --> 00:10:14.720
Congratulations, Lars.
 Another point.
 Awesome work.

130
00:10:16.360 --> 00:10:18.400
What Elaf told us is true.

131
00:10:18.560 --> 00:10:23.800
Immigrants who have not known about their date of birth have received on 1 January -

132
00:10:23.960 --> 00:10:29.040
- If they were born at the beginning of the year, and July 1 during the second half.

133
00:10:29.200 --> 00:10:33.080
Check out your Facebook's birthday buddies on January 1st-

134
00:10:33.240 --> 00:10:38.200
–And see if you find someone named Gustav, Lena or Ingrid.
 - Louise?

135
00:10:38.360 --> 00:10:42.160
- It's just one left.
 Big O. - Skåne: Is it good with you?

136
00:10:42.320 --> 00:10:45.320
Skåne: Yes, that's good with me.

137
00:10:47.160 --> 00:10:49.640
Big o, time for a video question.

138
00:10:49.800 --> 00:10:51.840
/Ululates/

139
00:11:02.440 --> 00:11:07.920
- brother, where did I end up?
 -It's not ... /cords with the tongue /

140
00:11:09.120 --> 00:11:12.240
I have to go home and eat.
 Mom shouts.

141
00:11:16.040 --> 00:11:21.720
This is how we immigrants celebrate when we get a permanent residence permit.

142
00:11:30.840 --> 00:11:34.840
- "Congratulations, here is your 0101."
 -Exactly.

143
00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:39.160
No, but it's an old warning sound.

144
00:11:39.320 --> 00:11:44.600
When people lived in old villages and it was Robbish, robbery, going on -

145
00:11:44.760 --> 00:11:49.560
- They made the sound.
 "Come on, we're going to catch shonun. We'll yeah."

146
00:11:49.720 --> 00:11:52.280
Do you understand?

147
00:11:52.440 --> 00:11:58.480
Crime is committed.
 They made that sound to help, listen.

148
00:12:00.480 --> 00:12:05.280
- Yes, you are used to.
 - Tyst, yes!

149
00:12:05.440 --> 00:12:11.320
Filip, Filip!
 - Walla, I back you, brother.

150
00:12:11.480 --> 00:12:15.040
- A season I was with her.
 -Virus?

151
00:12:15.200 --> 00:12:20.960
- It's worse than Corona.
 - Should we give Louise the chance to answer?

152
00:12:21.120 --> 00:12:26.000
- I think it's false.
 - Strange voice: Aha.

153
00:12:28.480 --> 00:12:31.960
It was astonishing, hearing.

154
00:12:32.120 --> 00:12:36.760
–Louise, you think it's false?
 -Yes.

155
00:12:36.920 --> 00:12:41.080
Good job, you've got one more point.

156
00:12:42.720 --> 00:12:48.280
It's false.
 Zaghrouta in Arabic is a sound to show joy.

157
00:12:48.440 --> 00:12:52.920
There is one for Zaghrouta clips, for who gets enough of Zaghrouta?

158
00:13:10.680 --> 00:13:13.360
I can not take it.

159
00:13:17.240 --> 00:13:22.240
YES!
 My ladies and gentlemen, as you see right now: full pot, full pot ...

160
00:13:22.400 --> 00:13:27.040
You have a question left, but the whole panel is consumed.

161
00:13:27.200 --> 00:13:32.080
Therefore, your last panelist will be ...

162
00:13:40.160 --> 00:13:41.800
Evelyn.

163
00:13:41.960 --> 00:13:45.960
- It's the first time I am.
 - Why are you lying for?!

164
00:13:46.120 --> 00:13:51.520
You traveled 31 times during the pandemic.
 You were stopped at the airport.

165
00:13:51.680 --> 00:13:55.920
Image question: What is the name of this serial album?

166
00:13:56.080 --> 00:13:59.280
Teddy bear and Kalle Black Skull.

167
00:14:00.880 --> 00:14:04.200
It sounds incredible, but that's true.

168
00:14:04.360 --> 00:14:10.720
It was an edition of Bamse as the Immigration Agency then -

169
00:14:10.880 --> 00:14:14.720
- It was called the Migration Board at the time ...

170
00:14:14.880 --> 00:14:21.240
They released this series to counteract that children at school -

171
00:14:21.400 --> 00:14:27.520
- Bully immigrant children.
 They thought it was a good idea.

172
00:14:27.680 --> 00:14:32.280
It was difficult.
 You are very convincing too.

173
00:14:32.440 --> 00:14:34.440
Thanks.

174
00:14:36.360 --> 00:14:41.560
- Well.
 Well, that's not true.
 - You don't think so?
 Okay.

175
00:14:41.720 --> 00:14:46.760
- Unfortunately, Johanna.
 No point.
 - Yes, that was true.

176
00:14:46.920 --> 00:14:49.520
It's true.
 Evelyn did not lie.

177
00:14:49.680 --> 00:14:53.920
The series album was named Bamse and Kalle Black Skull -

178
00:14:54.080 --> 00:14:58.800
- And was awarded in 1988 in schools by the Swedish National Immigration Service.

179
00:14:58.960 --> 00:15:02.560
The integration went really well there.

180
00:15:02.720 --> 00:15:08.280
Unfortunately, you only got 2 points.
 Thank you for joining.
 You don't move on.

181
00:15:08.440 --> 00:15:13.720
A large applause to Johanna, and to Lars and Louise who go to the final.

182
00:15:17.800 --> 00:15:22.400
Time for the final round.
 We have our finalists, Lars and Louise.

183
00:15:22.560 --> 00:15:26.560
Louise, you may start.
 It's like the first round -

184
00:15:26.720 --> 00:15:32.840
- Fast first to 5. If you answer the wrong, the point goes to the opponent.

185
00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:37.400
- Who do you choose to start with?
 - I choose Olivia.

186
00:15:37.560 --> 00:15:41.800
- Oh, what a honor.
 Thanks!
 -Olivia?

187
00:15:44.440 --> 00:15:50.440
An expression of sex addicts who love to have sex in different places.

188
00:15:50.600 --> 00:15:57.120
Outdoors, public places, with lots of people, the Eiffel Tower ...

189
00:15:58.360 --> 00:16:01.120
Like Filip.

190
00:16:01.280 --> 00:16:07.400
- Or like Olivia Bachelorette.
 - All: Oh!

191
00:16:07.560 --> 00:16:10.920
Oh!
 We went there!

192
00:16:11.080 --> 00:16:15.160
- What did you say it was called?
 - "Hunting Rabbit".

193
00:16:15.320 --> 00:16:19.320
Well, that sounds unlikely.
 I think it's false.

194
00:16:19.480 --> 00:16:23.720
- You don't think people have sex outdoors?
 -Yes.

195
00:16:23.880 --> 00:16:27.760
But not that it is called "chase rabbit"?

196
00:16:27.920 --> 00:16:33.360
You do that right in. Congratulations, Louise!

197
00:16:33.520 --> 00:16:36.480
"Rabbit" means SEK 1 million.

198
00:16:36.640 --> 00:16:41.840
It has nothing to do with it, but rabbit tastes chicken.

199
00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:44.800
So you know.

200
00:16:44.960 --> 00:16:48.800
- Lars?
 Who do you choose?
 - Sea.

201
00:16:48.960 --> 00:16:52.320
-Hello Sweden.
 -Hey you.

202
00:16:53.720 --> 00:16:57.120
You need to remind yourself which country you are in.

203
00:16:57.280 --> 00:17:00.200
You might go out.

204
00:17:01.440 --> 00:17:03.960
If you are invited to dinner by an Indian ...

205
00:17:07.800 --> 00:17:11.360
Naan of your business.

206
00:17:15.520 --> 00:17:18.440
Ah, I took a chance!

207
00:17:20.520 --> 00:17:26.040
This is how it is.
 The Indians were colonized by the British.

208
00:17:26.200 --> 00:17:29.680
The British brought forks and knives.

209
00:17:29.840 --> 00:17:33.680
The Indians said, "What are you doing here? We're not going to be like you."

210
00:17:33.840 --> 00:17:36.520
"We eat with our hands and feet."

211
00:17:36.680 --> 00:17:41.680
It has stuck and become a cultural thing, resistance.

212
00:17:41.840 --> 00:17:47.040
- To show: "We don't eat with a knife and fork. Fight the power."

213
00:17:48.280 --> 00:17:55.480
The explanation was completely crazy.
 But in some way that's right, I think.

214
00:17:55.640 --> 00:18:01.080
Does the Indians eat with their hands like an "act of rebellion"?

215
00:18:01.240 --> 00:18:06.040
Congratulations, Louise!
 You've got one more point.

216
00:18:07.880 --> 00:18:14.320
False.
 They eat with their fingers because it gives a more perfect dining experience.

217
00:18:14.480 --> 00:18:20.080
- Drecks on which you dry with.
 - You are not allowed to eat with the left.

218
00:18:20.240 --> 00:18:25.600
- There is an Indian saying ... - Wait, I'll just record.

219
00:18:25.760 --> 00:18:28.120
Thanks, Thanos.

220
00:18:37.200 --> 00:18:41.880
-I'm ready.
 - Giantbra.
 We can record too.

221
00:18:42.040 --> 00:18:45.280
- It sounds like this ... –Yes?

222
00:18:45.440 --> 00:18:52.240
Eating with a knife and fork is like watching one's beloved through an interpreter.

223
00:18:52.400 --> 00:18:56.440
- Who says this?
 - A Indian saying.

224
00:18:56.600 --> 00:18:59.400
I didn't hang out.

225
00:19:05.040 --> 00:19:08.680
- Thanks so much, Elaf.
 -You are welcome.

226
00:19:08.840 --> 00:19:12.640
- Louise?
 - What should I choose?

227
00:19:12.800 --> 00:19:16.480
-Thanos.
 –OKay, Frank.

228
00:19:19.600 --> 00:19:23.480
Thanos, what happens?
 How are you?

229
00:19:23.640 --> 00:19:27.400
I have a question for you, brother.

230
00:19:29.960 --> 00:19:32.640
11 September.

231
00:19:35.240 --> 00:19:37.480
Aaah!

232
00:19:41.040 --> 00:19:46.080
- See, the man.
 You are rough, the man.
 -Listen!
 I'm done there.

233
00:19:47.120 --> 00:19:51.760
I have nothing more to say.
 I know it was fantastic.

234
00:19:51.920 --> 00:19:55.760
-True or false?
 - It can't be true.

235
00:19:55.920 --> 00:19:59.600
- You think Thanos is lying?
 -Yes.

236
00:19:59.760 --> 00:20:04.120
Louise, you just gave a point to Lars.

237
00:20:06.320 --> 00:20:09.520
- you?!
 -What the hell?!

238
00:20:09.680 --> 00:20:13.440
You're joking!
 You're joking!

239
00:20:13.600 --> 00:20:15.720
Wait!
 They want to know!

240
00:20:15.880 --> 00:20:22.600
-I will explain.
 Wait.
 - See them, Ahmed!

241
00:20:22.760 --> 00:20:27.840
It's true.
 September 11 is the Kebab's day.

242
00:20:28.000 --> 00:20:33.320
But it's a bit like the chicken and the egg.
 Which came first?

243
00:20:33.480 --> 00:20:38.920
The Kebab's day came first.
 1980, September 11.

244
00:20:39.080 --> 00:20:42.280
-Yes Yes.
 -Exactly.

245
00:20:42.480 --> 00:20:47.520
So they bombed "9/11" during the Kebab's day?

246
00:20:47.680 --> 00:20:51.080
Yes.
 A pilot just thought they would have a kebab.

247
00:20:51.240 --> 00:20:55.400
Had the United States been aware of the day, "9/11" would not have happened.

248
00:20:55.560 --> 00:20:58.920
He might use his notes.

249
00:20:59.080 --> 00:21:03.840
Kebabens Day was established during the 1980s, September 11.

250
00:21:04.000 --> 00:21:07.640
Too bad we don't celebrate it anymore, then.

251
00:21:07.800 --> 00:21:11.200
Take it easy.
 I don't want to be cancelled.

252
00:21:11.360 --> 00:21:15.520
You can celebrate.
 Just buying two kebab rolls.

253
00:21:15.680 --> 00:21:17.880
Aah!

254
00:21:18.040 --> 00:21:22.160
- Many people there.
 - I had to think.

255
00:21:22.320 --> 00:21:27.160
But then I sharked!
 Two kebab rolls.
 Yes Yes.

256
00:21:27.320 --> 00:21:31.040
-I do not get it.
 - It's two towers.

257
00:21:31.200 --> 00:21:34.680
- Yeah!
 - Now you understand.

258
00:21:34.840 --> 00:21:39.520
Strong break: You say Chinese are very smart.
 Now you understand!

259
00:21:39.680 --> 00:21:45.280
It's because she bleeds.
 She has no blood in the brain.

260
00:21:45.440 --> 00:21:49.280
- Lars?
 - Filip.

261
00:21:50.200 --> 00:21:53.360
- What do you choose?
 -Me.
 Where the hell are you?

262
00:21:55.200 --> 00:21:57.200
A video question.

263
00:21:57.360 --> 00:22:03.240
I swear, I've paid.
 Kus Uktak Sharmota Telhas Tizi.

264
00:22:03.400 --> 00:22:09.040
We saw the entrepreneur and politician Jan Emanuel react negative -

265
00:22:09.200 --> 00:22:12.280
-On a parking fine, and started talking another language.

266
00:22:16.560 --> 00:22:21.720
He swore in Arabic.
 Words I don't repeat without getting a slipper at home.

267
00:22:21.880 --> 00:22:27.000
A nice mix of, simplified expressed, "a little prostitution-vibes".

268
00:22:27.160 --> 00:22:32.720
A mixture of buttocks, genitals and relatives in a lovely mix.

269
00:22:34.760 --> 00:22:36.760
Aah ...

270
00:22:36.920 --> 00:22:43.440
You usually mix religion and filth in really good swearing.

271
00:22:43.600 --> 00:22:47.480
- He is serious, he knows.
 - You think that's true?

272
00:22:47.640 --> 00:22:53.440
Lars said what Filip described was true.
 - Congratulations, Lars.
 A point.

273
00:22:55.960 --> 00:22:59.960
Jan Emanuel swore in Arabic with a mixture of various swearing -in

274
00:23:00.120 --> 00:23:03.880
- But his Arabic grammar was Bäh.

275
00:23:04.040 --> 00:23:08.280
- Louise?
 -Yes.
 Then I take Elaf.

276
00:23:15.040 --> 00:23:20.200
It is actually he who you can thank for -

277
00:23:20.360 --> 00:23:23.200
- That people like Olivia are here.

278
00:23:23.360 --> 00:23:27.560
All stylish half -gambians and half -Swedes.

279
00:23:27.720 --> 00:23:34.120
He started charter tourism between Sweden and Gambia.

280
00:23:34.280 --> 00:23:37.920
And a lot of single moms.

281
00:23:41.480 --> 00:23:45.040
Olivia will lower you afterwards.

282
00:23:46.520 --> 00:23:51.520
That is certainly true.
 Sounds sick, but I choose to believe you.

283
00:23:51.680 --> 00:23:54.680
-Racist.
 - You choose to believe ...?

284
00:23:57.080 --> 00:23:59.160
How nice.

285
00:23:59.320 --> 00:24:03.800
Despite Elaf's explanation, you were right to believe in her.
 Congratulations!

286
00:24:03.960 --> 00:24:06.840
You got one more point.

287
00:24:08.120 --> 00:24:09.560
Santo.

288
00:24:09.720 --> 00:24:14.480
Harding launched charter tourism to Gambia in the mid-60s.

289
00:24:14.640 --> 00:24:17.040
The father of gambian tourism.

290
00:24:17.200 --> 00:24:20.280
The highway is Bertil Harding Highway.

291
00:24:20.440 --> 00:24:23.520
Congratulations, Louise.
 - On to you, Lars.

292
00:24:23.680 --> 00:24:26.400
- Samira.
 -Hello.

293
00:24:26.560 --> 00:24:29.960
If you go on a date with a South Korean ...

294
00:24:30.120 --> 00:24:35.440
Who said I can't go on a date with a South Korean?

295
00:24:35.600 --> 00:24:37.440
Yalla.
 Sorry.

296
00:24:41.960 --> 00:24:44.840
If they want to turn kidneys.

297
00:24:45.960 --> 00:24:51.040
It's okay, it was I who wrote that joke.
 It's okay.

298
00:24:51.200 --> 00:24:54.120
It's true.
 For in South Korea–

299
00:24:54.280 --> 00:25:00.160
- Can not take organs or blood that is not of your family.

300
00:25:00.320 --> 00:25:05.800
Therefore, I need to know your blood group if I need something from you.

301
00:25:07.360 --> 00:25:12.360
I don't think you ask it on a date, but you are right.

302
00:25:12.520 --> 00:25:16.000
Unfortunately, Lars, it was false.

303
00:25:16.160 --> 00:25:19.760
Congratulations, Louise.
 One more point.

304
00:25:19.920 --> 00:25:23.600
South Koreans ask for blood type on dating -

305
00:25:23.760 --> 00:25:28.200
- Because they think it can determine how to match as a person.

306
00:25:28.360 --> 00:25:30.480
It is their horoscope garden.

307
00:25:31.840 --> 00:25:36.240
"Are you an astronaut?"
 It's not a zodiac sign.
 Sorry.

308
00:25:36.400 --> 00:25:39.920
Are you an astronaut?
 Huh?

309
00:25:41.920 --> 00:25:45.280
So, it's just something mentally.

310
00:25:46.360 --> 00:25:48.360
Hey ...

311
00:25:48.520 --> 00:25:53.000
Now, as we see on the scoreboard, Louise has four points.

312
00:25:53.160 --> 00:25:56.800
If you answer correctly, you win the whole thing.

313
00:25:56.960 --> 00:26:02.640
Okay.
 Who should I choose?
 - Then I trust you, Evelyn.

314
00:26:02.800 --> 00:26:06.360
-Thanks.
 –Evelyn?

315
00:26:09.680 --> 00:26:13.160
What Thanos shouts when he comes.

316
00:26:16.600 --> 00:26:22.160
Surely, Thanos feels like a guy who looks in the mirror when he comes?

317
00:26:22.320 --> 00:26:26.040
/Ahmed moans/

318
00:26:27.840 --> 00:26:30.320
- fun.
 - Trauma treatment after this.

319
00:26:30.480 --> 00:26:36.360
Fakelaki is something that you have heard when you have vacationed in Greece.

320
00:26:36.520 --> 00:26:38.960
Or, I've heard it.

321
00:26:39.120 --> 00:26:43.800
It is a term for a Greek guy who goes home with the women.

322
00:26:43.960 --> 00:26:46.880
A Greek Player.

323
00:26:47.040 --> 00:26:52.720
You hear fuck.
 It is English, but you have Greek it a bit.

324
00:26:52.880 --> 00:26:59.080
Fake-laki.
 Not to be confused with Asian "Fucky Lucky Long Time".

325
00:26:59.240 --> 00:27:03.240
So ... it is greek.

326
00:27:03.400 --> 00:27:08.000
- No ... I don't believe that.
 - You think it's false.

327
00:27:08.160 --> 00:27:13.480
You seem safe.
 Have you met a Greek beach raw?

328
00:27:13.640 --> 00:27:18.280
-No never.
 - She answered, then ... /stifled giggly /
