1
00:00:04.520 --> 00:00:09.040
In tonight's section of Ifs - immigrants for Swedes:

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:12.080
Gothenburg's best Somalis: Assia Dahir.

Greek from Alby: Thanos Fotas.

Sweden's second best celebrity dancer: Filip Dikmen.

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:21.680
The world's Swedish Arab: Elaf Ali.

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:25.200
The Kimonotwitch Radio Patcher: Victor Linnér.

00:00:25.360 --> 00:00:27.840
Sweden's most fun Chinese: Evelyn Mok.

The tour leader who became Punchline winner Ato "The Champ" Karlsson.

00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:35.920
Youtubing Sphinx from Malmö: Megic Mike.

10
00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:39.400
Worship from Västerort: Melody Farshin.

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:44.120
The gold boy from Rinkeby who keeps it genuine: Martin Mutumba.

12
00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:49.280
Last but not least, our program manager: Ahmed Berhan!

13
00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:51.640
Welcome to IFS.

14
00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:55.280
The only SVT program with more mythomaniacs than a party leadership debate.

15
00:00:55.440 --> 00:01:01.840
My name is Ahmed Berhan.
 You look at the quiz about all culture in Sweden.

16
00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:10.240
How about applauding today's competitors: Pia, Christer and Frida!

17
00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:19.760
We drew backstage about who would start.
 And Christer won.

18
00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:23.360
- Are you ready to pop that Cherry?
 -Absolutely.

19
00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:28.680
Well then.
 Which of the panelists do you feel you can call in a scam?

20
00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:32.640
Since I have a black -yellow heart, I have to trust one.

21
00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:38.280
Don't start with color so early.
 What the fuck, man!

22
00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:40.480
Mutumba.

23
00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:44.160
You are from Västerort?
 You should know the question.

24
00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:50.040
There is one who is always late.

25
00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:55.400
- For example, melody.
 -You're the one to talk?

26
00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:02.320
-What are you saying?
 Do you trust Martin?
 - Just now I can't do it.

27
00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:08.840
Very well done.
 It is definitely not a person who comes late.

28
00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:17.680
A collective name for people from Eritrea and Ethiopia.

29
00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:21.400
But also people who don't like to arrive on time.

30
00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:26.280
Congratulations, Christer, you got the first point of the evening.

31
00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:34.080
We continue with the next competitor.
 - Frida, who do you want to chew with today?

32
00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:38.200
I probably want to start with Assia.

33
00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:42.400
The subject is close to the heart.
 The word drug ...

34
00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:54.400
It is a Gothenburg word.
 It comes from thicks.

35
00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:58.600
When they get completely cuddled, they get Lockjaws.

36
00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:02.680
The jaws keep on like this, squeeze and drugs.

37
00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:07.480
The word drug comes from there.
 - "Damn, what we crap we are."

38
00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:10.560
I do not know her.

39
00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:15.280
Assia, thank you for your reply.
 - Frida, what do you feel?

40
00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:21.320
Do not know.
 I don't feel ... crack?
 In and of itself ... there is there.

41
00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:26.400
But I don't think it's true.
 It's false.

42
00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:29.600
- It's false?
 -Yes.

43
00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:33.040
You should have trusted Assia, because that's true.

44
00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:35.960
!

45
00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:40.120
I thought drugs were old, but it's hose.

46
00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:46.280
You thought: Gustav in, he and his guys rode there ...

47
00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:51.760
It's true.
 All my friends from Gothenburg are drugs.

48
00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:55.960
- In itself, when you say it.
 -That's right.

49
00:03:56.120 --> 00:04:00.240
Frida, there will be no point.
 Better luck next time.

50
00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:05.160
Over to the last participant.
 - Pia, how does it feel?

51
00:04:05.320 --> 00:04:08.520
- Can you pick a point?
 -Hope.

52
00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:12.240
- What of our panelists do you ask?
 - Melody.

53
00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:15.440
--Shoo.
 -Shoo!

54
00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:19.680
Street cred.
 What happens?

55
00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:27.120
- She was prepared.
 - Pia is the cool teacher.

56
00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:30.680
- We will be bonding in the kiosk later.
 -Absolutely.

57
00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:36.160
Melody, you like to cook.
 You're good at that too.

58
00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:45.800
There are different things Suedis have at home to feel multi-cult.

59
00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:53.040
Nah.
 What is common is that these are spicy products.

60
00:04:53.200 --> 00:04:58.520
But the National Food Agency has required an adaptation to Swedish taste buds -

61
00:04:58.680 --> 00:05:00.720
–And babies.

62
00:05:00.880 --> 00:05:05.680
If you really want to offend a black skull, invite an indian -

63
00:05:05.840 --> 00:05:10.400
- On chaite, naan bread and curry spice on the side.

64
00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:15.800
Melody, you are so damn right.
 It's true.

65
00:05:15.960 --> 00:05:19.680
- Pia!
 - Forgiveness, I took your role.

66
00:05:19.840 --> 00:05:25.160
Sorry, I took your role.
 That was not the point.

67
00:05:26.360 --> 00:05:29.600
Sorry, did you want to say something?

68
00:05:36.320 --> 00:05:38.600
Old school there.

69
00:05:38.760 --> 00:05:43.080
I like that you wirely with melody and want to get a good foot with her.

70
00:05:43.240 --> 00:05:46.160
But her answer was false.

71
00:05:46.320 --> 00:05:49.880
-No!
 –The correct answer is:

72
00:05:50.040 --> 00:05:53.840
All are double words.
 Both parts of the word mean the same thing.

73
00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:59.840
Chai means tea, salsa sauce and curry spice mix.

74
00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:03.280
-You are welcome.
 -Yes!

75
00:06:05.080 --> 00:06:09.320
Christer, you started strongly and are the only one with points.

76
00:06:09.480 --> 00:06:15.080
We see if you can increase your lead.
 Who do you want to chew with?

77
00:06:15.240 --> 00:06:18.480
–Alaf.
 –Yes.

78
00:06:23.920 --> 00:06:31.320
Something you say when you are tired of someone or want it to shut up.

79
00:06:31.480 --> 00:06:35.520
We often say it to each other in my family.

80
00:06:35.680 --> 00:06:39.440
Verbatim it means "eat poop".

81
00:06:43.080 --> 00:06:48.400
- What do you say, Christer?
 - It sounds aggressive.
 I think so.

82
00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:00.040
Do you think I sound aggressive?

83
00:07:00.200 --> 00:07:04.280
Just right.
 It literally means "eat poop".

84
00:07:05.560 --> 00:07:11.840
Elaf, does your family tell it to each other or just to you?

85
00:07:13.880 --> 00:07:19.400
- We say it to each other.
 - They haven't said it often enough.

86
00:07:19.560 --> 00:07:24.200
She just told me it out.

87
00:07:24.360 --> 00:07:27.360
Excuse.
 His interpreter is coming soon.

88
00:07:27.520 --> 00:07:31.840
This is IFS, not SFI, Mike.

89
00:07:34.360 --> 00:07:38.760
- Frida, ready to get a point?
 -I can try.

90
00:07:38.920 --> 00:07:43.880
The only thing you can do.
 Who do you want to chew with?

91
00:07:44.040 --> 00:07:47.280
–Evelyn.
 -Hello Hello.

92
00:07:52.680 --> 00:07:55.520
-Skåne.
 -No!

93
00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:03.760
No, but it used to be Spain.

94
00:08:03.920 --> 00:08:08.680
Thailand is now the country where the most Swedes live.

95
00:08:08.840 --> 00:08:15.040
It has been about 100,000. Everyone is the ones I met on Tinder.

96
00:08:15.960 --> 00:08:19.880
Apparently, they could afford to go to thailand.

97
00:08:20.040 --> 00:08:24.040
Do you think Evelyn tells the truth?
 True or false?

98
00:08:24.200 --> 00:08:26.200
False.

99
00:08:26.360 --> 00:08:31.280
Very good job, Frida.
 You've received your first point.

100
00:08:34.400 --> 00:08:37.280
Welcome into the match.

101
00:08:37.440 --> 00:08:42.320
The real answer is the United States where there are about 150,000.

102
00:08:42.480 --> 00:08:46.600
Then comes Norway, Spain and the UK at 90,000.

103
00:08:46.760 --> 00:08:52.400
In Thailand, only 20,000 live and everyone has mastered at Evelyn.

104
00:08:52.560 --> 00:08:56.920
- CHRISTERS HAS POINTS, Frida has points.
 -My turn.

105
00:08:57.080 --> 00:09:01.760
- Now we take it.
 Who are you talking to?
 - I want to talk to Victor.

106
00:09:01.920 --> 00:09:04.080
The art student.

107
00:09:10.640 --> 00:09:14.040
You have smoked grass with all three, huh?

108
00:09:14.200 --> 00:09:20.040
Nah.
 All three have shares in the Swedish weapons industry.

109
00:09:22.480 --> 00:09:27.840
It does not surprise me, but I think they have been in prison.

110
00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:31.800
A racist hop there.

111
00:09:33.120 --> 00:09:37.720
- Pia is a gangster, the man.
 - Forgive again.

112
00:09:37.880 --> 00:09:42.200
Not really.
 You got a point.
 Congratulations!

113
00:09:47.280 --> 00:09:51.240
Everyone has been detained when they were in Sweden.

114
00:09:51.400 --> 00:09:56.520
- Cheritr, who do you want to talk to?
 -Thanos.

115
00:10:00.160 --> 00:10:06.600
Bazz is English, buzz me.
 Then it became Bazz, which means letting me in.

116
00:10:06.760 --> 00:10:11.240
Suburban guys denied the pub can say to the guard:

117
00:10:11.400 --> 00:10:15.200
"You bazz the svens here, but you don't bazz us."

118
00:10:17.800 --> 00:10:21.920
A girl has dated a guy and he doesn't let her in:

119
00:10:22.080 --> 00:10:27.320
"What about your guys? You bazz them, but not me."

120
00:10:28.800 --> 00:10:32.360
Does the guards usually bazz you?

121
00:10:33.360 --> 00:10:35.680
Christer?

122
00:10:37.280 --> 00:10:38.960
In other words...

123
00:10:39.120 --> 00:10:45.000
- You have incorrect information now.
 -Okay.
 It took.
 It felt.

124
00:10:45.160 --> 00:10:49.280
-I apologize.
 - Zucchiniturken is lying?

125
00:10:49.440 --> 00:10:52.880
You did absolutely right.
 It was false.

126
00:10:57.360 --> 00:11:03.000
- Should we tell us what Bazz means?
 - Frida was there and said, "I know."

127
00:11:03.160 --> 00:11:07.920
You were on zucchini.
 So Bazz is to lie with someone.

128
00:11:08.080 --> 00:11:11.480
-It is right.
 -Point!

129
00:11:11.640 --> 00:11:16.560
No, wait, wait!
 You just connect it with zucchini.

130
00:11:16.720 --> 00:11:21.280
It is another program on another channel.

131
00:11:22.720 --> 00:11:24.720
Christer, great work.

132
00:11:24.880 --> 00:11:29.200
- Frida, do you want one more point?
 -I can try.

133
00:11:29.360 --> 00:11:34.200
-Believe in yourself.
 Who can you read?
 - Filip.

134
00:11:34.360 --> 00:11:38.720
- Oh, damn!
 - We had eye contact there.

135
00:11:38.880 --> 00:11:43.120
I was hoping for Pia.
 She is a gangster, but we drive on Frida.

136
00:11:43.280 --> 00:11:48.480
- Pia is a real brother, a soldier.
 -Wait!
 Can you regret it?

137
00:11:48.640 --> 00:11:51.480
I love Pia.
 - Filip!

138
00:11:54.640 --> 00:11:59.280
A street war between hairdressers and wedding fixers.

139
00:11:59.440 --> 00:12:04.400
No.
 Södertalje requirements were a major fight in the 70s-

140
00:12:04.560 --> 00:12:10.600
- Between 30 Assyrians and 200 raggers.
 "Sweden's first ravage crawler".

141
00:12:10.760 --> 00:12:15.800
What did they argue about?
 Who hated blacks most?

142
00:12:22.760 --> 00:12:27.240
Assia, that's what united them.

143
00:12:27.840 --> 00:12:31.680
"I'm white! - No, I'm white!"

144
00:12:33.240 --> 00:12:38.920
Frida, is the Södertalje requirements what Filip said?
 True or false?

145
00:12:39.080 --> 00:12:44.520
I don't know if there are 200 raggers in Södertälje.
 It doesn't feel that way.

146
00:12:44.680 --> 00:12:48.440
-This is 70s.
 - Before the others came.

147
00:12:48.600 --> 00:12:53.880
- False.
 - Can't you do your Swedish history?

148
00:12:54.040 --> 00:12:58.560
Obviously not.
 What he said was true.

149
00:12:59.240 --> 00:13:01.440
It was so.

150
00:13:05.400 --> 00:13:10.760
This is the only program where we applaud racial riots.

151
00:13:10.920 --> 00:13:13.960
You, Pia, now we drive.

152
00:13:14.120 --> 00:13:19.920
- Do you also want to test Filip?
 No ... - He is used, I was saying.

153
00:13:27.400 --> 00:13:30.920
-Ouch.
 - Use me as much as you want.

154
00:13:31.080 --> 00:13:35.640
Pia just: "No Sloppy Seconds for me."

155
00:13:35.800 --> 00:13:39.240
- I want to talk to Ato.
 - Hi, Pia!

156
00:13:39.400 --> 00:13:42.480
Hola, Hola!

157
00:13:43.680 --> 00:13:48.160
Racism just goes on.
 - Thanks, Pia.
 I thought we clicked.

158
00:13:48.320 --> 00:13:52.440
- She thinks you're chile.
 - What are you for something?

159
00:13:52.600 --> 00:13:56.600
The Champ, I'm going to ask you a question.

160
00:13:56.760 --> 00:14:01.880
- What is the question, Ahmed?
 - She made you Chilean.

161
00:14:02.920 --> 00:14:07.920
- Hola, Cómo Está?
 - She thought his name is Watto.

162
00:14:08.080 --> 00:14:12.280
ATO can go to Hollywood and play 13 breeds.

163
00:14:12.440 --> 00:14:18.120
-Alla's job, brother.
 —Racially ambiguous.
 Ato ...

164
00:14:23.840 --> 00:14:30.600
That you are a bell.
 Snitches get bitches.
 I think so.

165
00:14:30.760 --> 00:14:34.880
- brother, which place are you from?
 - Blue the line, brother.

166
00:14:35.040 --> 00:14:40.400
Can we change places on Pia and him?
 And have Pia there instead.

167
00:14:40.560 --> 00:14:45.280
-I did not hear.
 I'm a little deaf.
 - Nitches get bitches.

168
00:14:45.440 --> 00:14:48.040
I heard you.

169
00:14:50.720 --> 00:14:56.360
--We or white?
 -White.
 What is to have a white tongue?

170
00:14:56.520 --> 00:15:03.120
It is a discreet way of saying that you have bad breath.

171
00:15:03.280 --> 00:15:08.920
- Did you hear that, Pia?
 - I just have to take it in and ...

172
00:15:09.080 --> 00:15:14.160
Since they laugh so much, it must be false.

173
00:15:14.320 --> 00:15:17.680
- Pia thinks you are lying.
 - The teachers have never liked me.

174
00:15:17.840 --> 00:15:20.320
Pia is absolutely right.

175
00:15:22.680 --> 00:15:24.720
Thanks.

176
00:15:24.880 --> 00:15:27.840
Thanks for the help.

177
00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:33.520
I swear to my mom, Pia is a brother.
 - Can you become my grandmother?

178
00:15:33.680 --> 00:15:37.120
No no!
 I can become your girlfriend.

179
00:15:39.640 --> 00:15:42.800
/Bus whistles and applause/

180
00:15:47.040 --> 00:15:48.800
Megic!

181
00:15:48.960 --> 00:15:54.680
That's really good.
 Finally you can get a residence permit.

182
00:15:57.240 --> 00:16:00.520
Time for the last question in the round.

183
00:16:00.680 --> 00:16:05.720
Christer, your turn.
 Let's see if you are a hundred bump and get everyone right.

184
00:16:05.880 --> 00:16:10.320
- I try.
 - He is good, that Christer.

185
00:16:10.480 --> 00:16:14.800
- Mike.
 - Day for an image question.

186
00:16:22.120 --> 00:16:24.600
/GIGGLING/

187
00:16:24.760 --> 00:16:30.360
Countries where Russia will open their anal.

188
00:16:30.520 --> 00:16:33.040
- Open what?
 - Arens anal.

189
00:16:33.200 --> 00:16:36.160
-Invade.
 -Okay.

190
00:16:36.320 --> 00:16:39.680
Can't you Swedish, right?

191
00:16:46.360 --> 00:16:50.520
The blue countries, that part of Europe-

192
00:16:50.680 --> 00:16:54.760
- Are the countries that invite people to food at home.

193
00:16:54.920 --> 00:16:57.280
And the red ...

194
00:16:59.600 --> 00:17:05.080
I am not invited.
 You are not sure to be invited.

195
00:17:05.240 --> 00:17:10.000
Do you think Megic Mike's response is true or false?

196
00:17:10.160 --> 00:17:13.960
- I don't believe in Mike.
 - It's false?

197
00:17:14.120 --> 00:17:20.000
I said from the beginning that he does not believe in Swedes, not in immigrants!

198
00:17:20.160 --> 00:17:23.760
You could get a full pot.
 It is right.

199
00:17:23.920 --> 00:17:28.800
Memen went viral this spring during "Sweden Gate" on social media.

200
00:17:28.960 --> 00:17:33.640
The red colors were countries where you are not offered food, and the blue ...

201
00:17:33.800 --> 00:17:39.840
Wait!
 My sister took the student today.
 Mom has invited all of Ystad to food.

202
00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:44.560
- I swear, she has invited the whole of Ystad.
 - You got your answer.

203
00:17:44.720 --> 00:17:49.440
It rounds off the first round, my ladies and gentlemen.

204
00:17:52.080 --> 00:17:56.840
Awesome work, all competitors.
 Unfortunately, one was less amazing.

205
00:17:57.000 --> 00:18:02.040
Frida, good job, but time for you to tag home.

206
00:18:03.600 --> 00:18:10.000
Our two winners who go to the final round are Pia and Christer!

207
00:18:18.040 --> 00:18:23.040
Pia, Christer ... In the final you should come first to five.

208
00:18:23.200 --> 00:18:30.240
But there is a twist.
 If you answer wrong, the score goes to the opponent.

209
00:18:30.400 --> 00:18:34.440
Pia, how about you start the round?

210
00:18:34.600 --> 00:18:40.000
I can try.
 I do as if I drive on Filip.

211
00:18:40.160 --> 00:18:43.320
Tell them, Pia, "My Brother".

212
00:18:44.120 --> 00:18:46.480
Hey!

213
00:18:49.000 --> 00:18:54.040
Filip?
 Can you explain to the room and the Swedish people:

214
00:18:58.600 --> 00:19:04.120
Qhap is a hose for a type of salesman.

215
00:19:05.400 --> 00:19:08.880
Very driven person, ambitious.

216
00:19:09.040 --> 00:19:15.440
I would say that the equivalent in Swedish is an entrepreneur.

217
00:19:15.600 --> 00:19:17.800
A man with entrepreneurial spirit.

218
00:19:17.960 --> 00:19:24.000
A good example of a Qhap is Thanos.
 Great Qhap.
 Superpopular.

219
00:19:24.160 --> 00:19:27.280
Ten out of ten.

220
00:19:29.560 --> 00:19:33.960
Thank you for the explanation.
 - Pia, what do you say?

221
00:19:34.120 --> 00:19:38.040
-True or false.
 - Filip, why are you lying to me?

222
00:19:39.160 --> 00:19:45.640
- You took badly.
 I feel shame.
 - Don't make so against the elderly.

223
00:19:45.800 --> 00:19:50.960
- I think it's false.
 -Just right.
 You were doing right.

224
00:19:57.800 --> 00:20:03.200
Nice.
 I skip the true answer.
 Those who google can google.

225
00:20:03.360 --> 00:20:07.920
- CHRISTERS, YOUR TURN.
 –Alaf.

226
00:20:08.080 --> 00:20:10.520
Elaf ...

227
00:20:11.840 --> 00:20:16.160
- Are you Elaf or Enough?
 - Let he say wrong!

228
00:20:16.320 --> 00:20:22.160
- People usually say Enough to Elaf.
 - LOVE.
 Elaf Love.

229
00:20:29.920 --> 00:20:34.280
Because the film contains many black characters -

230
00:20:34.440 --> 00:20:36.880
- And takes place in the hood.

231
00:20:37.040 --> 00:20:42.560
SF thought it would attract many with immigrant backgrounds, noise.

232
00:20:42.720 --> 00:20:46.600
They became worried and took in guardians.

233
00:20:46.760 --> 00:20:49.960
Why does no one laugh?
 /LAUGH/

234
00:20:52.360 --> 00:20:55.760
- Chrier?
 - Tragically, it's certainly true.

235
00:20:56.960 --> 00:21:00.240
Yes, you are absolutely right.

236
00:21:02.680 --> 00:21:08.200
True.
 Their motivation was that the hip hop film attracts a certain audience -

237
00:21:08.360 --> 00:21:11.680
- Which is not so used to going to the cinema.

238
00:21:11.840 --> 00:21:16.760
Therefore, kids, you always download film.

239
00:21:19.640 --> 00:21:21.800
Pirate Rise.

240
00:21:21.960 --> 00:21:24.760
1–1.
 Very good job by you.

241
00:21:24.920 --> 00:21:28.640
- Pia, are you ready to take it further?
 - Yeah.

242
00:21:28.800 --> 00:21:31.800
We drive at Assia.

243
00:21:31.960 --> 00:21:35.120
Deli is an abbreviation for delicacy.

244
00:21:40.640 --> 00:21:47.160
Etymology comes from when Italians immigrant to Sweden.

245
00:21:47.320 --> 00:21:52.360
They worked in "bad jobs", many felt.

246
00:21:52.520 --> 00:21:58.240
A racist gallop.
 They were called "fucking deli" and "chark".

247
00:22:00.960 --> 00:22:07.040
It's true.
 Have you never heard "Fucking Salami Slingers"?

248
00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:11.160
-Some ...-if you should say the D-word ...

249
00:22:11.320 --> 00:22:16.680
... you have to censor it.
 –D, e ... hm ... i.

250
00:22:16.840 --> 00:22:22.400
- Does she mean Negroes?
 - I don't think so, but fuck it.

251
00:22:22.560 --> 00:22:27.000
- Mike, no!
 -Mike, you're on time-out now.

252
00:22:27.160 --> 00:22:32.120
That's why your mom didn't invite you to your sister's student.

253
00:22:34.560 --> 00:22:39.240
Mike also works as a security guard at cinema in Malmö.

254
00:22:39.400 --> 00:22:44.280
We will return to you, Pia.
 Do you think Assia's response is true or false?

255
00:22:44.440 --> 00:22:48.840
- I think it's false.
 - I think you are false.

256
00:22:49.000 --> 00:22:52.560
- Hey!
 - You think it's false?

257
00:22:52.720 --> 00:22:57.240
You are doing absolutely right.
 You've got one more point.
 Congratulations, Pia.

258
00:23:00.720 --> 00:23:05.600
Deli is a hose for someone who is stupid, stupid.

259
00:23:05.760 --> 00:23:08.160
Cruelly.
 It now says 2-1.

260
00:23:08.320 --> 00:23:13.680
- CHRISTMAS, ready?
 Who do you want to take?
 - Melody.

261
00:23:13.840 --> 00:23:17.080
- Salaam Alaikum.
 - Aalaic Salaam.

262
00:23:17.240 --> 00:23:20.440
Yes, yes, yes!

263
00:23:20.600 --> 00:23:25.400
It has been my dream to say Salaam Alaikum in SVT.

264
00:23:25.560 --> 00:23:30.880
Melody, when we are still on linguistic courses from other countries.

265
00:23:36.960 --> 00:23:43.240
You invite someone to a juicy dinner and ask them to swish for it.

266
00:23:46.000 --> 00:23:50.520
No.
 Making a Swedish is this situation -

267
00:23:50.680 --> 00:23:56.280
- When two ethnic Swedes try to duck each other, but happen to meet -

268
00:23:56.440 --> 00:24:00.560
- Get eye contact: "Fuck, I don't want to see the person!"

269
00:24:00.720 --> 00:24:08.160
They panic and make this snuff greeting "Hello" reluctantly.

270
00:24:08.320 --> 00:24:13.400
- It's the scenario.
 - What did you say it was called?

271
00:24:13.560 --> 00:24:16.680
Hacerse El Sueco.
 To make themselves Swedish.

272
00:24:16.840 --> 00:24:23.400
- Can you say it again?
 -You are on time-out.

273
00:24:23.560 --> 00:24:27.520
I have to start trusting people, so I trust Melody.

274
00:24:28.160 --> 00:24:31.320
You did completely wrong.

275
00:24:31.480 --> 00:24:37.120
The true answer to Hacerse El Sueco is playing stupid.

276
00:24:37.280 --> 00:24:40.160
You pretend it is raining.

277
00:24:40.320 --> 00:24:45.720
What is the fucking back story for that?
 Are Swedes notorious to be stupid?

278
00:24:45.880 --> 00:24:49.120
No no.
 They play stupid.

279
00:24:50.040 --> 00:24:54.400
Sweden has been war before.
 They have played neutral.

280
00:24:54.560 --> 00:24:58.400
- Thanks for the homework.
 - Yeah.

281
00:24:58.560 --> 00:25:03.360
Because you were wrong, Pia got one more point.

282
00:25:03.520 --> 00:25:06.920
Pia, see if you can pick one.

283
00:25:07.080 --> 00:25:12.400
I would like to talk this time with Martin.

284
00:25:12.560 --> 00:25:14.280
Martin ...

285
00:25:18.800 --> 00:25:22.280
They wanted our blondes.

286
00:25:22.440 --> 00:25:28.640
They were good at iron handling.
 The king and nobility milked them on the kids.

287
00:25:30.520 --> 00:25:35.560
-It's true.
 - Pia, the history teacher.

288
00:25:35.720 --> 00:25:39.480
- Good, Pia.
 -In the 17th century, she was there.

289
00:25:45.240 --> 00:25:49.840
Completely correct.
 They came here in the 17th century to work with iron.

290
00:25:50.000 --> 00:25:54.280
They were incredible blacksmiths.
 - Christer, your turn now.

291
00:25:54.440 --> 00:26:00.880
But according to our beautiful score board, it is not in your favor.

292
00:26:01.040 --> 00:26:05.440
Even worse, if you answer wrong - what happens then?

293
00:26:05.600 --> 00:26:09.120
-Its over.
 - Then Pia wins.

294
00:26:09.280 --> 00:26:12.760
Try not to pamper your family.

295
00:26:12.920 --> 00:26:16.480
Who are you betting your card on?

296
00:26:16.640 --> 00:26:20.440
–Evelyn.
 - Hi, Christer!

297
00:26:31.720 --> 00:26:40.080
Environmentalist Ali Khalil wanted to become an ambassador to the Emirate Dubai.

298
00:26:42.600 --> 00:26:45.560
- Chrier?
 - Yes, but ...

299
00:26:45.720 --> 00:26:48.960
Yes it's true.

300
00:26:49.120 --> 00:26:52.080
Unfortunately, Christer.
 The answer is false.

301
00:26:52.240 --> 00:26:56.600
Ali Khalil wanted to get building permits to build a mosque.

302
00:26:56.760 --> 00:27:03.440
You have not only lost the point, but Pia has won the entire competition!

303
00:27:09.760 --> 00:27:14.120
Pia, came here.
 - More applause for Pia!

304
00:27:15.520 --> 00:27:20.000
Congratulations, Pia!
 Awesome work.
 Here you get a diploma.

305
00:27:20.160 --> 00:27:23.000
- Lite flowers.
 -Thank you.

306
00:27:23.160 --> 00:27:27.760
Thanks to the audience, our incredible competitors -

307
00:27:27.920 --> 00:27:32.320
- Our fantastic panel and everyone who looked at home.

308
00:27:32.480 --> 00:27:35.480
See you again next week.
 Feel the best.

309
00:27:48.120 --> 00:27:51.200
