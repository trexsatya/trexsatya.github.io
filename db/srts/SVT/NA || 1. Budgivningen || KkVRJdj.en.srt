1
00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:10.680
Norrland - a beautiful landscape with high mountains.

2
00:00:10.840 --> 00:00:17.760
Miles -long primeval forest and a population living in harmony with nature.

3
00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:24.000
But for the brothers Öhman in Sörbäcken, everyday life is not harmonious.

4
00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:44.560
C.Teletext.urfjarranleif!

5
00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:49.120
Yes, it's Leif.

6
00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:54.960
It seems to be dead.
 There will be no protein today either.

7
00:00:55.120 --> 00:00:58.560
I'm starting to move home.

8
00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:05.320
Damn!

9
00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:14.640
See if you find lingonberries or mushrooms or any fuck.

10
00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:22.840
- Yes, but Leif ... - it doesn't matter!

11
00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:26.760
I might as well die anyway.

12
00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:29.880
Hello!

13
00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:36.680
Cursed boot fucking!

14
00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:41.800
It is better than the safe.

15
00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:53.200
Not a bastard finds this.

16
00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:43.880
Damn!

17
00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:56.520
Check out what I found, Leif!

18
00:02:58.520 --> 00:03:06.280
I might not have done it!
 The ragging gang came with the bag.

19
00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:11.000
- The thunk?
 - No, he sits inside.

20
00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:15.280
It was Jimmy with the knife's cousin, Damp-Janne.

21
00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:20.160
-Oh my God!
 Did he see you?
 -I do not think so.

22
00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:27.600
Hell!
 Damn!
 What have I done?

23
00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:38.200
What in the whole ...?

24
00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:43.960
Pull me backwards through the gates of hell, Billy.

25
00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:48.320
Oh my God!

26
00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:53.920
I can't turn from Damp-Janne.

27
00:03:54.080 --> 00:04:00.200
Billy, don't you understand?
 We have lived in this caravan for almost a year.

28
00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:06.840
I shit in whose money it is.
 This is a gift from above.

29
00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:14.200
Now we have the chance, Billy, to start a new life.

30
00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:23.720
There is only one house for sale.
 Sörbäcken is our home.

31
00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:29.920
Starting price 200,000?
 We have 700,000 in the bag.

32
00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:35.680
Take it easy.
 Do not go around with gold fever in the skull.

33
00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:39.720
Now you have to push down the price first.

34
00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:44.600
Calm down!

35
00:05:03.040 --> 00:05:07.120
- Here it is, Billy.
 - The dream house!

36
00:05:07.280 --> 00:05:12.440
It is newly renovated.
 We can shoot pigs from the upstairs.

37
00:05:12.600 --> 00:05:17.920
- Think, soon it's ours.
 - It is long.

38
00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:21.680
We need to remove other speculators.

39
00:05:21.840 --> 00:05:25.760
-How?
 -I have a plan.

40
00:05:33.960 --> 00:05:37.480
Hello Hello!
 Welcome.

41
00:05:37.640 --> 00:05:42.640
Here you go.
 There are prospectus on the table.

42
00:05:42.800 --> 00:05:46.000
Hello.
 - Hello.

43
00:05:46.160 --> 00:05:51.920
It's such a nice light input!
 When we renovate it becomes perfect.

44
00:05:56.120 --> 00:06:00.200
Well, so that's where they hung.

45
00:06:03.560 --> 00:06:08.600
The family who lived here before, everyone hung.

46
00:06:08.760 --> 00:06:12.160
But they have well taken down the hooks.

47
00:06:12.320 --> 00:06:16.160
No, corner, we pull.

48
00:06:20.080 --> 00:06:23.680
This could be our bedroom.

49
00:06:28.400 --> 00:06:31.360
Oh oh oh...

50
00:06:31.520 --> 00:06:37.000
I am from the radiation authority and measure the radiation.

51
00:06:37.160 --> 00:06:44.040
Fy hell.
 - I get full ruling on the radar, so I move outward -

52
00:06:44.200 --> 00:06:49.360
- Whatever I get miscarriage, no, malformations.

53
00:06:51.800 --> 00:06:55.600
A cozy kitchen.
 What do you think, the old man?

54
00:06:55.760 --> 00:06:58.480
God!

55
00:06:58.640 --> 00:07:02.360
Well ... Greger has already found here.

56
00:07:02.520 --> 00:07:07.240
Dirty-Gger, as he is called.
 He lives close.

57
00:07:07.400 --> 00:07:13.080
A rough sex offender, or pedophile - I mix it together.

58
00:07:13.240 --> 00:07:18.880
Tjena, Greger!
 - He smells of new people.

59
00:07:19.040 --> 00:07:24.760
Oh my God!
 Come kids, we've been looking clearly.

60
00:07:29.960 --> 00:07:37.400
Fy fuck, Leif, you are a genius.
 Not a bastard is interested.

61
00:07:37.560 --> 00:07:43.120
Take it easy.
 It's long before this is done.

62
00:07:49.680 --> 00:07:55.280
- Were you doing?
 -I beg.

63
00:07:55.440 --> 00:08:02.040
Haven't you heard of praying?
 Then you get what you want.
 Quiet now.

64
00:08:03.040 --> 00:08:10.160
Why haven't you said it before?
 Then we will see what Leif Öhman wants.

65
00:08:10.320 --> 00:08:16.600
I want a castle by a lake, seven wives in bikini running around -

66
00:08:16.760 --> 00:08:23.200
- And dolphins that spray money out of their heads.
 - It's not a wish game!

67
00:08:23.360 --> 00:08:26.680
Pea brain - this is reality.

68
00:08:26.840 --> 00:08:31.840
People become like Hyenor when bidding is left.

69
00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:39.680
I don't know what I do if we don't get the house.
 Not another day here!

70
00:08:39.840 --> 00:08:45.600
- It certainly goes well.
 -We'll see.
 That's our only chance.

71
00:08:47.640 --> 00:08:51.560
Now fate may decide our future.

72
00:08:56.880 --> 00:09:01.080
I'll be coming soon.

73
00:09:01.240 --> 00:09:04.440
Soon the biding begins.

74
00:09:04.600 --> 00:09:08.600
C.Teletext. sound signc. sound

75
00:09:19.720 --> 00:09:26.000
- God, what you are scared!
 -Sorry.
 That was not the point.

76
00:09:26.160 --> 00:09:33.800
I was going to ask if any people are interested in the kitchen.

77
00:09:33.960 --> 00:09:41.760
No not yet.
 It's a bit strange.
 200,000 for this is not so stupid.

78
00:09:41.920 --> 00:09:44.840
No, that's fine.

79
00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:51.040
We will see now that the bidding starts.

80
00:09:54.080 --> 00:10:00.160
I'll put the cards on the table for you.

81
00:10:00.320 --> 00:10:04.000
My brother is completely ruined.

82
00:10:04.160 --> 00:10:10.000
We have lived in a caravan for almost a year.
 It is pretty hard.

83
00:10:10.160 --> 00:10:17.080
Sörbäcken is our home, so it is important for us that we get the house.

84
00:10:17.240 --> 00:10:23.480
But if you are interested, you should place a bid.

85
00:10:23.640 --> 00:10:30.000
-Yes Yes.
 Yes, or maybe.
 - It is clear that you are going!

86
00:10:30.160 --> 00:10:35.880
- Yes, then we do.
 - How much do you want to put?

87
00:10:36.040 --> 00:10:41.400
Let's say three or two hundred ... a thousand.

88
00:10:41.560 --> 00:10:45.400
Perhaps.
 If it's possible.

89
00:10:45.560 --> 00:10:50.040
Yes, it goes.
 I will call.

90
00:10:50.200 --> 00:10:56.120
Hi Andreas.
 I stand away at Sörbäcken and we have a first bid.

91
00:10:56.280 --> 00:10:59.800
Yes exactly.
 Starting price.

92
00:10:59.960 --> 00:11:05.680
Your name?
 You don't have to say your real name, you can take an alias.

93
00:11:05.840 --> 00:11:09.520
Well.
 Type ...

94
00:11:09.680 --> 00:11:14.120
Should you take Pelle Paltnacke?

95
00:11:14.280 --> 00:11:17.080
Pelle Paltnacke.

96
00:11:17.240 --> 00:11:20.760
Pelle Paltnacke.
 Good!

97
00:11:25.600 --> 00:11:29.200
Okay, now we're up and running.

98
00:11:30.640 --> 00:11:37.160
Pelle Paltnacke ... okay, then we'll see what you are going for.

99
00:11:37.320 --> 00:11:43.880
Username: Mister Handsome 3000.

100
00:11:45.280 --> 00:11:49.280
Well, then we say so.
 Good!

101
00:11:50.680 --> 00:11:55.080
Huh?
 Mister Handsome 3000?

102
00:11:55.240 --> 00:12:01.640
Ahm ... Now there has been a counter -bid of SEK 250,000.

103
00:12:01.800 --> 00:12:08.720
-Oh!
 Well.
 It was ... damn.
 - You can think and wait a bit.

104
00:12:08.880 --> 00:12:16.800
No, dammit.
 We must have the kitchen.
 Raise.
 Toss 50,000 more.

105
00:12:21.200 --> 00:12:28.160
Okay.
 You wanna play tough, man, you wanna fuck with mr cool?

106
00:12:28.320 --> 00:12:31.400
You Wanna Play Hard?

107
00:12:31.560 --> 00:12:37.760
Leif, tough to you.
 No fucking meseri.
 Now it will be shock rise.

108
00:12:39.400 --> 00:12:42.960
So, Pelle Paltnacke.
 What do you say now?

109
00:12:43.120 --> 00:12:48.680
-What are they saying?
 - They shocked with 100,000.

110
00:12:48.840 --> 00:12:51.800
Hell!

111
00:12:51.960 --> 00:12:57.440
Shut up, love, and let me think!
 Sorry...

112
00:12:57.600 --> 00:13:00.760
Shock height back.
 100,000 more.

113
00:13:04.600 --> 00:13:06.840
No!

114
00:13:10.640 --> 00:13:14.440
Satan!
 Okay, Leif, calm, calm.

115
00:13:14.600 --> 00:13:20.240
Now you have to think tactically.
 This is all you have.

116
00:13:20.400 --> 00:13:26.160
Come on now, God, Buddah, Allah or what you are called.
 Help me now.

117
00:13:30.760 --> 00:13:33.880
SEK 700,000.

118
00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:39.560
Yes, okay.
 Wait.

119
00:13:41.880 --> 00:13:45.520
SEK 700,000.

120
00:13:48.800 --> 00:13:52.520
What do you feel - do you want to raise, right?

121
00:13:52.680 --> 00:13:57.520
No, I have no more money now.

122
00:13:58.600 --> 00:14:03.480
-No.
 - I thank me for me.

123
00:14:07.200 --> 00:14:11.800
Hello!
 Thus, 700,000 ...

124
00:14:21.520 --> 00:14:26.360
Leif, I have some bad news.

125
00:14:26.520 --> 00:14:29.360
Worse than we are panca?

126
00:14:29.520 --> 00:14:34.440
I have bid against Pelle Paltnacke.
 He was hard as Satan-

127
00:14:34.600 --> 00:14:39.480
- But then I stepped in with 700,000. Then he gave up.

128
00:14:39.640 --> 00:14:45.680
The house is ours, the brother.
 What kind of bad news did you have?

129
00:14:45.840 --> 00:14:53.000
It was nothing special.
 I was out pissing and saw that the car ...

130
00:14:53.160 --> 00:14:59.480
Shit in the car!
 We have our own house.
 Yours and mine, the brother!

131
00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:04.520
- Are you not happy?
 -Yes.

132
00:15:04.680 --> 00:15:07.960
Good!
 Then we move in.

133
00:15:12.040 --> 00:15:14.000
Okay...

134
00:15:17.960 --> 00:15:21.960
I'll find out who Pelle Paltnacke is.

135
00:15:22.120 --> 00:15:25.080
Shit in it, we have the house.

136
00:15:26.800 --> 00:15:33.400
Is there anyone who bought that jerk?
 What a fucking nuts.

137
00:15:37.280 --> 00:15:40.080
