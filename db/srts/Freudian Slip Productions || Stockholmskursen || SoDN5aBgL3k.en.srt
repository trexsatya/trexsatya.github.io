00:00:01,220 --> 00:00:04,880
Every year, twenty thousand people move to Stockholm

2
00:00:04,940 --> 00:00:07,760
Many of them can feel that it's difficult fitting in

3
00:00:07,960 --> 00:00:11,620
That is why we have created The Stockholm Course

4
00:00:12,040 --> 00:00:15,900
Hi, I'm gonna be your teacher for this course. Im gonna teach you how to fit in.

5
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:18,920
We teach you to alter your behaviour with different exercises

6
00:00:18,920 --> 00:00:19,700
What you do you for a living?

7
00:00:19,700 --> 00:00:24,440
Stop! Why are you turning the attention away from yourself?

8
00:00:24,580 --> 00:00:25,120
Because it's pleasant?

9
00:00:25,300 --> 00:00:25,800
Sit down!

10
00:00:25,980 --> 00:00:27,980
And teach you how to communicate correctly

11
00:00:27,980 --> 00:00:31,380
You are either from south of Stockholm or from north of Stockholm

12
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:33,700
You will also get to learn how to talk in the Stockholm accent

13
00:00:33,700 --> 00:00:36,480
For example, "Excuse me, could you please move? is "Move!"

14
00:00:36,740 --> 00:00:39,260
How do you translate "I was wrong"?

15
00:00:41,420 --> 00:00:42,400
What does that mean?

16
00:00:42,460 --> 00:00:45,960
On our trips you get to learn from real life situations

17
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:50,340
As you can see, it's harder for someone to get through if you're blocking the way

18
00:00:50,420 --> 00:00:52,180
It's easier if we're not standing in the way

19
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:53,700
..yeah kinda

20
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:56,880
So, what do we do when someone is passed out like this?

21
00:00:57,180 --> 00:00:58,960
You ignore it and continue on your way?

22
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:00,600
No, were not heartless.

23
00:01:00,680 --> 00:01:04,560
Obviously we move the person off the bicycle lane so people can get past.

24
00:01:04,600 --> 00:01:06,520
We also have time for questions

25
00:01:06,520 --> 00:01:09,020
Do people from Stockholm think they're better than everyone else?

26
00:01:09,020 --> 00:01:11,640
No, of course not. We know we are.

27
00:01:11,700 --> 00:01:13,400
Isn't that kind of arrogant?

28
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:15,880
Coming from the girl with the ugly shirt.

29
00:01:16,480 --> 00:01:20,320
Apply now and begin your future as a successful Stockholmer

30
00:01:20,520 --> 00:01:23,220
Man, they're so fucking retarded

31
00:01:23,220 --> 00:01:25,960
I cant stand teaching this course anymore

32
00:01:26,940 --> 00:01:29,360
You can go home now,  the time is up.

33
00:01:32,940 --> 00:01:34,940
Shit, its like an herd of sheep.
