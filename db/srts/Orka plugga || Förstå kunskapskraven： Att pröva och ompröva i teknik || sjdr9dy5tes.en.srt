1
00:00:05,840 --> 00:00:08,920
In our time, high demands are placed on technical knowledge.

2
00:00:09,080 --> 00:00:12,280
Technical improvements solve many problems.

3
00:00:12,440 --> 00:00:18,480
In the technology subject you should develop your own technical ideas and solutions.

4
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:23,560
Developing technical solutions requires both creativity and problem solving.

5
00:00:23,720 --> 00:00:28,280
An architect, for example, must first identify and examine the needs-

6
00:00:28,440 --> 00:00:32,560
-And try ideas for solutions with sketches and models.

7
00:00:32,720 --> 00:00:36,400
For example.
 the building may be climate smart and functional.

8
00:00:36,560 --> 00:00:39,400
But it should look good and be economical.

9
00:00:39,560 --> 00:00:45,160
When there is a proposal, a drawing is designed, and the house can be built.

10
00:00:45,320 --> 00:00:50,440
The technology development work in the school is similar to the architect's work.

11
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:54,840
To assess the quality of your work and tell you what you can develop-

12
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:58,360
-Your teacher always starts from the knowledge requirements.

13
00:00:58,520 --> 00:01:02,360
The requirements for technology in grade nine stand:

14
00:01:20,360 --> 00:01:23,480
To systematically try and re-examine ideas act om-

15
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:27,040
-Developing and adapting solutions to different requirements.

16
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:29,720
Here comes an example:

17
00:01:41,240 --> 00:01:44,280
Here is a picture of what the area looks like.

18
00:01:44,440 --> 00:01:50,360
Okay, Attefallshus we have talked about.
 It may be a maximum of 25 square meters.

19
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:55,800
The neighbor's house is quite close, so I put in the middle of the other side.

20
00:01:55,960 --> 00:02:03,320
According to the Swedish National Board of Housing, Building and Planning's site, Attefallshus must be 4.5 m from the site boundary.

21
00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:06,640
There the house ends up well.
 How loud should it be?

22
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:10,480
It may be a maximum of 4 m between ground and roof.

23
00:02:10,640 --> 00:02:13,000
Then it will be tough with two floors-

24
00:02:13,160 --> 00:02:17,680
-But I build a sleeping loft and get more floors to put furniture on.

25
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:21,560
Good!
 With the help of the plot map and the Swedish Housing Agency's website-

26
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:25,240
-You examined the conditions for the assignment.

27
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:30,680
You also weighed the need for space in the form of an extra sleeping loft.

28
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:34,920
The last lesson we looked at hold and stable constructions.

29
00:02:35,080 --> 00:02:38,000
How do you choose in this case?

30
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:42,600
I use the roof chairs to create the sleeping loft.

31
00:02:42,760 --> 00:02:47,160
Yes, they make it stable.
 Do you have any ideas about the foundation?

32
00:02:47,320 --> 00:02:52,480
I cast a concrete slab.
 In it there should be a grid of reinforcing iron.

33
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:56,360
Then I get better tensile strength in the concrete.

34
00:02:56,520 --> 00:02:58,320
Good foundation.

35
00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:03,960
And the concepts of concrete slab, reinforcing iron and tensile strength-

36
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:08,320
-Shi that you use a technical vocabulary.

37
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:13,720
Maybe there are more adjustments that make the house energy efficient?

38
00:03:13,880 --> 00:03:18,040
You should minimize heat loss and maximize gains.

39
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:21,120
For example.
 Should the house not be built in shade.

40
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:23,560
Do you have to rethink something then?

41
00:03:23,720 --> 00:03:29,200
Yes.
 I have to move the house a bit from the spruce forest that shadows.

42
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:34,200
-Anything else?
 -Yes, choose the appropriate insulation in the walls.

43
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:38,880
By lifting in energy-efficient solutions you got new ideas-

44
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:41,400
-When you show the sketch.

45
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:44,960
Some work remains before you can do drawings.

46
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:49,320
For example.
 Must all dimensions match and be scaled.

47
00:03:49,480 --> 00:03:51,800
But now we leave the example.

48
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:56,000
Technology development work in the school can be divided into different phases.

49
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:11,680
In the example, the need was first clarified: to build an Attefallshus.

50
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:14,680
The need was then examined on the basis of different requirements-

51
00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:19,320
-for example.
 Building rules, strength and energy efficiency.

52
00:04:19,480 --> 00:04:23,200
The proposal was tested and re -examined.

53
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:27,480
New ideas meant that the student had to investigate new things.

54
00:04:27,640 --> 00:04:31,960
Then the ideas were developed into a good proposal for a solution.

55
00:04:32,120 --> 00:04:35,000
In the example, the student talked with a teacher-

56
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:39,640
-But most often the work must be documented, so save your sketches.

57
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:45,640
Sometimes a physical or digital model is needed to see that the proposal works.

58
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:47,800
The written documentation required

59
00:04:47,960 --> 00:04:52,840
-To see the teacher what choices and changes you have made.

60
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:56,440
So remember to motivate your choices.

61
00:04:56,600 --> 00:05:00,200
Technology development work is reflective work-

62
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:03,800
-Where you value and develop your proposal for a solution.

63
00:05:03,960 --> 00:05:10,360
It is an innovative work that you will benefit from in several subjects.

64
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:15,240
