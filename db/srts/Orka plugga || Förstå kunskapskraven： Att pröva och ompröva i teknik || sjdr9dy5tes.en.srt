1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,880
To systematically examine				and re-examine - Technology

2
00:00:05,840 --> 00:00:08,920
These days,
technological knowhow is critical.

3
00:00:09,080 --> 00:00:12,280
Technological improvements
solve many problems.

4
00:00:12,440 --> 00:00:18,480
The subject lets you develop your own
technological ideas and solutions.

5
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:23,560
Technological solutions require
creativity and problem solution.

6
00:00:23,720 --> 00:00:28,280
For instance, an architect has to first
identify and examine the needs-

7
00:00:28,440 --> 00:00:32,560
-and then try out proposals
using sketches and models.

8
00:00:32,720 --> 00:00:36,400
Perhaps the building needs to be green
as well as practical-

9
00:00:36,560 --> 00:00:39,400
-but still look nice
and be financially sound.

10
00:00:39,560 --> 00:00:45,160
From the finished draft, a blueprint
is made and the house can be built.

11
00:00:45,320 --> 00:00:50,440
Technology development in school
is a lot like the architect's process.

12
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:54,840
In order to assess the quality of your
work and give you things to improve-

13
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:58,360
-your teacher consults
the knowledge requirements.

14
00:00:58,520 --> 00:01:02,360
The requirements for technology,
grade nine, include:

15
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:07,160
"To perform simple technology
development and construction"-

16
00:01:07,320 --> 00:01:12,720
-"by systematically examining
and re-examining proposals"-

17
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:19,240
-"as well as design well-planned
physical or digital models."

18
00:01:20,360 --> 00:01:23,480
Systematically examining
and re-examining ideas-

19
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:27,040
-means to develop and adjust solutions
according to different needs.

20
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:29,720
Here is an example task:

21
00:01:29,880 --> 00:01:35,120
Make a digital blueprint of an Attefall
house that you would want to live in.

22
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:41,080
The house needs to be energy efficient
and made from sustainable materials.

23
00:01:41,240 --> 00:01:44,280
This is a map of the area.

24
00:01:44,440 --> 00:01:50,360
We've talked about Attefall houses.
They can be no larger than 25 sqm.

25
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:55,800
The neighbour's house is quite close,
so I'll move mine to the other side.

26
00:01:55,960 --> 00:01:57,760
According to Boverket-

27
00:01:57,920 --> 00:02:03,320
-Attefall houses need to be 4.5 metres
from the edge of the property.

28
00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:06,640
That's a good spot.
How tall should the house be?

29
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:10,480
They can be no more than 4 metres,
ground to roof ridge.

30
00:02:10,640 --> 00:02:13,000
There's no room for two floors-

31
00:02:13,160 --> 00:02:17,680
-but I can put in a loft,
freeing up floor space for furniture.

32
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:21,560
Good! Using the map
and the Boverket website-

33
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:25,240
-you examined
the conditions for your task.

34
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:30,680
You also factored in the need for space
in the form of a loft.

35
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:34,920
Last time,
we learned about solid constructions.

36
00:02:35,080 --> 00:02:38,000
What will you do in this case?

37
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:42,600
I'll use the roof truss
to make the loft.

38
00:02:42,760 --> 00:02:47,160
They will give it stability.
Any ideas about the foundation?

39
00:02:47,320 --> 00:02:52,480
I'll pour a concrete slab,
and in that, place a grid of rebars.

40
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:56,360
That improves the tensile strength
of the concrete.

41
00:02:56,520 --> 00:02:58,320
Solid foundation.

42
00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:03,960
Your use of words like concrete slab,
rebars and tensile strength-

43
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:08,320
-shows
that you can use proper terminology.

44
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:13,720
Are there any adjustments to be made
to make the house energy efficient?

45
00:03:13,880 --> 00:03:18,040
The key is to minimize heat loss
and maximize heat gain.

46
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:21,120
For instance, the house should not
be built in a shady spot.

47
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:23,560
Does that make you re-examine
anything?

48
00:03:23,720 --> 00:03:29,200
Yes. I have to move the house away
from the shade of the forest.

49
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:34,200
-Anything else?
-Yes, select the right wall insulation.

50
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:38,880
Implementing energy efficient solutions
gave you new ideas-

51
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:41,400
-which you show on your sketch.

52
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:44,960
But some work still remains
before you can make a blueprint.

53
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:49,320
All the measurements have to add up
and be according to scale.

54
00:03:49,480 --> 00:03:51,800
Let's leave the example.

55
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:56,000
Technology development in school
can be divided into stages:

56
00:03:56,160 --> 00:03:59,560
Defining the need, examination-

57
00:03:59,720 --> 00:04:03,960
-proposals, constructing a model-

58
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:06,960
-and tests and improvements.

59
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:11,680
In the example, we first defined
the need: to build an Attefall house.

60
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:14,680
The need was then examined
with different requirements in mind-

61
00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:19,320
-like building regulations, stability
and energy efficiency.

62
00:04:19,480 --> 00:04:23,200
The proposal was examined
and re-examined.

63
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:27,480
New ideas
made the pupil examine new aspects.

64
00:04:27,640 --> 00:04:31,960
The ideas then developed
into a sound proposal.

65
00:04:32,120 --> 00:04:35,000
In the example, the pupil
communicated with a teacher-

66
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:39,640
-but the process usually needs to be
documented, so save all sketches.

67
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:45,640
A physical or digital model may be
needed to see if the proposal works.

68
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:47,800
Written documentation is needed-

69
00:04:47,960 --> 00:04:52,840
-so your teacher can see what choices
and improvements you've made.

70
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:56,440
So remember to motivate your choices.

71
00:04:56,600 --> 00:05:00,200
Technology development
is a reflective process-

72
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:03,800
-where you assess
and develop your proposal.

73
00:05:03,960 --> 00:05:10,360
It's innovative work that will be
of use to you in several other subjects.
