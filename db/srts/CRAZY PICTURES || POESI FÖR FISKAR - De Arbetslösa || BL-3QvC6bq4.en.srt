1
00:00:13,179 --> 00:00:14,848
Damn!

2
00:01:43,343 --> 00:01:45,164
No no.
 Please.

3
00:01:45,164 --> 00:01:47,779
Give me the Ronny bag!

4
00:01:47,779 --> 00:01:50,164
My name is Bosse.

5
00:01:50,164 --> 00:01:51,450
Huh?

6
00:01:51,450 --> 00:01:55,063
Bosse.
 Bosse Nilsson is my name.

7
00:01:55,063 --> 00:01:57,472
But it was Ronny I would take the bag off.

8
00:01:57,472 --> 00:01:58,781
I would pick up the bag from Ronny.

9
00:01:58,781 --> 00:02:00,551
Ronny is at home and waving.

10
00:02:00,551 --> 00:02:02,986
His guy has got chickenpox.

11
00:02:02,986 --> 00:02:07,159
I am a substitute today.

12
00:02:15,525 --> 00:02:18,525
Hell fucking.

13
00:02:21,704 --> 00:02:24,499
Are you new to work or?

14
00:02:24,499 --> 00:02:26,080
I am on work testing.

15
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:28,192
Stefanovich has begun to take in a lot of unemployed from

16
00:02:28,192 --> 00:02:31,318
The employment office and receive support allowance and crap.

17
00:02:31,318 --> 00:02:35,473
Does Stefanovich get money from the state because you are his torpedo?

18
00:02:35,473 --> 00:02:36,908
Just.

19
00:02:36,908 --> 00:02:39,164
Is it really nice that they do so?

20
00:02:39,164 --> 00:02:40,985
I don't have to jiddra with the a-cash and stuff.

21
00:02:40,985 --> 00:02:43,062
And then I get experience and an entrance to the industry.

22
00:02:43,062 --> 00:02:44,626
It is very difficult to get a job!

23
00:02:44,626 --> 00:02:47,781
This could have been a good job to have on my resume.

24
00:02:47,781 --> 00:02:49,729
Well that's right.

25
00:02:49,729 --> 00:02:53,002
It is a tough labor market.
 It is.

26
00:02:58,602 --> 00:03:03,448
Is it good cash to wiggle or?
 Maybe had been something for me.

27
00:03:03,448 --> 00:03:07,127
No, I don't want to say that.

28
00:03:07,127 --> 00:03:09,704
I have been trying to get a full -time service for a few years

29
00:03:09,704 --> 00:03:13,858
But the company apparently benefits more from not hiring me.

30
00:03:13,858 --> 00:03:16,062
Sometimes it goes for fucking for several weeks without calling.

31
00:03:16,062 --> 00:03:17,062
Oh fuck.

32
00:03:17,062 --> 00:03:18,318
Yes it is not so damn fun.

33
00:03:18,318 --> 00:03:21,589
I have a damn bills and two kids there at home too.

34
00:03:21,589 --> 00:03:23,781
So damn not cheap.

35
00:03:23,781 --> 00:03:25,548
I mean.
 Had they said this, that I would keep on

36
00:03:25,548 --> 00:03:30,497
Jock around with the car and that you would come here and…

37
00:03:30,497 --> 00:03:32,858
Now you are going to shoot me too.

38
00:03:32,858 --> 00:03:37,038
Know in fuck if I had accepted this even.

39
00:03:37,038 --> 00:03:39,343
Fixed…

40
00:03:39,343 --> 00:03:43,241
It was actually Ronny that I would "Wasta".

41
00:03:43,241 --> 00:03:45,343
Yes, as I said, he is with a sick child.

42
00:03:45,343 --> 00:03:47,781
Yes but then we can do so I take the bag,

43
00:03:47,781 --> 00:03:50,012
And then I shoot you in the leg instead.

44
00:03:50,012 --> 00:03:51,497
What do you think about that?

45
00:03:51,497 --> 00:03:56,371
Yes it would be fantastic if it was possible to solve it that way.

46
00:03:56,371 --> 00:03:59,679
Damn it was nice.
 Thanks!

47
00:03:59,679 --> 00:04:00,679
Yes, oh ...

48
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:02,979
Ouch!!

49
00:04:05,908 --> 00:04:10,217
You, would it be okay if I use you as a reference then when I do my resume?

50
00:04:10,217 --> 00:04:12,602
Reference?

51
00:04:12,602 --> 00:04:16,910
Yes absolutely, this you did great!

52
00:04:29,499 --> 00:04:30,499
Down on your knees!

53
00:04:30,499 --> 00:04:31,499
What the hell?

54
00:04:31,499 --> 00:04:33,088
Down on your knees!

55
00:04:34,242 --> 00:04:35,987
What the hell are you doing?

56
00:04:35,987 --> 00:04:37,550
AJ as hell.

57
00:04:37,550 --> 00:04:39,986
Your little pig!

58
00:04:42,858 --> 00:04:44,142
Apapap!

59
00:04:44,142 --> 00:04:46,269
Then we take it damn quiet.

60
00:04:47,576 --> 00:04:51,858
Elin, we do not fire weapons without my command.

61
00:04:51,858 --> 00:04:54,600
How many times should I have to say it!

62
00:04:55,754 --> 00:04:58,062
Can I have the bag?

63
00:04:58,062 --> 00:05:00,447
So, who are you?

64
00:05:00,447 --> 00:05:01,652
Are you a police officer or?

65
00:05:01,652 --> 00:05:03,781
Yes.

66
00:05:03,781 --> 00:05:05,576
Yes.
 Or so ...

67
00:05:05,576 --> 00:05:08,139
I am on internship.
 Plugs for police.

68
00:05:08,139 --> 00:05:13,370
This is year class 6, Gripvallsskolan.

69
00:05:13,370 --> 00:05:15,293
They are on prao.

70
00:05:15,293 --> 00:05:18,319
If I get the bag so we come from here!

71
00:05:18,319 --> 00:05:21,443
Hello?
 What did I just say?

72
00:05:21,910 --> 00:05:23,422
Do you go on CSN then or?

73
00:05:23,422 --> 00:05:24,122
Sure.

74
00:05:24,122 --> 00:05:25,022
Oh fuck.

75
00:05:25,022 --> 00:05:27,576
Study debt up over the ears.

76
00:05:27,576 --> 00:05:32,781
Damn .. I don't get a job after this I sit in the shit.

77
00:05:32,781 --> 00:05:34,807
We just said that before you arrived.

78
00:05:34,807 --> 00:05:38,730
That it is a damn tough labor market.
 After all, there are no jobs!

79
00:05:39,961 --> 00:05:43,012
That's enough!

80
00:05:43,012 --> 00:05:46,908
Put down the weapons everyone!

81
00:05:46,908 --> 00:05:51,626
I will bring this with your Miss.
 And we'll see how fun it gets

82
00:05:51,626 --> 00:05:55,397
When it comes to the development talks this fall.

83
00:05:56,576 --> 00:05:59,581
If I get the bag now so we get out of here!

84
00:06:12,541 --> 00:06:16,028
What the hell does the military here?

85
00:06:20,028 --> 00:06:22,648
Turn if we have everything under control ...

86
00:06:26,875 --> 00:06:28,207
No, stop it.
 Do not shoot.

87
00:06:28,207 --> 00:06:30,285
I'm only on work testing.

88
00:06:30,874 --> 00:06:32,644
Take the bag.

89
00:06:32,644 --> 00:06:36,311
It must be a-cash for me.

90
00:06:48,721 --> 00:06:50,696
You…

91
00:06:50,696 --> 00:06:53,233
Home service,

92
00:06:53,233 --> 00:06:56,311
Is it difficult to get a job there?

93
00:06:56,311 --> 00:06:57,644
Yes.

94
00:06:57,644 --> 00:07:00,387
There are almost no places left now, after all,

95
00:07:00,387 --> 00:07:02,824
When people have to work until they are 80 years old.

96
00:07:02,824 --> 00:07:07,285
Most people have time to work to death before they get so old that they need care.

97
00:07:07,285 --> 00:07:10,747
But Einar here, he is struggling.

98
00:07:10,747 --> 00:07:13,619
Next year, then there will be a pension.

99
00:07:13,619 --> 00:07:15,438
Nice huh?

100
00:07:15,438 --> 00:07:17,207
What did you say?

101
00:07:17,207 --> 00:07:21,721
It is absolutely fucking incredible that it should be so difficult to get an ordinary ...

102
00:07:21,721 --> 00:07:23,952
Full -time service!

103
00:07:23,952 --> 00:07:25,978
What did you say for something?

104
00:07:27,029 --> 00:07:28,130
A full -time job.

105
00:07:29,003 --> 00:07:30,029
A full -time job?

106
00:07:30,542 --> 00:07:32,233
A full -time job?

107
00:07:33,823 --> 00:07:35,798
A full -time job!

108
00:08:07,760 --> 00:08:13,415
And then they struck the last real employment contract.

109
00:08:13,415 --> 00:08:15,134
And my children.

110
00:08:15,134 --> 00:08:18,360
It was the story of the full -time service.

111
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:19,720
Wow!

112
00:08:20,646 --> 00:08:22,673
Now it's time to go to bed.

113
00:08:22,673 --> 00:08:23,673
But Mom.

114
00:08:23,673 --> 00:08:24,373
Not already!

115
00:08:24,373 --> 00:08:25,673
Yes!

116
00:08:27,005 --> 00:08:30,723
When I grow up, I want a unicorn and a full -time job.

117
00:08:30,723 --> 00:08:35,365
But you realize that there are no full -time services really your stupid.

118
00:08:35,365 --> 00:08:37,134
Good night grandmother!

119
00:08:37,134 --> 00:08:41,673
Good night my kids.
 Sweet Dreams.
