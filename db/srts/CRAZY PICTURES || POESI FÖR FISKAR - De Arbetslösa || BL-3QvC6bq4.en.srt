00:00:08,430 --> 00:00:10,976
THE UNEMPLOYED

2
00:00:13,179 --> 00:00:14,848
Fuck!

3
00:01:43,343 --> 00:01:45,164
No, no. Please.

4
00:01:45,164 --> 00:01:47,779
Hand me the bag, Ronny!

5
00:01:47,779 --> 00:01:50,164
I’m Bosse.

6
00:01:50,164 --> 00:01:51,450
What?

7
00:01:51,450 --> 00:01:55,063
Bosse. Bosse Nilsson 
is my name.

8
00:01:55,063 --> 00:01:57,472
But it was Ronny I was 
supposed to take the bag from.

9
00:01:57,472 --> 00:01:58,781
It was supposed to be Ronny.

10
00:01:58,781 --> 00:02:00,551
Ronny is home with his kid today.

11
00:02:00,551 --> 00:02:02,986
His boy’s got chicken pox.

12
00:02:02,986 --> 00:02:07,159
I’m filling in for him.

13
00:02:15,525 --> 00:02:18,525
Fucking shit.

14
00:02:21,704 --> 00:02:24,499
So, are you new on the job?

15
00:02:24,499 --> 00:02:26,080
I am on my probation period.

16
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:28,192
Stefanovich has started to 
take in loads of people from

17
00:02:28,192 --> 00:02:31,318
the unemployment office
to get funding and shit.

18
00:02:31,318 --> 00:02:35,473
Wait, Stefanovich gets funded by the 
government because you’re his hitman?

19
00:02:35,473 --> 00:02:36,908
Right.

20
00:02:36,908 --> 00:02:39,164
Is it really fair of them to do that?

21
00:02:39,164 --> 00:02:40,985
Well, I don’t have to deal with 
unemployment benefits and stuff.

22
00:02:40,985 --> 00:02:43,062
And I’ll get experience and 
a way in to the business.

23
00:02:43,062 --> 00:02:44,626
It’s really hard to get a job!

24
00:02:44,626 --> 00:02:47,781
And this could be a great job 
for me to put on my CV.

25
00:02:47,781 --> 00:02:49,729
Yeah, you’re right.

26
00:02:49,729 --> 00:02:53,002
It’s a tough market out there. It is.

27
00:02:58,602 --> 00:03:03,448
Is there good money in being a sub? 
Maybe that’s something I could do.

28
00:03:03,448 --> 00:03:07,127
No, I wouldn’t say so.

29
00:03:07,127 --> 00:03:09,704
I’ve tried to get a full time 
contract for some years now.

30
00:03:09,704 --> 00:03:13,858
But the firm, they apparently 
profit from not hiring me.

31
00:03:13,858 --> 00:03:16,062
Sometimes it’s fucking 
weeks until they call me.

32
00:03:16,062 --> 00:03:17,062
Fuck that.

33
00:03:17,062 --> 00:03:18,318
Yeah it’s no damn picnic.

34
00:03:18,318 --> 00:03:21,589
I’ve got fucking bills 
and two kids at home.

35
00:03:21,589 --> 00:03:23,781
That’s not fucking cheap, you know.

36
00:03:23,781 --> 00:03:25,448
If someone would have
told me about this,

37
00:03:25,448 --> 00:03:30,497
that I would be rolling around with the
car and you would show up here and...

38
00:03:30,497 --> 00:03:32,858
Now you’re gonna shoot me and all.

39
00:03:32,858 --> 00:03:37,038
Fuck knows if I even would 
have said yes to this.

40
00:03:37,038 --> 00:03:39,343
But…

41
00:03:39,343 --> 00:03:43,241
It was actually Ronny that 
I was supposed to ”waste”.

42
00:03:43,241 --> 00:03:45,343
Well, he’s home 
with sick kids.

43
00:03:45,343 --> 00:03:47,781
Yeah, but what we could 
do is, I’ll take the bag,

44
00:03:47,781 --> 00:03:50,012
and then I’ll shoot you
in the leg instead.

45
00:03:50,012 --> 00:03:51,497
What do you think about that?

46
00:03:51,497 --> 00:03:56,371
Yeah, it would really be fantastic
if we could settle it that way.

47
00:03:56,371 --> 00:03:59,679
Fucking decent of you, man. 
Thanks!

48
00:03:59,679 --> 00:04:00,679
Yeah, well..

49
00:04:05,908 --> 00:04:10,217
Hey, would it be alright if I use you 
as a reference when I write my CV?

50
00:04:10,217 --> 00:04:12,602
Reference?

51
00:04:12,602 --> 00:04:16,910
Yeah, absolutely, 
you handled this great!

52
00:04:29,499 --> 00:04:30,499
On your knees!

53
00:04:30,499 --> 00:04:31,499
What the fuck?

54
00:04:31,499 --> 00:04:33,088
On your knees!

55
00:04:34,242 --> 00:04:35,987
What the fuck are you doing!

56
00:04:35,987 --> 00:04:37,550
Fucking hell.

57
00:04:37,550 --> 00:04:39,986
You little bastard!

58
00:04:42,858 --> 00:04:44,142
Apapap!

59
00:04:44,142 --> 00:04:46,269
Let’s all chill the fuck down.

60
00:04:47,576 --> 00:04:51,858
Elin, we don’t fire weapons 
without my command.

61
00:04:51,858 --> 00:04:54,600
How many times do I have to tell you?

62
00:04:55,754 --> 00:04:58,062
Hand me the bag.

63
00:04:58,062 --> 00:05:00,447
Seriously, who are you?

64
00:05:00,447 --> 00:05:01,652
Are you a cop, or…?

65
00:05:01,652 --> 00:05:03,781
Yeah.

66
00:05:03,781 --> 00:05:05,576
Or actually...

67
00:05:05,576 --> 00:05:08,139
I’m in training. Still in the academy.

68
00:05:08,139 --> 00:05:13,370
These are 5th graders, 
from Gripvall Elementary.

69
00:05:13,370 --> 00:05:15,293
They’re doing work experience.

70
00:05:15,293 --> 00:05:18,319
Give me the bag now so 
we can get out of here!

71
00:05:18,319 --> 00:05:21,443
Hey! What did I just say?

72
00:05:21,910 --> 00:05:23,422
Are you on a student loan then or?

73
00:05:23,422 --> 00:05:24,122
Yeah.

74
00:05:24,122 --> 00:05:25,022
Damn.

75
00:05:25,022 --> 00:05:27,576
Drowning in debt.

76
00:05:27,576 --> 00:05:32,781
Shit.. If I don’t get a job 
after this I’m fucked.

77
00:05:32,781 --> 00:05:34,807
We just said that before you came.

78
00:05:34,807 --> 00:05:38,730
That it’s a fucking tough labor market. 
There are no damn jobs!

79
00:05:39,961 --> 00:05:43,012
That’s enough!

80
00:05:43,012 --> 00:05:46,908
Everybody put your weapons down!

81
00:05:46,908 --> 00:05:49,326
I will bring this up with your teacher

82
00:05:49,326 --> 00:05:55,397
and then we’ll see who’s laughing 
at the evaluation talks next fall.

83
00:05:56,576 --> 00:05:59,581
Give me the bag now so 
we can get out of here.

84
00:06:12,541 --> 00:06:16,028
What the fuck is the
military doing here?

85
00:06:20,028 --> 00:06:22,648
Go back, we got it
all under control…

86
00:06:26,875 --> 00:06:28,207
No stop it. Don’t shoot.

87
00:06:28,207 --> 00:06:30,285
I’m just on probation.
Come on.

88
00:06:30,874 --> 00:06:32,644
Take… Take the bag.

89
00:06:32,644 --> 00:06:36,311
It’s unemployment 
benefits for me.

90
00:06:48,721 --> 00:06:50,696
Hey…

91
00:06:50,696 --> 00:06:53,233
The home care business.

92
00:06:53,233 --> 00:06:56,311
Is it hard to get work there?

93
00:06:56,311 --> 00:06:57,644
Yeah.

94
00:06:57,644 --> 00:07:00,387
I mean, there are barely any 
positions left anymore,

95
00:07:00,387 --> 00:07:02,824
now that people have to 
work until they’re 80.

96
00:07:02,824 --> 00:07:07,285
Most will work themselves to death
before they’re old enough to need caring.

97
00:07:07,285 --> 00:07:10,747
But Einar here, he’s a fighter.

98
00:07:10,747 --> 00:07:13,619
Next year it’s retirement.

99
00:07:13,619 --> 00:07:15,438
Nice, huh?

100
00:07:15,438 --> 00:07:17,207
What?

101
00:07:17,207 --> 00:07:21,721
It's fucking incredible that it has 
to be so fucking hard to get a simple...

102
00:07:21,721 --> 00:07:23,952
Full-time employment!

103
00:07:23,952 --> 00:07:25,978
What did you just say?

104
00:07:27,029 --> 00:07:28,130
A full-time employment.

105
00:07:29,003 --> 00:07:30,029
A full-time employment?

106
00:07:30,542 --> 00:07:32,233
A full-time employment?

107
00:07:33,823 --> 00:07:35,798
A full-time employment!

108
00:08:07,760 --> 00:08:13,415
And then they ripped the 
last real employment contract.

109
00:08:13,415 --> 00:08:15,134
And that, my children.

110
00:08:15,134 --> 00:08:18,415
That was the tale of the 
full-time employment.

111
00:08:20,646 --> 00:08:22,673
Now, it’s time for bed.

112
00:08:22,673 --> 00:08:23,673
But mom.

113
00:08:23,673 --> 00:08:24,373
Not already!

114
00:08:24,373 --> 00:08:25,673
Yes!

115
00:08:27,005 --> 00:08:30,723
When I grow up I want a unicorn 
and a full-time employment.

116
00:08:30,723 --> 00:08:35,365
Full-time employments 
aren’t real, stupid.

117
00:08:35,365 --> 00:08:37,134
Good night, grandma!

118
00:08:37,134 --> 00:08:41,673
Good night my children. 
Sweet dreams.

119
00:08:45,647 --> 00:08:49,185
THE UNEMPLOYED
