1
00:00:04,960 --> 00:00:06,720
Is the energy over?

2
00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:09,360
Do you feel tired and maybe grumpy at the lessons?

3
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:13,200
Are you thinking more about going home than about what your teachers say?

4
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:14,840
Nothing strange about it!

5
00:00:14,840 --> 00:00:17,320
You get tired of being in school.

6
00:00:17,320 --> 00:00:20,640
After sitting on lessons that require you to be focused

7
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:23,600
You may just be longing to go home and rest.

8
00:00:24,680 --> 00:00:26,720
- How far is it left?

9
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:28,680
- Now it's 25 minutes left

10
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,040
It can be difficult to sit still,

11
00:00:32,040 --> 00:00:34,560
hard to let you talk to friends

12
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:38,200
And hard to concentrate on what you should do.

13
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:42,760
- Then we will take and finish!

14
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:50,760
But you actually don't just have lessons on the schedule

15
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:52,080
Without also breaks.

16
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:53,320
Take advantage of them!

17
00:00:55,360 --> 00:00:58,320
It's easy to just sink down in front of the computer or mobile

18
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:00,480
and play or scroll away the time.

19
00:01:01,480 --> 00:01:04,160
If you often sit still the whole break

20
00:01:04,160 --> 00:01:05,920
Try to break that pattern!

21
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:10,160
By doing something active you will be more attractive and happier.

22
00:01:10,160 --> 00:01:12,200
And then it can be more at the lessons!

23
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:14,440
- Are you going?
 We'll play ping pong!

24
00:01:14,440 --> 00:01:17,240
For when moving, substances are released in the brain

25
00:01:17,240 --> 00:01:19,640
such as serotonin and dopamine

26
00:01:19,640 --> 00:01:21,280
that counteracts depression.

27
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:24,360
And besides being happier,

28
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:27,200
can memory improve, stress decrease

29
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:29,200
And then you will sleep better!

30
00:01:33,880 --> 00:01:37,000
Also think about whether you feel best about spending time with your friends

31
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,440
Or if you would feel good to be for yourself for a while.

32
00:01:39,440 --> 00:01:43,200
- my best tip on what to do on the break it is to

33
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:45,880
Play basketball and be with friends.

34
00:01:46,360 --> 00:01:48,640
So to cope more on the lessons,

35
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:50,000
Take advantage of your breaks.

36
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:54,040
Feel free to stir and go out for a while to get fresh air.

37
00:01:54,040 --> 00:01:57,800
Often it is enough to just go for a short walk for more energy.

38
00:01:57,800 --> 00:02:00,560
- When I just sat inside I have felt that

39
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:03,560
lessons are much boring

40
00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:06,760
You get unjustified to work.

41
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:12,760
- Feels nice when you have been moving a little

42
00:02:12,760 --> 00:02:14,680
so that one can concentrate more on the lesson

43
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:16,800
- I think the best thing about being active on their break is to

44
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:20,560
You can be a little more motivated for school work.

45
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:23,440
- I think the best thing about being active on the break is that you

46
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:25,760
becomes spiked on the lessons

47
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:28,160
- And you can work more because you are more attractive!
