00:00:06,083 --> 00:00:10,208
Hi, my name is Shevin and I am an administrator at Försäkringskassan.

2
00:00:10,250 --> 00:00:14,750
In this movie we will explain how you do to seek compensation and how

3
00:00:14,750 --> 00:00:20,375
A lot of compensation you receive when you participate in a program at the Employment Service.

4
00:00:20,458 --> 00:00:23,458
When you participate in a program at the Employment Service

5
00:00:23,458 --> 00:00:28,208
The Social Insurance Office that decides on and pays out your compensation.

6
00:00:28,291 --> 00:00:30,625
You shall apply for compensation on my pages

7
00:00:30,625 --> 00:00:33,625
on the Swedish Social Insurance Agency's website.

8
00:00:33,666 --> 00:00:36,625
You apply for the compensation afterwards by the fact that

9
00:00:36,625 --> 00:00:41,125
Report how you participated in the program the month before.

10
00:00:41,208 --> 00:00:44,375
If your application has been received by the Swedish Social Insurance Agency last

11
00:00:44,416 --> 00:00:49,250
The seventh you will receive your compensation the same month on the 26th.

12
00:00:49,250 --> 00:00:53,000
If your application comes in to the Social Insurance Office after the seventh

13
00:00:53,083 --> 00:00:57,958
Do you receive compensation on the 26th month after.

14
00:00:58,041 --> 00:01:01,083
Your application must be at the Social Insurance Office no later than

15
00:01:01,083 --> 00:01:06,166
the last day of the month after the month you are looking for compensation for.

16
00:01:06,250 --> 00:01:09,250
Otherwise, you may not get any money at all.

17
00:01:09,500 --> 00:01:12,833
Keep in mind that it takes a month before you receive any compensation

18
00:01:12,833 --> 00:01:14,416
When you start in a program,

19
00:01:14,416 --> 00:01:19,291
Because you apply for and receive compensation afterwards.

20
00:01:19,375 --> 00:01:22,166
What compensation is there and how much money do you get?

21
00:01:22,166 --> 00:01:25,291
If you are a member of the A-box then calculate

22
00:01:25,333 --> 00:01:28,291
The Social Insurance Office your compensation based on

23
00:01:28,375 --> 00:01:32,250
What you would have received in unemployment benefits.

24
00:01:32,250 --> 00:01:35,000
The compensation is called activity support.

25
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,916
And you have to pay tax on it.

26
00:01:37,916 --> 00:01:41,666
If you are not a member of the a-kassan and have reached the age of 25

27
00:01:41,666 --> 00:01:45,750
Do you receive 223 \ HKRONOR per day in activity support

28
00:01:45,833 --> 00:01:48,375
that you pay tax on.

29
00:01:48,375 --> 00:01:50,875
If you are not a member of the a-kassan and are

30
00:01:50,875 --> 00:01:54,416
For 25 years you will receive development compensation.

31
00:01:54,500 --> 00:01:57,333
You do not have to pay tax on it.

32
00:01:57,333 --> 00:02:01,750
Development compensation is different depending on whether you have completed

33
00:02:01,750 --> 00:02:06,708
High school or not and the amounts are updated every year.

34
00:02:06,791 --> 00:02:07,791
On our site

35
00:02:07,791 --> 00:02:11,583
you can see the current amount for development compensation.

36
00:02:11,666 --> 00:02:15,083
If you are part of the establishment program and meet the conditions

37
00:02:15,083 --> 00:02:19,625
you can receive establishment compensation of SEK 308 \ HKR per day.

38
00:02:19,708 --> 00:02:23,291
You can also receive compensation during your mapping time.

39
00:02:23,375 --> 00:02:27,125
The amount is then SEK 231 \ SEK per day.

40
00:02:27,208 --> 00:02:31,208
You will pay no tax on establishment compensation.

41
00:02:31,250 --> 00:02:34,791
When you apply for compensation, you should report what days you

42
00:02:34,791 --> 00:02:39,625
have participated in your program and what days you have been absent,

43
00:02:39,708 --> 00:02:44,708
For example, if you have been ill or been home with a sick child.

44
00:02:44,791 --> 00:02:47,166
When you are absent due to illness

45
00:02:47,166 --> 00:02:50,500
Do you have to report it to the Employment Service.

46
00:02:50,541 --> 00:02:54,458
You must report sick leave the first day you are sick.

47
00:02:54,541 --> 00:02:57,291
If you are sick for more than a week you need too

48
00:02:57,291 --> 00:03:00,291
submit a medical certificate to the Employment Service.

49
00:03:00,333 --> 00:03:03,083
The Employment Service's website contains information

50
00:03:03,083 --> 00:03:08,250
About what you need to do in other types of absence.

51
00:03:08,458 --> 00:03:12,916
You do not need to contact the Swedish Social Insurance Agency immediately when you are absent.

52
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,583
But when you apply for compensation, you must indicate

53
00:03:15,583 --> 00:03:18,750
What days you have been absent.

54
00:03:18,833 --> 00:03:22,833
If you have worked, you should report how much salary you have received.

55
00:03:22,833 --> 00:03:27,208
You do this while applying for compensation.

56
00:03:27,208 --> 00:03:28,708
More information can be found

57
00:03:28,708 --> 00:03:31,958
On our website fk.se.

58
00:03:32,041 --> 00:03:35,375
There you should also apply for compensation every month.

59
00:03:35,458 --> 00:03:37,958
You do this on my pages.

60
00:03:37,958 --> 00:03:42,250
Remember that you leave your information on honor and conscience.

61
00:03:42,291 --> 00:03:46,666
The Social Insurance Office checks that the information has been correct.

62
00:03:46,750 --> 00:03:48,916
Good luck on the road to your new job!
