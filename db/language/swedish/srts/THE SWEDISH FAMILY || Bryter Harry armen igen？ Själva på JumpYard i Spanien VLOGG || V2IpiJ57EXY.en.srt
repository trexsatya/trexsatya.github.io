1
00:00:00,134 --> 00:00:02,002
So, here we live.

2
00:00:02,269 --> 00:00:03,403
Pink.

3
00:00:03,537 --> 00:00:06,116
- Is that your favorite color?
 - Yes.
 Pink.

4
00:00:06,939 --> 00:00:08,941
I'm so peppy.

5
00:00:09,008 --> 00:00:11,009
Alma, come!

6
00:00:11,209 --> 00:00:13,078
I have never felt like such a bad parent.

7
00:00:16,081 --> 00:00:17,196
No!

8
00:00:25,020 --> 00:00:28,023
Hello Hello!

9
00:00:28,156 --> 00:00:29,958
We stand outside ...

10
00:00:30,091 --> 00:00:32,426
Jumpyard!

11
00:00:32,502 --> 00:00:34,794
In Madrid!

12
00:00:35,195 --> 00:00:37,297
And that is in Spain.

13
00:00:37,363 --> 00:00:41,700
"Yes!"
 Should we go in, right?
 It is early in the morning of course, we are first in place.

14
00:00:41,767 --> 00:00:44,069
And it's very cold outside, so we hurry in.

15
00:00:47,530 --> 00:00:50,874
- (Alma Harry Tjar to) - Good morning!

16
00:00:50,941 --> 00:00:52,542
- Hello!
 - Hello!

17
00:00:52,610 --> 00:00:55,011
- How's it going?
 - Good!
 How are you?

18
00:00:55,077 --> 00:00:59,014
Yes it is good.
 It is clear that Mister Jumpyard is in place.

19
00:00:59,081 --> 00:01:03,084
You can almost believe that there is a Mister Jumpyard on every Jumpyard.

20
00:01:03,151 --> 00:01:06,687
Exactly.
 I have cloned myself and work everywhere.

21
00:01:07,687 --> 00:01:09,956
- Should you give these to Harry?
 - Yes.

22
00:01:10,023 --> 00:01:11,631
Yes, come on!

23
00:01:14,693 --> 00:01:19,697
Are they to me?
 How nice of you.

24
00:01:20,031 --> 00:01:22,766
You have to have jumping socks.

25
00:01:22,850 --> 00:01:24,568
Thank you thank you!

26
00:01:24,701 --> 00:01:29,870
And these to Dad.
 Do you think they fit?
 Are they good for dad?

27
00:01:30,291 --> 00:01:31,606
Huh?

28
00:01:31,769 --> 00:01:35,877
What?
 Should I have ten, then?
 One to each toe type.

29
00:01:35,943 --> 00:01:37,678
Very small, right?

30
00:01:37,758 --> 00:01:40,147
No, but God, this is Laura-Size, right?

31
00:01:40,213 --> 00:01:44,350
- Yes, it almost looks that way.
 - XXS.
 Extra extra small.

32
00:01:44,417 --> 00:01:50,021
Look, now you come with some that may be better.
 These look good.
 Thanks, Laura!

33
00:01:50,309 --> 00:01:57,360
- Worst what she liked to work here, then.
 - Yes.
 She may be their youngest addition here.

34
00:01:57,694 --> 00:02:01,030
Oh, thank you, Laura.
 How nice of you!

35
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:06,186
- Too short.
 - Is it too short?

36
00:02:06,234 --> 00:02:10,030
- Mom ... on it.
 - Yes, I'll touch.

37
00:02:10,090 --> 00:02:13,740
- It is there?
 - Yes.
 What color did you get, then?

38
00:02:13,807 --> 00:02:14,941
Pink.

39
00:02:15,008 --> 00:02:18,490
- Is that your favorite color?
 - Yes.
 Pink.

40
00:02:19,678 --> 00:02:25,210
- She is completely obsessed with pink.
 - Yes, though my favorite color is actually pink.

41
00:02:25,816 --> 00:02:32,256
- It was Harry's favorite color before.
 - Yes, but Harry's favorite color is actually yellow now.

42
00:02:32,688 --> 00:02:33,689
Look at that.

43
00:02:33,756 --> 00:02:40,027
- What time it takes for you to take on you.
 - Oh, how fast you were.
 What a professional!

44
00:02:41,762 --> 00:02:43,261
"High five!"

45
00:02:48,156 --> 00:02:53,114
- Oh, what a climbing ward!
 - Oh, wow!

46
00:02:55,673 --> 00:02:58,208
- Oh, do you see the disco ball?
 - Well, then!

47
00:02:58,275 --> 00:03:00,944
Yes, there is a disco ball up there.

48
00:03:01,745 --> 00:03:07,683
It is so cool that there are two floors.
 It gets much bigger.

49
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:14,908
I'm so peppy.
 Alma, come!

50
00:03:15,155 --> 00:03:19,010
- Can we just run away?
 - Yes do it!

51
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,628
Wait!
 Wait, Harry!

52
00:03:22,761 --> 00:03:29,700
So up here are the trampolines, and then you see the end of the climbing walls.

53
00:03:30,034 --> 00:03:33,970
Very cool "layout."
 You say so?
 "Layout."

54
00:03:34,061 --> 00:03:37,006
- Yes you could say that.
 - "Layout" by the park.

55
00:03:37,073 --> 00:03:39,141
- Really cool.
 - Yes.

56
00:03:39,274 --> 00:03:45,479
And there are big, big windows so I suspect it is a great view as well.

57
00:03:46,814 --> 00:03:54,353
Of course.
 It doesn't really see you, but that's it.
 You look out over Madrid.

58
00:03:55,220 --> 00:03:59,223
Although we are completely alone in the park, it is not just us who make sound.

59
00:03:59,311 --> 00:04:01,259
It is a...

60
00:04:01,492 --> 00:04:07,030
Yes, some type of air conditioning plant that just whistles and sounds.

61
00:04:07,196 --> 00:04:12,034
- They hear it, I promise.
 - I hope you stand out with the sound.

62
00:04:12,669 --> 00:04:16,837
- How's it going, Harry?
 - It's fine.

63
00:04:17,004 --> 00:04:18,001
Woho!

64
00:04:23,009 --> 00:04:25,077
This one gives me anxiety.

65
00:04:25,144 --> 00:04:27,279
(Whistle) Does anyone remember?

66
00:04:27,346 --> 00:04:31,516
What was that?
 Someone did something that one must not do.

67
00:04:31,683 --> 00:04:36,019
But what I would say ... do you remember when Harry broke your arm?

68
00:04:36,086 --> 00:04:39,489
- How could they forget it?
 - They may not have followed us for so long.

69
00:04:39,555 --> 00:04:40,623
No its true.

70
00:04:40,690 --> 00:04:45,093
After all, he hung in these "monkey bars", as they are called, and fell down.

71
00:04:45,161 --> 00:04:51,165
He dropped and fell, and then he put his hand down and then both legs were broken.

72
00:04:51,231 --> 00:04:55,960
I have never felt like such a bad parent, as I did there and then.

73
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:59,420
- No.
 - "Never Again," we hope.
 (Never again)

74
00:04:59,471 --> 00:05:03,941
But now he has a fully functioning arm and is up and climbing new stuff.

75
00:05:04,008 --> 00:05:04,963
Mm.

76
00:05:06,343 --> 00:05:09,179
Ah!
 No no...

77
00:05:12,348 --> 00:05:14,197
No!

78
00:05:15,115 --> 00:05:19,354
- Lucky it is soft ground.
 - Yes.

79
00:05:35,366 --> 00:05:38,602
- It's only at the top all the time.
 - Yes.

80
00:05:38,700 --> 00:05:42,505
Isn't the thing it should be different?
 Yes, now!
 Check.

81
00:05:42,839 --> 00:05:44,540
null

82
00:05:44,668 --> 00:05:47,409
- Oh, you won big!
 - Yes.

83
00:05:47,476 --> 00:05:48,744
Nice job, Alma!

84
00:06:21,670 --> 00:06:25,072
Jumpyard has an offer in the Swedish Family Club.

85
00:06:25,139 --> 00:06:31,344
Yeah.
 20% discount on one hour jump, two hours of jump, and family jump.

86
00:06:31,411 --> 00:06:36,081
One and two hours.
 And then we talk about Jumpyard in Sweden.

87
00:06:36,148 --> 00:06:36,949
Yes.

88
00:06:37,020 --> 00:06:41,085
And for those of you who don't know, our club is completely free for members.

89
00:06:41,152 --> 00:06:49,507
And inside you will find many good discounted offers and also sometimes giveaways and competitions.

90
00:06:49,559 --> 00:06:50,110
Mm.

91
00:06:50,170 --> 00:06:58,530
- And Jumpyard also has a giveaway inside the club.
 - Yes.
 20 500 kroner ...

92
00:06:58,632 --> 00:07:00,234
- Gift certificate.
 - Thanks.

93
00:07:00,300 --> 00:07:05,271
Very generous.
 20 club members have the chance to get it.

94
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:08,674
So if you are not members you have to be, you understand.

95
00:07:08,769 --> 00:07:09,808
Yes.

96
00:07:09,875 --> 00:07:14,145
- There is a link in the video text.
 - Check it out.

97
00:07:14,211 --> 00:07:15,679
Yes do it.

98
00:07:27,355 --> 00:07:31,520
- What do you do?
 - We pretend to sleep, like we've been waiting for a long time.

99
00:07:31,570 --> 00:07:32,759
You have to be quiet.

100
00:07:32,847 --> 00:07:36,720
It was a competition with the elevator.

101
00:07:43,334 --> 00:07:45,320
Gosh!

102
00:07:46,003 --> 00:07:48,405
What time you took.

103
00:07:48,472 --> 00:07:52,020
- Oh, what a superyoutuber!
 - We're home now.

104
00:07:52,356 --> 00:07:57,360
She didn't even react to the fact that you were lying there.
 What a "fail!"
 (failure)

105
00:07:58,120 --> 00:07:59,547
- Daniel?
 - Yes?

106
00:07:59,614 --> 00:08:01,282
- Want it.
 - Do you want it?

107
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:03,343
- mm.
 - Yes.

108
00:08:05,152 --> 00:08:06,686
Gosh!

109
00:08:06,820 --> 00:08:11,490
Where.
 Second foot, neat.
 And we pull it up.

110
00:08:11,557 --> 00:08:14,292
Oh, wait.
 If you take your arms straight out in the side ...

111
00:08:14,359 --> 00:08:16,027
Can you climb when you are so small?

112
00:08:16,094 --> 00:08:20,431
We will test.
 If the harness sits as it should, it is no wonder.

113
00:08:20,530 --> 00:08:23,299
- It feels very small.
 - Wait, Laura.

114
00:08:23,366 --> 00:08:26,469
But shouldn't it feel small and cramped?
 Isn't that the whole thing?

115
00:08:26,535 --> 00:08:33,007
- No.
 - I don't want it to feel big and loose anyway when I climb.

116
00:08:36,610 --> 00:08:39,679
- Mom.
 - Oh.

117
00:08:39,846 --> 00:08:46,184
Shall I help you?
 Should we go elevator again?
 Come, then we go the elevator.

118
00:08:46,618 --> 00:08:49,353
I'll hold in you.
 Oh!

119
00:08:49,487 --> 00:08:51,355
And feel now, the elevator.
 Wieee!

120
00:08:51,355 --> 00:08:53,090
- Daniel, I'm starting to climb.
 - Yes do it.

121
00:08:53,156 --> 00:08:58,694
Once again, come on.
 And the elevator, hold in. Wieee!

122
00:08:59,028 --> 00:09:01,317
- Yes, it was a little scary, right?
 - Yes.

123
00:09:01,363 --> 00:09:03,790
- That's why we take it slowly.
 - Yes.

124
00:09:03,850 --> 00:09:05,633
- Do you want to go elevator again?
 - The.

125
00:09:05,700 --> 00:09:08,469
The?
 Yes, climb here, you.

126
00:09:08,669 --> 00:09:12,504
Yes, take hold here.
 Can you take it?
 Then you have to move forward.

127
00:09:12,872 --> 00:09:15,338
Yes, I hold you.
 Come.

128
00:09:15,674 --> 00:09:20,078
- Nice!
 - Oh, the first time in this harness.
 Gold.

129
00:09:20,168 --> 00:09:22,146
And then you can grab it.

130
00:09:22,280 --> 00:09:24,415
Take that hand.
 Exactly.

131
00:09:24,481 --> 00:09:27,900
Oh!
 It is a little difficult.
 We do it like this.

132
00:09:28,685 --> 00:09:32,688
And then you grab there.
 And now, Laura, you can set foot there.

133
00:09:32,821 --> 00:09:37,525
And then you pull up.
 Great!
 And now it became difficult.

134
00:09:38,693 --> 00:09:40,894
Alma, what a speed!

135
00:09:40,961 --> 00:09:43,230
- (Daniel) How old are you now, Laura?
 - (Laura) uaua.

136
00:09:43,296 --> 00:09:45,846
How old are you, uaua?

137
00:09:52,908 --> 00:09:55,673
- Was it fun?
 - Yes.

138
00:09:56,085 --> 00:10:00,677
It's so smart, this system where you secure yourself.

139
00:10:07,515 --> 00:10:15,021
- I just want to feel that it's okay to climb on.
 - Yes, Daniel said that you can get some scrapes on this wall.

140
00:10:15,155 --> 00:10:18,291
Yes, it's a bit "scary."
 (scary)

141
00:10:18,424 --> 00:10:24,562
It is made to mimic a mountain.
 Or it's some kind of stone, but yes ...

142
00:10:24,639 --> 00:10:27,770
But it's kind of a volcano.
 Check.

143
00:10:29,166 --> 00:10:36,205
Ah, now I see.
 I get it.
 But, yes ... that hurts a little then, maybe.

144
00:10:36,272 --> 00:10:39,741
Yes.
 I won't run it now, I think.

145
00:10:40,475 --> 00:10:43,154
Wooo!
 Great!

146
00:10:45,345 --> 00:10:48,415
- What did you say?
 Do you want to remove it?
 - Yes.

147
00:10:48,481 --> 00:10:53,485
Yes we can do that.
 You were very capable, after all!
 You came super high!

148
00:10:53,552 --> 00:10:57,155
- Yes.
 - Yes, almost all the way up.

149
00:10:57,488 --> 00:11:00,357
It is a joy to record with Daniel.

150
00:11:00,450 --> 00:11:06,362
Partly because he knows how to record and what to think about.
 That you should not talk to each other.

151
00:11:06,450 --> 00:11:11,433
But then he is so damn good with the kids, so it's like having the world's best babysitter with him.

152
00:11:11,529 --> 00:11:18,750
- Yes.
 All "kids" love Daniel.
 Mister Jumpyard!
 - Mister Jumpyard, yes.
 Just.

153
00:11:59,032 --> 00:12:01,406
So, what an empathy!

154
00:12:02,340 --> 00:12:04,341
This is on life and d*d.

155
00:12:14,349 --> 00:12:17,018
Are you tired, Laura?

156
00:12:17,885 --> 00:12:23,023
Tired and hungry.
 You get to move so much.

157
00:12:23,090 --> 00:12:24,691
Yeah!

158
00:12:24,858 --> 00:12:30,890
- What do you do?
 - We try ... keep up this way.
 Can't you show how to do?

159
00:12:36,534 --> 00:12:39,669
- Get to see again.
 - Now we are tired.

160
00:12:40,080 --> 00:12:41,738
Wow!

161
00:12:43,506 --> 00:12:48,220
- And you are not great on it yet.
 Or?
 - No.
 Yes, actually.

162
00:12:48,410 --> 00:12:49,816
Soon.

163
00:12:49,877 --> 00:12:54,348
So, I think.
 You get to practice a little more, Alma.

164
00:12:55,682 --> 00:13:00,019
- (Daniel) What plan do you have, Harry?
 - I have no plan.

165
00:13:00,086 --> 00:13:04,889
Do you remember last time?
 Then she had a hard time meeting when it was tight, right?

166
00:13:04,956 --> 00:13:08,025
- mm.
 - As tightly build it.

167
00:13:08,359 --> 00:13:11,028
What are you doing, Alma?

168
00:13:12,229 --> 00:13:18,200
We do ... fast.
 Then we will try ...

169
00:13:18,367 --> 00:13:22,603
You should use ten blocks and build a fort.

170
00:13:22,670 --> 00:13:24,872
Or build type a wall.

171
00:13:25,005 --> 00:13:33,078
And then you should try to get the other person down by just throwing like this.

172
00:13:33,145 --> 00:13:36,214
You have to be behind these.

173
00:13:42,520 --> 00:13:45,021
Five.
 Three.

174
00:13:46,192 --> 00:13:49,024
Laura is investing in Valo Jump.

175
00:13:49,091 --> 00:13:54,629
- Put on the TV.
 - You have to stand and jump on the trampoline to get it started, Laura.

176
00:14:00,033 --> 00:14:03,661
Yay!
 I can handle it!

177
00:14:07,310 --> 00:14:09,874
- Are you ready?
 - (all) Yes!

178
00:14:09,941 --> 00:14:12,009
Ready Set Go!

179
00:14:14,011 --> 00:14:15,145
No!

180
00:14:15,412 --> 00:14:17,414
- Yes!
 - "Yes!"

181
00:14:17,480 --> 00:14:18,614
!

182
00:14:18,705 --> 00:14:22,351
- We won!
 Nice work!
 - Good work!

183
00:14:22,490 --> 00:14:28,622
Now he is coming.
 Harry doesn't like to lose!
 Oh oh oh!
 "Watch out, watch out!"
 (Beware!)

184
00:14:28,689 --> 00:14:33,248
Come on, Harry!
 Fight, fight!
 All the way.

185
00:14:34,093 --> 00:14:36,362
All the way!

186
00:14:37,950 --> 00:14:41,724
You're not there yet, we still have one left!

187
00:14:42,396 --> 00:14:44,335
Wooo!

188
00:14:47,004 --> 00:14:51,074
Good, Harry.
 Fight!
 Fight, Harry!

189
00:14:51,140 --> 00:14:53,742
Yayyy!

190
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:47,352
You continue to bounce ... even though we are at the hotel.

191
00:15:48,317 --> 00:15:54,357
- Uaua jump more.
 - Yes, you want to jump more.
 It was so fun on Jumpyard.

192
00:15:54,757 --> 00:15:58,360
- Did you also have fun, Alma?
 - Yes, of course.
 It was super fun.

193
00:15:58,427 --> 00:16:03,164
- Sit down, jumpyard, sleep.
 - Are you going to sleep a little now?

194
00:16:03,231 --> 00:16:10,136
- Jumpyard, sleep.
 - Yes, you need it when you have been up so early and filmed.

195
00:16:10,336 --> 00:16:12,038
We are in our hotel room.

196
00:16:12,405 --> 00:16:17,542
- No, the airplane!
 - No, we're not on the aircraft.

197
00:16:17,609 --> 00:16:22,613
Go the airplane again.
 I want to go Japan.

198
00:16:22,680 --> 00:16:26,549
You want to go to Japan.
 But I think we should drive home later.

199
00:16:26,616 --> 00:16:28,684
But maybe we should show what it looks like here.

200
00:16:28,751 --> 00:16:31,086
- No, don't go home.
 - Yes.

201
00:16:31,181 --> 00:16:34,689
- Nah.
 - You want to stay here and stay at Jumpyard with Daniel?

202
00:16:34,756 --> 00:16:35,556
Yes.

203
00:16:36,040 --> 00:16:38,025
So, here we live.

204
00:16:38,158 --> 00:16:43,296
And here mom, dad, and Laura, sleep in this room.

205
00:16:43,363 --> 00:16:43,896
Mm.

206
00:16:43,963 --> 00:16:48,834
And we have two hotel rooms, so it will be like a double room with this door.

207
00:16:48,900 --> 00:16:51,740
Just that, such a "connecting door" that you can unlock.

208
00:16:51,803 --> 00:16:56,940
- Yes exactly.
 And here I sleep and Harry.
 - Yes.

209
00:16:57,007 --> 00:16:59,100
- And that's kind of it.
 - Yes.

210
00:16:59,142 --> 00:17:02,678
It's pretty small and very messy, but it doesn't matter much.

211
00:17:02,745 --> 00:17:07,548
- No, but we're just here in Madrid on a lightning visit.
 - Yes.

212
00:17:07,615 --> 00:17:10,417
- To test the new park.
 - Yes.

213
00:17:10,484 --> 00:17:15,221
So, it is great that Jumpyard expands abroad.

214
00:17:15,288 --> 00:17:16,889
Spider-Man!

215
00:17:16,956 --> 00:17:18,290
- Come.
 - Spider-Man.

216
00:17:18,357 --> 00:17:20,158
Spider-Man expands abroad.

217
00:17:20,225 --> 00:17:24,228
No, but Jumpyard is a Swedish company.
 I don't think everyone knows about it.

218
00:17:24,295 --> 00:17:25,629
No, actually not.

219
00:17:25,696 --> 00:17:30,433
- And then we go around and we meet Daniel in every park we visit.
 - Yes.

220
00:17:30,500 --> 00:17:32,535
We call him Mister Jumpyard.

221
00:17:32,602 --> 00:17:36,738
So, he is always in place when it opens new parks.

222
00:17:36,805 --> 00:17:43,544
And they are opening new ones in Sweden now and also abroad.
 We have been to Lisbon.
 More...?

223
00:17:43,610 --> 00:17:44,811
And now Madrid.

224
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:46,012
Yes.

225
00:17:46,346 --> 00:17:47,880
Västerås, well.

226
00:17:47,970 --> 00:17:50,883
- Västerås.
 It's fun.
 - And Nacka, many times.

227
00:17:50,949 --> 00:17:52,884
Yes, Nacka we have been many times, in Stockholm.

228
00:17:52,951 --> 00:17:57,555
- Västerås.
 - Västerås.
 Yes.
 We may be allowed to go back there.

229
00:17:57,621 --> 00:18:03,026
- Västerås!
 Go Västerås!
 - She wants to go to Västerås.

230
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:06,028
- But corner.
 - Yes.

231
00:18:06,116 --> 00:18:08,250
- Today's question, I thought.
 - mm.

232
00:18:08,297 --> 00:18:14,390
After all, it became a very natural when we entered Jumpyard this morning.
 Our favorite color.

233
00:18:16,020 --> 00:18:17,804
- Right.
 - Pink.
 Pink.

234
00:18:17,871 --> 00:18:19,700
Yes.
 Pink and pink.

235
00:18:19,739 --> 00:18:23,409
- Green.
 - Green?!
 She said yours was yellow.

236
00:18:23,475 --> 00:18:24,676
- Yes.
 - Right.

237
00:18:24,743 --> 00:18:26,900
Guuul!

238
00:18:27,855 --> 00:18:32,417
- Do you have two?
 - Yes.
 Yellow, gray, and green.

239
00:18:32,482 --> 00:18:35,552
Three.
 Yellow, gray, and green.
 Mine is...

240
00:18:35,618 --> 00:18:38,954
-Yellow-gray-green.
 - God, what you babble all the time.

241
00:18:39,021 --> 00:18:40,689
Pink.

242
00:18:41,023 --> 00:18:45,026
- Mine is red.
 - Like Jumpyard's colors.

243
00:18:45,359 --> 00:18:46,427
And you?

244
00:18:46,840 --> 00:18:50,652
I feel that I answer differently to this question every time.

245
00:18:50,697 --> 00:18:51,497
Yes.

246
00:18:51,564 --> 00:18:56,335
But maybe orange, or orangery.

247
00:18:57,177 --> 00:18:59,671
What is your favorite color?

248
00:18:59,737 --> 00:19:04,675
Comment below!

249
00:19:05,040 --> 00:19:11,280
Thanks for watching this video!

250
00:19:11,413 --> 00:19:15,750
Feel free to leave a thumbs up, or down.

251
00:19:15,817 --> 00:19:17,685
Most thumbs up!

252
00:19:17,885 --> 00:19:21,354
Comment, ask questions and have a great time until we see you next time.

253
00:19:21,421 --> 00:19:24,490
- See you!
 - Bye!
