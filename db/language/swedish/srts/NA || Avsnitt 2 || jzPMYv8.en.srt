1
00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:19.280
Kristina!

2
00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:25.680
Magnus said Frida always makes breakfast on the bed for him.

3
00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:33.360
If you want it, you can sleep in the kitchen.

4
00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:18.520
They are so cozy.
 This is probably because Frida makes breakfast on the bed.

5
00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:27.840
Here...

6
00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:31.600
So.
 Now you have breakfast on the bed.

7
00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:20.360
-What are you doing?
 - You get such a stupid hairstyle when you slept.

8
00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:24.040
Ah ... it doesn't matter!

9
00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:33.240
Now we have problems with the printer on level five again.

10
00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:39.400
Hello!
 I posed a question.

11
00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:47.520
I have no memory that I have said, "Be so good and get on!"

12
00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:55.160
Well, sorry!
 It was not meant to rush in.
 Should I...

13
00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:58.320
... go out again?

14
00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:03.200
I go out again.

15
00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:19.720
I am busy.

16
00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:28.360
Can you send the butter, Kristina?

17
00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:31.640
Kristina!
 Can you send the butter?

18
00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:37.840
Can you send the butter!

19
00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:44.160
Thanks!

20
00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:49.960
- Now we want help with the printer ... - Set yourself in the taped box!

21
00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:55.880
You should stand in it if you want to ask something.

22
00:03:57.880 --> 00:04:01.320
Why?

23
00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:06.480
Maybe because I will not help you otherwise.

24
00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:17.080
You are standing on the tape.

25
00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:38.240
Are you in the collection for Karin?
 It is her birthday.

26
00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:44.520
We were going to buy four orrefors glass, "Serenad".
 She collects them.

27
00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:48.760
- What have the others put?
 â€“20 SEK.

28
00:04:48.920 --> 00:04:52.160
Have they laid so much?

29
00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:56.280
Yes ... it will be fun.

30
00:04:57.640 --> 00:05:01.760
So then.
 I write here.

31
00:05:05.160 --> 00:05:08.160
Or you, by the way ...

32
00:05:11.160 --> 00:05:16.840
I just want to spend SEK 10.
 I don't like Karin.
 Or 5 kr ...

33
00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:20.680
... or actually nothing.

34
00:05:25.120 --> 00:05:33.040
The printer flash at "Stand by".
 We have changed tones and checked the magazine.

35
00:05:34.680 --> 00:05:41.320
When you were little, were you out playing with your friends then?

36
00:05:43.400 --> 00:05:45.400
Yes...

37
00:05:45.560 --> 00:05:49.840
Then did you start training hockey and football?

38
00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:57.440
And then you started running a mop, walking on hip and kissing girls?

39
00:05:58.440 --> 00:06:01.240
Yes, what then?!

40
00:06:02.360 --> 00:06:08.360
Had you been tinkering with computers instead, you would not have been here as an idiot.

41
00:06:12.920 --> 00:06:18.040
Look at him.
 There he sits - stupid like a log!

42
00:06:18.200 --> 00:06:24.640
He has not a wise word he has said, yet he has the same salary as me.

43
00:06:24.800 --> 00:06:28.440
What is it that smells?
 Yes, Paul.

44
00:06:28.600 --> 00:06:33.720
Day in and day in ... His ugliness knows no bounds.

45
00:06:33.880 --> 00:06:38.040
Like a surveillance plum ...

46
00:06:38.200 --> 00:06:44.440
- Is it okay if I turn off?
 - No, I want to listen.

47
00:06:44.600 --> 00:06:48.280
What is the fucking hairstyle?

48
00:07:03.480 --> 00:07:09.400
God, Peter!
 Check out such mini tomatoes!
 God, what they are cute!

49
00:07:10.640 --> 00:07:16.640
When I look like this, I get such a desire to have children!

50
00:07:24.240 --> 00:07:29.240
-How are you?
 - I feel low.

51
00:07:29.400 --> 00:07:34.960
It was a heavy day at work.
 I've got a new colleague ...

52
00:07:35.120 --> 00:07:41.840
We can focus on shopping now?
 Don't walk around and feel all the time!

53
00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:45.040
What then feels?

54
00:07:45.200 --> 00:07:50.560
First you are happy, then you are sad.
 We're going to shop now.

55
00:07:50.720 --> 00:07:55.760
- Yes, but now I feel ... - precise there!

56
00:07:55.920 --> 00:08:01.800
Now you get so aggressive.
 It is completely unsustainable!

57
00:08:07.920 --> 00:08:13.400
- I want the jam!
 - Now you changed the feeling again.
 Typical.

58
00:08:16.160 --> 00:08:22.360
We put you in the wagon and I'll drive around with you.
 Then it goes faster.

59
00:08:33.040 --> 00:08:37.240
This feels very pleased.

60
00:08:39.600 --> 00:08:41.640
So.

61
00:08:42.880 --> 00:08:49.080
You are employed to help us!
 The printer bastard does not work!

62
00:08:49.240 --> 00:08:54.240
- That where the error we know.
 - Make something, then!

63
00:08:54.400 --> 00:08:59.560
- It should not happen.
 - Should it be so impossible?!

64
00:08:59.720 --> 00:09:04.200
It is not impossible.
 I know how to do it.

65
00:09:04.360 --> 00:09:09.160
- Be so damn busy and do it, then!
 -No...

66
00:09:09.320 --> 00:09:14.480
... I think you have a very unpleasant tone.

67
00:09:14.640 --> 00:09:17.640
I am in a hurry!

68
00:09:17.800 --> 00:09:23.040
Okay.
 Stand in the box and sing "You are the only one".

69
00:09:24.040 --> 00:09:27.120
Come on now, for hell ...

70
00:09:28.440 --> 00:09:31.960
I will not help you otherwise.

71
00:09:33.760 --> 00:09:37.520
Please.
 Can't you help me?

72
00:09:41.560 --> 00:09:45.360
I'm sitting here waiting for a song.

73
00:09:53.360 --> 00:09:56.600
You are the only one...

74
00:10:01.680 --> 00:10:04.680
Are you sorry, the old man?

75
00:10:04.840 --> 00:10:11.840
Is it because you have no girl or because you are so narrow?

76
00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:16.200
your mouth, your eyes your soothing voice

77
00:10:16.360 --> 00:10:18.720
and that's why i beg you now

78
00:10:18.880 --> 00:10:24.680
mere you give me a single little word I am yours

79
00:10:28.240 --> 00:10:33.480
Do you remember "I Will Always Love You" with Whitney Houston?

80
00:10:33.640 --> 00:10:36.720
It was a long time since you heard.

81
00:10:38.920 --> 00:10:42.800
I can't cope this.
 Take it you!

82
00:10:45.440 --> 00:10:48.880
You can lift now.
 Test once!

83
00:10:49.040 --> 00:10:52.240
You, it's already noticeable.

84
00:10:52.400 --> 00:10:57.440
God, how nice!
 I almost fall asleep up here.

85
00:11:12.400 --> 00:11:18.160
You do a damn good job.
 I admire you.

86
00:11:19.280 --> 00:11:26.520
I feel I can learn a lot from you.
 You are so sharp ...

87
00:11:26.680 --> 00:11:31.160
You are a role model.
 Good.
 Hello.

88
00:11:32.560 --> 00:11:37.560
-Excuse me.
 Where were we?
 - You said I was an idiot.

89
00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:50.000
Phone signal

90
00:11:52.320 --> 00:11:55.320
Who could it be?

91
00:11:56.440 --> 00:12:00.000
Yes, hello.
 It's Gun.
 Huh?

92
00:12:00.160 --> 00:12:05.720
If I can answer any questions?
 Who is asking?

93
00:12:05.880 --> 00:12:12.640
Bear?
 It was a Grant Name!
 A real BamsebjÃ¶rn ...

94
00:12:12.800 --> 00:12:19.040
Yes ... huh?
 If I want to subscribe to Svenska Dagbladet?

95
00:12:19.200 --> 00:12:24.720
You ... can you ask a counter -question, bear?

96
00:12:24.880 --> 00:12:28.440
Do you know what I am wearing right now?

97
00:12:28.600 --> 00:12:32.480
No.
 I'm purely naked, bear.

98
00:12:32.640 --> 00:12:38.000
Yes it's me.
 Just as God has created me.

99
00:12:39.240 --> 00:12:42.760
What did you say?
 Introductory offer?

100
00:12:42.920 --> 00:12:50.200
If you pallet you here, you should get an introduction that you should not forget!

101
00:12:50.360 --> 00:12:57.320
Yes ... do you know what I do while we talk about Svenska Dagbladet?

102
00:12:58.440 --> 00:13:04.600
I play with myself.
 I'm like an amusement park!

103
00:13:04.760 --> 00:13:09.520
Come and go the jumping sofa with me!

104
00:13:09.680 --> 00:13:13.640
Hello!
 Bear?

105
00:13:13.800 --> 00:13:17.680
And I

106
00:13:17.840 --> 00:13:22.080
will always love you

107
00:13:22.240 --> 00:13:25.600
and I will always

108
00:13:25.760 --> 00:13:28.600
Love

109
00:13:28.760 --> 00:13:31.240
You

110
00:13:33.040 --> 00:13:40.600
Fairly good.
 Take it again where you really mean what you sing!

111
00:14:01.960 --> 00:14:07.920
Hi, my name is Gunnar.
 Welcome to this Pantomim Course!

112
00:14:08.080 --> 00:14:16.200
You have been commissioned to prepare each Pantomim.
 We start with that.

113
00:14:16.360 --> 00:14:21.360
What's your name?
 Jasmine?
 Can you mima for us?

114
00:14:29.360 --> 00:14:33.440
Oh, what it blows today.
 Full headwind.

115
00:14:33.600 --> 00:14:37.360
It's hard to go when it blows.

116
00:14:37.520 --> 00:14:39.960
Thanks.

117
00:14:40.120 --> 00:14:45.680
Great!
 You have nice motor skills, nice and soft movements.

118
00:14:45.840 --> 00:14:52.480
Now you talked while you mimicked.
 Can you try again and be quiet?

119
00:14:53.480 --> 00:14:55.840
You are welcome.

120
00:14:59.560 --> 00:15:02.160
Sch ...

121
00:15:04.200 --> 00:15:08.760
Jasmine!
 Try to be completely silent.

122
00:15:16.520 --> 00:15:20.880
Oh, what it blows.
 It's full storm.

123
00:15:22.440 --> 00:15:28.320
Good.
 Great ... But now you talked again.
 Did you notice that?

124
00:15:28.480 --> 00:15:33.440
It becomes clearer if you talk.

125
00:15:34.440 --> 00:15:40.320
Yes, but Pantomim means being able to express something without words.

126
00:15:40.480 --> 00:15:43.960
But that was good.

127
00:15:45.320 --> 00:15:49.480
Okay.
 Here we have the next pantomimics.

128
00:15:50.680 --> 00:15:53.680
The scene is yours.

129
00:15:58.840 --> 00:16:01.560
You are welcome.

130
00:16:07.520 --> 00:16:11.800
Thanks.
 A minimalist mim ...

131
00:16:13.880 --> 00:16:19.240
- What did it imagine?
 - I queued for the Social Insurance Office.

132
00:16:19.400 --> 00:16:23.720
Well.
 Good!
 - Jasmine?

133
00:16:23.880 --> 00:16:28.760
They would have understood better if he talked.

134
00:17:13.200 --> 00:17:17.240
-Yes?
 - It seems to be wrong with the mailbox.

135
00:17:17.400 --> 00:17:24.200
- Is it wrong with the mailbox?
 - Yes, I tried to get in ... the post.

136
00:17:24.360 --> 00:17:31.120
You ... what could be wrong then?
 Come in!
 You see nothing in the stairs.

137
00:17:33.360 --> 00:17:36.880
Can't you see what happened?

138
00:17:37.040 --> 00:17:42.280
It seems to be okay.
 Now I'll move on.

139
00:17:42.440 --> 00:17:49.120
- Don't you borrow a toilet?
 -No thanks.
 Thanks anyway.

140
00:17:49.280 --> 00:17:54.360
You don't get out.
 It is wrong with the lock.

141
00:17:54.520 --> 00:18:00.720
- But it worked just recently.
 - Yes, but now it's wrong.

142
00:18:03.360 --> 00:18:08.720
Ouch!
 I got a shock.
 There is power in the handle.

143
00:18:08.880 --> 00:18:12.960
Yes ... I faint!

144
00:18:13.120 --> 00:18:17.280
Hold me!
 Help Help!

145
00:18:17.440 --> 00:18:20.120
So yes.

146
00:18:20.280 --> 00:18:24.240
Well, so yes.
 Now we're talking.

147
00:18:25.560 --> 00:18:29.000
What the hell!
 You are sick!

148
00:18:29.160 --> 00:18:32.440
Hello!
 I will report you!

149
00:18:33.440 --> 00:18:36.760
Post ... you took my post.

150
00:18:40.880 --> 00:18:45.000
Oh, now it would taste good with juice.

151
00:18:49.720 --> 00:18:53.040
Oh, it was good!

152
00:18:57.240 --> 00:18:59.960
Good...

153
00:19:00.120 --> 00:19:05.160
... though now you talked and so you used props.

154
00:19:05.320 --> 00:19:10.320
It gets a little more luxurious then, and not just pretending.

155
00:19:10.480 --> 00:19:14.560
- Jasmine?
 - It was both clear and good.

156
00:19:16.920 --> 00:19:19.920
We end there for today.

157
00:19:27.480 --> 00:19:34.120
Kristina!
 Can you pick up a pair of bigger pants?
 These were too tight.

158
00:19:35.400 --> 00:19:42.720
Kristina!
 A pair of regular jeans.
 Size 34 may work.
 Okay.

159
00:21:21.720 --> 00:21:29.480
Are you angry still?
 Kristina is fat!
 A little fat, Kristina?

160
00:21:32.440 --> 00:21:37.560
Kristina is fat.
 Look, Kristina!

161
00:21:49.960 --> 00:21:57.360
What a wonderful meal!
 You're not only beautiful - you can cook too.

162
00:21:57.520 --> 00:22:01.480
Should I put on something more comfortable?

163
00:22:03.400 --> 00:22:06.440
By all means.

164
00:22:21.920 --> 00:22:24.200
FART!

165
00:22:34.240 --> 00:22:40.120
When we meet the others tomorrow ... We celebrate our anniversary.

166
00:22:40.280 --> 00:22:47.400
- Do you remember how we met?
 - Yes, we met at the Sollentuna Fair.

167
00:22:47.560 --> 00:22:54.120
- We drank coffee together in the dining room.
 - Yes, and it doesn't hold.

168
00:22:54.280 --> 00:22:59.800
It is the world's worst history.
 It's not even a story.

169
00:22:59.960 --> 00:23:02.960
No, but that's the truth.

170
00:23:03.120 --> 00:23:08.560
If someone asks, we say we met in Venice.

171
00:23:08.720 --> 00:23:11.000
Venice?

172
00:23:12.000 --> 00:23:18.080
I have left my boyfriend.
 I get lost and you help me.

173
00:23:18.240 --> 00:23:25.320
We go gondola, you let me off.
 You have fallen blindly in love with me.

174
00:23:25.480 --> 00:23:28.480
You are looking through Venice's all hotels.

175
00:23:28.640 --> 00:23:35.480
When you find me you climb up the balcony, and there we kiss each other.

176
00:23:36.960 --> 00:23:40.320
"Shit, french fries"!
 You're joking?

177
00:23:42.200 --> 00:23:49.160
-Not?
 They will never believe us.
 - Yes.
 Only we say the same thing.

178
00:23:49.320 --> 00:23:55.240
- I never remember that.
 - I have written it down for you.

179
00:23:55.400 --> 00:24:00.880
- It's a whole book.
 - I have filled with some details.

180
00:24:01.880 --> 00:24:06.880
Plug on it, so I hear you tomorrow.

181
00:24:30.400 --> 00:24:36.560
Then we went through an alley with a bookstore and came to Marcusplatsen.

182
00:24:37.560 --> 00:24:40.960
There, my hand touched at yours.

183
00:24:41.720 --> 00:24:44.720
And then ... No, I don't remember.

184
00:24:44.880 --> 00:24:52.240
Get it together!
 We came to an alley with a bookstore.
 There you took my hand.

185
00:24:53.640 --> 00:24:57.600
How did you perceive me in the gondola?

186
00:24:58.840 --> 00:25:03.240
I perceived you as spontaneous and ...

187
00:25:04.240 --> 00:25:07.760
-...soft.
 - Warm, Magnus!

188
00:25:07.920 --> 00:25:11.040
Should it be so damn hard?!

189
00:25:24.320 --> 00:25:30.200
I think Magnus smells like a summer evening after a rain.

190
00:25:30.360 --> 00:25:34.440
God, what a nice thing!

191
00:25:34.600 --> 00:25:42.640
My new guy smells just like a bouquet of dewy lilies!

192
00:25:42.800 --> 00:25:47.240
-Oh!
 -I know.
 It is absolutely wonderful.

193
00:25:48.520 --> 00:25:53.040
Ulf, he smells a bit like ...

194
00:25:54.040 --> 00:25:57.040
...boiled rice.

195
00:26:00.520 --> 00:26:03.280
Stick -free.

196
00:26:08.480 --> 00:26:14.440
- You've been together for so long!
 - Time goes by fast when you have fun.

197
00:26:16.440 --> 00:26:19.640
How did you really meet two?

198
00:26:20.640 --> 00:26:24.240
Magnus, you can tell you!

199
00:26:24.400 --> 00:26:27.520
It's a pretty funny story.

200
00:26:30.400 --> 00:26:35.160
- We met in Venice.
 - God, what romantic!

201
00:26:36.840 --> 00:26:40.960
It was in April.
 Spring had made its mind.

202
00:26:41.120 --> 00:26:46.160
The sun's rays danced over the old house facades.

203
00:26:46.320 --> 00:26:51.640
I drove planlessly around the old alleys -

204
00:26:51.800 --> 00:26:57.840
- Driven by curiosity but also by a diff ... US longing.

205
00:26:58.000 --> 00:27:02.120
I didn't think I would meet ...

206
00:27:07.800 --> 00:27:10.800
...the love of my life.

207
00:27:39.960 --> 00:27:42.960

208
00:27:47.480 --> 00:27:50.200
Good night, Kristina.

209
00:27:52.000 --> 00:27:54.320
Good night.

210
00:27:58.040 --> 00:28:00.760
Good night.
