00:00:03.072 --> 00:00:04.352
Hello my name is Mia.

2
00:00:04.608 --> 00:00:06.843
I work at the Academic Writing Center

3
00:00:06.843 --> 00:00:08.448
at Ã–rebro University Library.

4
00:00:09.472 --> 00:00:11.766
In this movie I show how to do

5
00:00:11.766 --> 00:00:16.220
Point exhibitions in academic texts.

6
00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:21.500
It is quite common for us to make some point lists everyday.

7
00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:26.040
In academic texts, we also make point lineups.

8
00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:29.180
It may be for slightly different reasons

9
00:00:29.440 --> 00:00:32.512
but above all if you want to do things clear-

10
00:00:32.768 --> 00:00:35.262
 or when you want to highlight specific things-

11
00:00:35.262 --> 00:00:37.120
Or when you want to clarify things.

12
00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:40.080
But when should you make setups

13
00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:44.040
And not reproduce the information in your body text?

14
00:00:44.288 --> 00:00:47.862
There are some guidelines to follow.

15
00:00:47.862 --> 00:00:49.408
They look like this:

16
00:00:50.176 --> 00:00:54.272
 When you want to emphasize some information.

17
00:00:54.528 --> 00:00:57.600
 When a sentence contains long enumerations.

18
00:00:57.856 --> 00:01:01.952
 When you want to explain or sort out complicated facts.

19
00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:06.816
All this is about facilitating reading.

20
00:01:07.584 --> 00:01:13.728
If you need to make a point lineup, there are guidelines to follow.

21
00:01:14.496 --> 00:01:19.360
You have to be careful about how to construct your joints in your set up.

22
00:01:19.616 --> 00:01:24.224
You should construct them similarly in both form and content.

23
00:01:24.992 --> 00:01:29.088
You can formulate your points in slightly different ways.

24
00:01:29.344 --> 00:01:34.208
For example, your joints may be focused on words or phrase

25
00:01:35.232 --> 00:01:36.512
 on a sent-

26
00:01:36.768 --> 00:01:38.560
or one or more sentences.

27
00:01:38.816 --> 00:01:40.352
It depends on what they have for purpose

28
00:01:40.608 --> 00:01:42.656
in terms of content with your point lineup.

29
00:01:42.912 --> 00:01:43.680
But...

30
00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:47.540
You must be careful not to mix the way you write your joints.

31
00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:49.700
Namely

32
00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:53.260
You must not mix individual words with complete sentences.

33
00:01:53.540 --> 00:01:54.680
You choose a way

34
00:01:54.944 --> 00:01:58.016
to formulate yourself in your set -up.

35
00:01:58.784 --> 00:02:02.368
If you are going to make a point lineup with short joints

36
00:02:02.624 --> 00:02:05.184
Has each joint lowercase.

37
00:02:05.696 --> 00:02:06.976
It may look like this.

38
00:02:07.232 --> 00:02:09.792
"In the first place you can seek answers by"

39
00:02:10.304 --> 00:02:14.656
"Read your course literature, visit your nearest library, talk to a student friend."

40
00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:17.984
And you see that there are no commas.

41
00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:22.592
We do not use "and" or "as well as" and the point comes at the end.

42
00:02:23.616 --> 00:02:28.402
Should you use a point set up with complete sentences in each joint

43
00:02:28.402 --> 00:02:32.180
Then each joint must have a capital letter and end with a point.

44
00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:34.120
Then it may look like this

45
00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:39.140
Each joint has a uppercase and it ends with a point.

46
00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:44.340
You should clearly mark in your text that you have made a point lineup.

47
00:02:44.864 --> 00:02:48.577
Do you do this by having shiny above and below

48
00:02:48.577 --> 00:02:51.008
And your point lineup has indentation.

49
00:02:51.264 --> 00:02:53.824
Then it differs from the other text.

50
00:02:55.872 --> 00:02:56.896
Then the question is ...

51
00:02:57.152 --> 00:02:58.944
Should you use colon

52
00:02:59.200 --> 00:02:59.968
Or not

53
00:03:00.736 --> 00:03:04.064
So, should it look like this, or should it look like this

54
00:03:04.832 --> 00:03:07.904
It is your meaning structure that determines.

55
00:03:08.672 --> 00:03:11.159
Have you created a meaning structure

56
00:03:11.159 --> 00:03:13.956
which is a linguistic independent batch.

57
00:03:13.956 --> 00:03:14.816
Then it will be with a colon.

58
00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:17.220
But is it not an independent batch

59
00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:18.840
it will not be the colon.

60
00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:24.600
It depends on how you have built up your meaning structure.

61
00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:28.640
Your joints can be marked in slightly different ways.

62
00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:37.520
You can use point, tank line, letters (common) or numbers.

63
00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:41.340
When you write with numbers it may look like this.

64
00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:43.560
You have 1.2 and 3 and always a point after.

65
00:03:43.740 --> 00:03:46.560
Letters have a final bracket behind it.

66
00:03:47.320 --> 00:03:51.920
Would you like to refer to your point lineup further in your body text

67
00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:57.580
Then 1, 2 and 3, or A, B and C are best to use.

68
00:03:57.920 --> 00:04:00.400
It is not possible to refer back to point or tank line.

69
00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:03.580
Would you like to comment on your points

70
00:04:03.880 --> 00:04:06.900
Do you use any of these.

71
00:04:07.300 --> 00:04:09.600
You can also use both of these.

72
00:04:09.856 --> 00:04:12.928
For example, if you have a first joint with numbers

73
00:04:13.184 --> 00:04:15.488
and wants to during e.g.
 the third-

74
00:04:15.740 --> 00:04:20.180
Also, say that there are more points, below a specific point.

75
00:04:20.600 --> 00:04:25.780
Then you can mix numbers and common letters.

76
00:04:27.780 --> 00:04:32.840
You can refer to both numbers or letters further in your text

77
00:04:33.160 --> 00:04:35.980
If you want to comment on what is in the point lineup.

78
00:04:38.015 --> 00:04:38.783
So...

79
00:04:39.295 --> 00:04:41.855
Consider when using point set up.

80
00:04:42.623 --> 00:04:45.183
Make sure you are constructing similarly.

81
00:04:45.951 --> 00:04:48.767
Formalia and punctuation you must follow

82
00:04:49.023 --> 00:04:50.559
So as I went through in this movie.

83
00:04:51.327 --> 00:04:56.447
Make sure to use point set up to increase readability in your text.

84
00:04:57.727 --> 00:04:59.775
So have you made point lineups

85
00:05:00.031 --> 00:05:02.335
Look how they look.

86
00:05:02.591 --> 00:05:05.151
Fix what may need to be addressed.

87
00:05:06.175 --> 00:05:08.223
With that I have to thank you so much for me

88
00:05:08.480 --> 00:05:12.540
So I wish you good luck with your academic writing.

89
00:05:13.080 --> 00:05:13.860
bye
