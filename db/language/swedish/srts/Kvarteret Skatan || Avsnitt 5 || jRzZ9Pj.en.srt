1
00:00:07.360 --> 00:00:13.840
I want a reporting of all the steps in the process.

2
00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:21.040
The overall goal of the project is a pleasant indoor environment.

3
00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:24.320
We will look at the organization ...

4
00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:29.160
- Can't we just clean up?
 -Okay.

5
00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:04.600
The whole phone shakes.

6
00:02:08.040 --> 00:02:13.320
- Sometimes my hands shake my hands too.
 -SMS.

7
00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:19.080
I worked as a plumbing installer.

8
00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:25.360
It didn't smell roses, directly, when working ...

9
00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:34.440
We have known a need, obtained information and made a purchase decision.

10
00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:39.760
We arrive at negotiating discounts.

11
00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:47.800
- Do you or not?!
 - I can imagine a discount ...

12
00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:08.480
- Night, Kennet!
 -Hello Jenny!
 Now I am here!

13
00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:14.600
- What are you doing in town?
 - We are 30 years now.

14
00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:18.160
- Yeah ...?
 - The valley!

15
00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:24.400
We made a deal: If we were both singles at 30, we would get married.

16
00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:31.920
- Don't you in Skåne?
 - Yes, so I have no job here.

17
00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:37.240
We can live on your salary.
 Which side are you sleeping on?

18
00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:44.920
That was not serious.
 We were seventeen years old and very nice.

19
00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:50.000
Don't you intend to stand for your part of the deal?

20
00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:54.840
No, Kennet.
 I won't.

21
00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:58.480
Then I feel pretty stupid.

22
00:03:58.640 --> 00:04:03.840
Maybe I should have tried to date someone in the last 13 years?

23
00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:09.440
Yes, you might have done it.
 I'm sorry, Kennet.

24
00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:15.440
Shall we say 40?
 What do you think about that?

25
00:04:29.640 --> 00:04:35.280
I think I have become so thick.
 I feel so plump!

26
00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:41.640
- No, it's just in your head.
 - stress can take physical expression.

27
00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:45.800
That's probably why I feel bad.

28
00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:50.840
It is burnout.
 You have stressed too much.

29
00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:57.440
This is certainly why I have not had menstruation in eight months.

30
00:04:57.600 --> 00:05:03.200
- You should go to a psychologist.
 - Yes, you get a little fun.

31
00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:06.400
Can we get two beers here!

32
00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:12.400
That could be gases.
 You haven't tried Samarin?

33
00:05:24.480 --> 00:05:29.680
-How is it?
 You seem a little sad.
 -What is it?

34
00:05:31.040 --> 00:05:34.200
- It's Magnus.
 - Should you move apart?

35
00:05:34.360 --> 00:05:39.040
No no.
 But he has become so thick!

36
00:05:39.200 --> 00:05:45.280
- He exercises well and eats useful?
 - But at night he jaws sandwiches.

37
00:05:46.920 --> 00:05:51.920
Yes, they do it ... you have to scare him!

38
00:05:52.080 --> 00:05:56.800
- You Ulf is skirting.
 -Right.

39
00:05:56.960 --> 00:06:01.040
I talk about cholesterol and blood fats ...

40
00:06:01.200 --> 00:06:08.840
You have to scare him properly.
 I'll help you, Frida.

41
00:06:14.720 --> 00:06:18.480
I can not sleep.
 I take a sandwich.

42
00:06:18.640 --> 00:06:24.200
- You should not eat at night.
 - Do you start getting thick?

43
00:06:24.360 --> 00:06:30.840
No ... but it's dangerous.
 Think of blood fats and heart.

44
00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:36.480
- You can actually die!
 - Of a night sandwich?
 Get it together.

45
00:06:50.240 --> 00:06:54.040
Is it to me?
 Thanks!

46
00:07:00.920 --> 00:07:07.280
Hope you sleep well tonight.
 I bought ergonomic pillows.

47
00:07:08.160 --> 00:07:14.520
-Good.
 The old ones were so incredibly soft.
 - These are very hard.

48
00:07:14.680 --> 00:07:17.800
Knak!

49
00:07:14.680 --> 00:07:17.800
Ouch...

50
00:07:18.800 --> 00:07:23.040
It is then high time for penetration.

51
00:07:23.200 --> 00:07:27.400
This is followed by a rhythmically offensive ...

52
00:07:27.560 --> 00:07:30.600
... leading up to the final.

53
00:08:15.240 --> 00:08:20.880
- You wanted to talk to me ...?
 - Ove says you harass him.

54
00:08:21.040 --> 00:08:27.760
Ove Lindgren claims that you have said derogatory things about him.

55
00:08:27.920 --> 00:08:32.920
This morning, when he entered the meeting room, you should have said:

56
00:08:33.080 --> 00:08:38.840
"Cut together, guys, because here comes the butt."

57
00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:42.400
I haven't said that.
 It's a lie.

58
00:08:42.560 --> 00:08:47.520
We do not have to do people's sexual orientation.

59
00:08:47.680 --> 00:08:53.040
No, I would never ... I didn't even know that Ove was a tail boy ...

60
00:08:53.200 --> 00:08:58.040
–Yes - aft shooter.
 He takes it in ... - thanks, that's enough!

61
00:08:58.200 --> 00:09:02.000
Ulf ... I pull a line over this -

62
00:09:02.160 --> 00:09:07.160
- But I hear more accusations I have to take action.

63
00:09:07.320 --> 00:09:12.360
I understand that.
 And I hear something I report to you.

64
00:09:12.520 --> 00:09:18.240
Often this is about people being afraid of what is different.

65
00:09:18.400 --> 00:09:24.480
There is nothing to be afraid of.
 As I told Ove thiswater:

66
00:09:24.640 --> 00:09:30.640
"Just because we work together, we're not going to shower together."
 Right?

67
00:09:31.400 --> 00:09:34.240
Welcome to Mansforum!

68
00:09:34.400 --> 00:09:39.320
What do you prefer to do when you get home after the knee?

69
00:09:39.480 --> 00:09:43.160
Beats me down with a whiskey.

70
00:09:43.320 --> 00:09:49.800
Typically us men!
 We love whiskey!
 We will learn more about this noble drink.

71
00:09:49.960 --> 00:09:54.040
Here we have a few different whiskey varieties.

72
00:09:54.200 --> 00:10:00.520
We will get to know the difference between Scottish whiskey, which is made by barley -

73
00:10:00.680 --> 00:10:04.280
–And Bourbon, made by corn.

74
00:10:04.440 --> 00:10:08.600
Lagavulin, a classic whiskey.

75
00:10:10.560 --> 00:10:13.720
Or, as the shots say: Whizzky.

76
00:10:13.880 --> 00:10:19.080
"Whiskey" is Gaelian and means "the water of life".

77
00:10:25.080 --> 00:10:27.080
OOOH!

78
00:10:31.600 --> 00:10:35.840
-OOOH ... - How strong is this really?

79
00:10:36.960 --> 00:10:41.080
–40 percent?!
 - It's deadly!

80
00:10:43.800 --> 00:10:47.320
We might be spinning in our heads!

81
00:10:47.480 --> 00:10:52.760
-Come on now.
 - We will try a bourbon as well.

82
00:10:59.080 --> 00:11:02.520
Honey, what should we eat tonight?

83
00:11:02.680 --> 00:11:05.240
Surprise me.

84
00:11:07.720 --> 00:11:10.200
BUH!

85
00:11:10.360 --> 00:11:13.000
- Overcurred?
 -Yes...

86
00:11:24.320 --> 00:11:30.680
So this was a bourbon.
 It is an American brand -

87
00:11:30.840 --> 00:11:34.880
- And it's called ... I look twice.

88
00:11:36.480 --> 00:11:39.760
Jack Daniels!

89
00:11:59.520 --> 00:12:06.440
You are out patrolling.
 Then a gypsy comes on a moped.
 What are you doing?

90
00:12:06.600 --> 00:12:10.240
-Nothing.
 -Nothing?

91
00:12:10.400 --> 00:12:14.480
No, no crime has been committed.

92
00:12:14.640 --> 00:12:21.160
You see an aunt.
 Against her comes a gypsy on a moped.
 What are you doing?

93
00:12:21.320 --> 00:12:26.400
- Where do you want to come?
 - You take in the gypsy, of course!

94
00:12:26.560 --> 00:12:30.680
He intends to take the aunt's bag!

95
00:12:32.560 --> 00:12:39.080
- You have to teach you the language of the street.
 - See like this then, you who know everything ...

96
00:12:39.240 --> 00:12:44.960
You infiltrate a messy that is exposed to shooting.

97
00:12:45.600 --> 00:12:49.720
In the battle, a civilian is injured.

98
00:12:49.880 --> 00:12:56.000
If you save his life, you clear your cover.
 What are you doing then?

99
00:12:56.160 --> 00:13:02.120
I take the gypsy on a moped.
 It was guaranteed him who shot.

100
00:13:06.800 --> 00:13:08.840
Amateur...!

101
00:13:09.200 --> 00:13:12.320
Cohabitant, a small village before street

102
00:13:12.480 --> 00:13:15.960
It is not far from Rio de la Plata

103
00:13:16.120 --> 00:13:19.000
Almost at the edge of the blue Atlantic

104
00:13:19.160 --> 00:13:23.480
and with pampas behind themselves many hundreds of green miles

105
00:13:23.640 --> 00:13:28.920
There I came riding an evening in April because I wanted to dance tango

106
00:13:49.600 --> 00:13:54.640
- You would come three hours ago.
 - It's such traffic ...

107
00:13:54.800 --> 00:13:59.000
Shit the same.
 Now it is very hurry.

108
00:13:59.160 --> 00:14:04.560
Take this drawing to Abro Architects on Rosenlundsgatan 24.

109
00:14:04.720 --> 00:14:07.840
- Port code?
 –2586.

110
00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:14.160
And this video band is going to Hans Rosenkvist on Päronvägen 2B.

111
00:14:14.680 --> 00:14:19.080
-Lasse!
 You should be on Kungsgatan!
 -Ready for delivery.

112
00:14:19.240 --> 00:14:23.680
- The drawing to Rosenkvistvägen ... –rosenlundsgatan.

113
00:14:23.840 --> 00:14:28.120
–Rosenlundsgatan 34 ... –24.

114
00:14:28.280 --> 00:14:34.320
- The band is going to Hans Päronkvist ... - his Rosenkvist on Päronvägen.

115
00:14:34.480 --> 00:14:42.040
- The port code on Päronvägen is 2438. - No, 2586 - on Rosenlundsgatan!

116
00:14:42.200 --> 00:14:47.320
- No port code is needed on the pear road.
 –Rosengren has no port code?

117
00:14:47.480 --> 00:14:51.280
–Rosenkvist.
 - I and name ... okay.

118
00:14:51.440 --> 00:14:57.680
Then I take the band to the architects on Päronvägen and the drawings for ...

119
00:14:57.840 --> 00:15:03.560
No no no.
 You take the band to Hans on Päronvägen ...

120
00:15:03.720 --> 00:15:09.880
Forget the band and concentrate on the drawing, which is going to ...

121
00:15:10.040 --> 00:15:15.520
- The road.
 - Kvastvägen?!
 Rosenlundsgatan 24!

122
00:15:15.680 --> 00:15:18.320
- Port code?
 –2586!

123
00:15:18.480 --> 00:15:22.240
You should be on Kungsgatan!
 Where are you?!

124
00:15:22.400 --> 00:15:26.920
–Okay, then I stick.
 -Hello!

125
00:15:27.080 --> 00:15:32.600
I would forget my head if it wasn't stuck!
 I'm out.

126
00:15:32.760 --> 00:15:36.640
–Rosenlundsgatan 24!
 -Top.

127
00:15:47.920 --> 00:15:51.840
It was this morning.

128
00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:57.280
Should we go to the sausage booth and have some lunch?

129
00:15:57.440 --> 00:16:04.960
- You get so stubborn by all the fast food.
 -Fast food?
 After all, we are pizza too.

130
00:16:05.120 --> 00:16:10.400
- It takes over 10 minutes.
 - We will eat Asian today.

131
00:16:10.560 --> 00:16:13.920
Asian?
 No no!

132
00:16:14.080 --> 00:16:21.640
- I want to order a yakiniku ... –Jacki ...?
 No no!
 Put down the handset.

133
00:16:21.800 --> 00:16:27.000
- We can take everything on.
 - Put down the handset!

134
00:16:27.160 --> 00:16:33.120
Put down the handset, I say!
 Give damn in order Asian!

135
00:16:33.280 --> 00:16:40.160
Jackinicku ... This is the last time you order that shit for me.

136
00:16:40.320 --> 00:16:46.800
-Roger?
 Now we drive to the sausage.
 - You are not wise.

137
00:16:46.960 --> 00:16:53.880
You're crazy!
 Chinese with piss on the fingers rolling the route fish ...

138
00:16:58.480 --> 00:17:01.040
Wait.

139
00:17:17.760 --> 00:17:24.880
Mom had some gingerbread left.
 "Mother Anna's" - her favorite place.

140
00:17:30.040 --> 00:17:33.440
The funeral ...

141
00:17:34.720 --> 00:17:38.080
I have some papers from Fonus -

142
00:17:38.240 --> 00:17:44.160
- And a letter from the white archive, where mom expresses her wishes.

143
00:17:45.200 --> 00:17:51.160
I had a long conversation with my mom where she said how she wanted it.

144
00:17:53.160 --> 00:17:57.480
I have found a marble tombstone.

145
00:17:57.640 --> 00:18:02.160
-It is nice.
 - I love marble.

146
00:18:02.320 --> 00:18:06.200
Hope!
 It was expensive.

147
00:18:07.720 --> 00:18:15.360
- Mom wasn't a marble type?
 - No, it's so heavy and clumsy.

148
00:18:15.520 --> 00:18:21.360
- Mom was not heavy and clumsy.
 - No, she wasn't.

149
00:18:21.520 --> 00:18:28.600
My son Jörgen could make a simple, slender wooden cross in the craft.

150
00:18:28.760 --> 00:18:34.080
-Yes!
 - Think, what a happy mom would have been!

151
00:18:35.360 --> 00:18:40.480
Don't you think mom is worth more than a wooden cross?

152
00:18:47.680 --> 00:18:54.920
Kista, then ... I've found a white coffin.
 Mom liked white.

153
00:18:57.400 --> 00:19:04.680
Oh, it was fancy.
 Mom wasn't that much for fancy things?

154
00:19:04.840 --> 00:19:07.880
She liked the simple more.

155
00:19:08.040 --> 00:19:14.320
Mom read a lot.
 Maybe you should make a coffin in paper?

156
00:19:15.720 --> 00:19:20.680
There are fantastic nice chests in corrugated cardboard.

157
00:19:20.840 --> 00:19:23.520
Mom loved corrugated cardboard.

158
00:20:01.040 --> 00:20:04.920
- Paul!
 Please stop.
 -Sorry.

159
00:20:08.600 --> 00:20:11.760
Hm, hm ... hee, hee ...

160
00:20:15.520 --> 00:20:21.240
Paul!
 I have to finish this today.

161
00:20:21.760 --> 00:20:24.120
Sorry.

162
00:20:35.840 --> 00:20:38.520
Paul ... Paul!

163
00:20:48.440 --> 00:20:54.240
I don't want to put my mom in a cardboard box.
 If it's about money ...

164
00:20:54.400 --> 00:20:58.680
This is not about money!

165
00:21:01.560 --> 00:21:07.920
In the white archive, Mom expresses a desire to be cremated after her death.

166
00:21:10.120 --> 00:21:15.880
- The corrugated cardboard coffin is burned up ...?
 - It's unnecessary?

167
00:21:16.040 --> 00:21:21.240
- Does the cremation cost something?
 -Yes it does.

168
00:21:23.400 --> 00:21:27.280
- Ingrid, you have a compost?
 -Yes!

169
00:21:27.440 --> 00:21:32.600
Mom always liked so well in your garden, Ingrid.

170
00:21:32.760 --> 00:21:39.120
She used to say that Ingrid had the finest roses on the street.

171
00:21:39.280 --> 00:21:43.880
- Then it becomes organic too.
 –And we don't have the coffin.

172
00:21:44.040 --> 00:21:51.200
- Should mom decay in a compost?
 - Yes, because Mom had wanted!

173
00:22:04.760 --> 00:22:07.520
Piiip!

174
00:22:10.160 --> 00:22:12.640
Paul ...

175
00:22:15.760 --> 00:22:17.160
Thanks!

176
00:22:17.320 --> 00:22:21.240
I was very close to my mom towards the end.

177
00:22:21.400 --> 00:22:26.560
She never talked about compost or cardboard boxes.

178
00:22:26.720 --> 00:22:33.000
- I want to give her a nice funeral.
 - We also want to, Magnus.

179
00:22:33.160 --> 00:22:36.720
I have a savings account.

180
00:22:36.880 --> 00:22:41.920
I was going to save if I have children ...

181
00:22:42.080 --> 00:22:47.640
But I can work extra on the weekends.
 I can pay everything.

182
00:22:47.800 --> 00:22:50.880
Yes, if you want it ...

183
00:22:51.040 --> 00:22:57.000
Then Jörgen does not have to make a cross.
 He is not a star on woodwork.

184
00:22:57.160 --> 00:23:02.640
You would have seen what he came home with last - a stick!

185
00:23:04.600 --> 00:23:09.120
- Yeah, then this was done.
 - nice.

186
00:23:09.280 --> 00:23:13.360
Did mom have more gingerbread?

187
00:23:13.520 --> 00:23:17.800
-No!
 -No...!

188
00:23:33.560 --> 00:23:37.600
- Don't leave me, Torbjörn!
 - I'm here, André.

189
00:23:37.760 --> 00:23:40.640
Never again should I ...

190
00:23:41.840 --> 00:23:46.600
- I want a development call.
 - You start.

191
00:23:46.760 --> 00:23:54.160
I feel that I am not heard for my ideas.
 You're not listening to me.

192
00:23:54.320 --> 00:23:57.160
What do you say about that?

193
00:24:06.000 --> 00:24:12.000
What the hell would I do after lunch?
 I don't get it.

194
00:24:12.160 --> 00:24:15.800
Work?
 I forgot that last week.

195
00:24:15.960 --> 00:24:23.400
No, I have written up.
 "You work at Wasa, Götgatan 13."

196
00:24:23.560 --> 00:24:29.960
"Your office is at the bottom of the corridor."
 So work is not.

197
00:24:30.120 --> 00:24:37.840
-Do you have kids?
 It can be.
 - No, when would I have got them?

198
00:24:38.000 --> 00:24:44.720
Although I was in the hospital a few weeks ago and met a doctor ...

199
00:24:44.880 --> 00:24:50.960
Before I forget it - can we have a meeting tomorrow with the web group?

200
00:24:51.120 --> 00:24:54.880
- Yes, that would work.
 -Good.

201
00:24:59.120 --> 00:25:04.520
I go home for lunch.
 We are north now, huh?

202
00:25:06.200 --> 00:25:08.680
See you!

203
00:25:46.280 --> 00:25:48.800
Hide the paper.

204
00:25:49.680 --> 00:25:53.760
-Hello!
 -Hello!
 We're not ready yet ...

205
00:25:53.920 --> 00:26:00.240
- Are you already here?
 We are not done.
 - We are probably a little early.

206
00:26:00.400 --> 00:26:04.080
Come in, come in.

207
00:26:07.560 --> 00:26:11.440
The water is on.
 I'll peel potatoes.

208
00:26:12.240 --> 00:26:15.200
Lets see...

209
00:26:18.880 --> 00:26:26.400
- What is said about Sjötunga Walewska?
 -Good!
 But we have no sea tongue.

210
00:26:26.560 --> 00:26:32.520
It is probably better with something that goes faster, so we can get the cinema.

211
00:26:32.680 --> 00:26:38.720
-Meat!
 Don't we have turkey in the freezer?
 - Giant idea!

212
00:26:38.880 --> 00:26:44.400
I invite the guests to some wine for so long.
 The house's white!

213
00:26:46.800 --> 00:26:53.320
This would be clear today, but I got started a little late.

214
00:26:54.960 --> 00:26:58.680
This is going to stand for 22 days.

215
00:27:04.240 --> 00:27:07.600
Cheers and welcome!

216
00:27:11.960 --> 00:27:17.000
Oh, fuck!
 This is pure fox poison.

217
00:27:17.720 --> 00:27:20.800
It is not possible to drink.

218
00:27:20.960 --> 00:27:23.880
Can you help me with the table?

219
00:27:29.840 --> 00:27:32.840
There it should be ...

220
00:28:01.520 --> 00:28:04.000
SVT Program Setting: Agnes Malm Skoglund

221
00:28:07.680 --> 00:28:12.000
The bus has passed.
 We miss the cinema.

222
00:28:12.160 --> 00:28:15.360
Then we would not have had to run!
