00:00:01.400 --> 00:00:08.000
In tonight's section of Ifs, quiz about all culture in Sweden:

2
00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:11.120
The Syrian who moved Özz Nûjen - Filip Dikmen.

3
00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:14.320
The talk mill from Pakistan - Adeel Faqih.

4
00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:17.480
The Persian humor priestess - Zinat Pirzadeh.

5
00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:20.840
The Kurd who speaks better German than Swedish - Big O.

6
00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.200
The zucchini turk from Alby - Thanos Fatas.

7
00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:27.960
The sweet version of Saddam Hussein - Elaf Ali.

8
00:00:28.120 --> 00:00:31.640
The Serbian Humortorpeden - Branne Pavlovic.

9
00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:35.160
Humor Sweden's Yao Ming - Evelyn Mok.

10
00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:40.880
And as a black cream on the mash, our program manager Ahmed Berhan!

11
00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:45.560
Send a text message to SOS and say it burns in Studio 1.

12
00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:51.560
The atmosphere is "mmm"!
 You look at the quiz about all culture in Sweden.

13
00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:57.640
It's time to meet our competitors.
 Next to me, from the sump - Frida!

14
00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.200
All the way from Gothenburg - Mattias!

15
00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:08.480
And last but not least - Gunilla Persson!

16
00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:14.240
The game goes like this: you choose a panelist, I ask a question -

17
00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:17.960
- And you decide if the panelist is lying.

18
00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:21.440
Frida, we start with you.
 Who do you choose?

19
00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:26.360
I want to start with Evelyn.
 I feel we have some connection.

20
00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:30.520
Sweden sees itself as an innovation country -

21
00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:34.960
–And Poles as a craftsman.
 But they are inventive.

22
00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:39.240
Which of the following was not invented by a pole?

23
00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:46.600
I think it was a collage - hard to find a picture of black jobs.

24
00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:52.920
Here's how: Poles are innovative.

25
00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:56.760
They have invented some stuff, but not all.

26
00:01:56.920 --> 00:02:03.400
What have they invented?
 Stuff they can use in their operations.

27
00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:08.600
It is the bulletproof vest, the floor mop and the Walkie talk.

28
00:02:08.760 --> 00:02:13.040
But, Frida, have you ever seen a pole with a tops?

29
00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:19.120
- It's the one to go away.
 - I want to say false on it.

30
00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:22.080
You think it's false?

31
00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:26.360
Congratulations!
 You got your first point!

32
00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:32.680
The correct answer is the floor mop, which was not invented by a pole.

33
00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:35.960
They are just good at using it.

34
00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:40.920
- Mattias?
 - I feel a Connection with Elaf.

35
00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:43.600
OOOH!

36
00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:49.840
You choose Elaf.
 - Elaf?

37
00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:58.240
Mattias, the answer is finished toilet paper.

38
00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:06.000
Why?
 Because during the Sabbath you must not do ... you must not work -

39
00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:10.560
- And to demolish toilet paper is counted as work.

40
00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:17.320
They prepare by tearing a lot of paper so that it lasts all day.

41
00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:23.200
- Mattias?
 - I know you can't work.

42
00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:29.360
After all, it is quite a baroque that it would count ...

43
00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:33.760
- you?!
 Baroque?
 - Yes, what does it mean?

44
00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:36.560
It's crazy - crazy.

45
00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:40.920
- What does Baroque mean?
 - It's a barracks with an o in.

46
00:03:45.960 --> 00:03:49.080
It is so unlikely that it must be true.

47
00:03:49.240 --> 00:03:52.040
You say it's true?

48
00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:55.960
I have to do it, because it is so unlikely.

49
00:03:56.120 --> 00:03:59.520
Mazel Tov!
 You just got 1 point.

50
00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:06.640
There are 39 jobs you are not allowed to perform during the Sabbath -

51
00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:12.040
–Bl.a.
 Cook, light and extinguish lamps and tear things like toilet paper.

52
00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:16.280
- Drying.
 - What is Baroque?
 I want an answer!

53
00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:19.920
You may go on SFI.

54
00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:28.240
- Can anyone explain, the man?
 - Extremely very strange.

55
00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:31.560
- Gunilla, welcome into the match.
 -Thanks.

56
00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:34.240
-How are you?
 -Good.

57
00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:39.400
You are called Gunilla Persson?
 What do you think about the other Gunilla Persson?

58
00:04:39.560 --> 00:04:42.440
Is she worth your name?

59
00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:45.760
She is not worthy, I think.

60
00:04:47.080 --> 00:04:51.200
Gunilla came to Ifs and said, "There can only be one!"

61
00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:55.400
Just right!
 You can only choose one panelist.
 Who?

62
00:04:55.560 --> 00:05:01.240
I really wanted to choose Evelyn.
 We met in the entrance, so I ...

63
00:05:01.400 --> 00:05:05.240
It was another Chinese, it wasn't ...

64
00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:12.000
But then ... The first to take me in the hand of the participants was Adeel.

65
00:05:16.920 --> 00:05:19.120
!

66
00:05:25.120 --> 00:05:30.760
Immigrants who come here when they are 16 are 36, so there will be a diff.

67
00:05:30.920 --> 00:05:35.920
I was three months when I came to Sweden.
 I had a beard then too.

68
00:05:36.080 --> 00:05:38.320
Joking aside...

69
00:05:38.480 --> 00:05:43.560
What a positive question you got.
 How fun.
 Thanks, Ahmed!
 We die early.

70
00:05:43.720 --> 00:05:46.800
It's as you might think, maybe ...

71
00:05:46.960 --> 00:05:52.360
Swedish -born lives about 4.5 years longer than foreign -born do.

72
00:05:53.200 --> 00:05:57.640
- What do you say Gunilla?
 -It is difficult.
 We are all humans.

73
00:05:57.800 --> 00:06:03.560
No matter where we come from, I think we should live as long.

74
00:06:03.720 --> 00:06:06.040
So it so.

75
00:06:06.200 --> 00:06:09.680
Easy for you to say, living longer.

76
00:06:09.840 --> 00:06:15.480
I want to say it's false.
 Because I think it should be.

77
00:06:15.640 --> 00:06:20.440
- But the game is not about it.
 - Well, not?

78
00:06:20.600 --> 00:06:24.880
-Shucks!
 No, but ... - But what do you think?

79
00:06:25.040 --> 00:06:30.320
I think foreign -born lives 4.5 years shorter.

80
00:06:30.480 --> 00:06:34.000
You should have gone on what you were hoping for.

81
00:06:34.160 --> 00:06:37.440
It was false.

82
00:06:37.600 --> 00:06:42.520
Overt European immigrants in Sweden live longer than Swedish -born.

83
00:06:42.680 --> 00:06:46.560
For men, the difference is 2 years and for women 1.5.

84
00:06:46.720 --> 00:06:50.160
In your face!

85
00:06:52.800 --> 00:06:58.160
- Frida, who in the panel do you choose?
 - I chop the last girl - Zinat.

86
00:06:58.320 --> 00:07:01.440
- Zinate.
 -Hello.

87
00:07:03.560 --> 00:07:08.680
If you feel scratchy, many Iranians say that Nabat is the cure.

88
00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:17.240
A combo of petroleum jelly and cannabis, which you use when feeling bad.

89
00:07:17.400 --> 00:07:24.560
You roll it together and put it in the rectum, so everything will be fine.

90
00:07:28.520 --> 00:07:30.520
Ehm ...

91
00:07:32.200 --> 00:07:35.200
I'm just kidding!
 Just kidding.

92
00:07:35.360 --> 00:07:40.360
I'm just kidding, actually.
 Nabat is incredibly nice and liberating.

93
00:07:42.400 --> 00:07:48.680
It is so that when you feel bad you should bazza alone.

94
00:07:48.840 --> 00:07:56.320
- It means that you ... - bazza alone, it means this ...

95
00:07:56.480 --> 00:08:01.120
We have just introduced a new word: "Bazza alone".

96
00:08:01.280 --> 00:08:04.080
I'm more confused now!

97
00:08:04.240 --> 00:08:07.440
And women can too!

98
00:08:08.680 --> 00:08:15.920
One should make sure to satisfy yourself every day of the week -

99
00:08:16.080 --> 00:08:20.920
-And when it gets very moist or sprayed ...

100
00:08:21.880 --> 00:08:28.000
... and everything comes out, it means you got all the bacteria!

101
00:08:28.160 --> 00:08:32.600
And then you will feel good.
 It's Nabat!

102
00:08:35.360 --> 00:08:41.520
- I see your total confusion.
 - What is I going to answer?

103
00:08:41.680 --> 00:08:45.640
Nabat in Persian means that when you are sick ...

104
00:08:45.800 --> 00:08:51.040
Then the recommendation that masturbation can get out of you the disease is much faster.

105
00:08:51.200 --> 00:08:55.360
You recommend "On the Low" to go home and ...

106
00:08:55.520 --> 00:08:59.960
-Just!
 -Oh God...!
 It sounds unreasonable ...

107
00:09:00.120 --> 00:09:03.600
But it feels like it can be true.

108
00:09:03.760 --> 00:09:09.640
You choose to believe that Nabat is a health course in the form of masturbation?

109
00:09:10.440 --> 00:09:12.680
Fy damn, what stupid!

110
00:09:12.840 --> 00:09:16.160
It sounds stupid because that's not true!

111
00:09:18.280 --> 00:09:21.120
Nice, Frida ...

112
00:09:21.280 --> 00:09:24.680
Zinat, on the other hand, sold it very well!

113
00:09:24.840 --> 00:09:28.800
Nabat is a saffron club ...

114
00:09:31.040 --> 00:09:34.680
That's what she said.

115
00:09:34.840 --> 00:09:40.360
... that will solve stomach problems, counteract muscle pain and provide energy.

116
00:09:40.520 --> 00:09:44.240
But it is not clear where to stop it.

117
00:09:45.240 --> 00:09:48.960
- I could have got it right?
 - A half point.

118
00:09:49.120 --> 00:09:55.080
- Mattias, who do you want to talk to?
 - I think Thanos ...

119
00:09:55.240 --> 00:09:57.720
What is Dalkurd?

120
00:09:57.880 --> 00:10:00.840
A Kurd from Dalarna!

121
00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:06.280
Dalkurd is the name of a valley horse painted in Kurdistan's colors.

122
00:10:07.280 --> 00:10:10.080
And ... /laughs /

123
00:10:12.400 --> 00:10:16.760
It was painted by an artist named Bawer Elmek ... /Laughter /

124
00:10:16.920 --> 00:10:19.560
Shut up!

125
00:10:21.720 --> 00:10:27.240
Can you be silent now?
 - He lived in Mora during the 80s and 90s.

126
00:10:29.040 --> 00:10:31.560
–Dalkurts ... - Dalkurd.

127
00:10:31.720 --> 00:10:35.040
-What did you say?
 –Dalkurd.

128
00:10:35.200 --> 00:10:37.720
Not Kurt!

129
00:10:40.880 --> 00:10:43.920
So ... me ...

130
00:10:44.080 --> 00:10:47.840
Tricky.
 It will be no on it.
 It's false.

131
00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:50.880
What do you think it is?

132
00:10:51.040 --> 00:10:56.280
I have no idea whatsoever!
 But I don't believe in a valley horse.

133
00:10:56.440 --> 00:11:00.760
You think it's false?
 You don't trust Thanos?

134
00:11:00.920 --> 00:11:04.640
Congratulations, you got 1 point!

135
00:11:04.800 --> 00:11:09.280
No, Dalkurd is not a valley horse in Kurdish colors.

136
00:11:09.440 --> 00:11:13.760
Dalkurd is a football team called Dalkurd FF.

137
00:11:13.920 --> 00:11:17.720
It was formed in Borlänge by Kurds, 2004.

138
00:11:18.720 --> 00:11:22.440
- Gunilla!
 You want to choose a panelist?
 -Absolutely!

139
00:11:22.600 --> 00:11:28.000
But you won't be able to do that.
 Do you know why?
 You have received a letter.

140
00:11:34.080 --> 00:11:36.800
What pillows.
 - There you are!

141
00:11:36.960 --> 00:11:41.200
And here I am - Dogge Doggelito.
 Live from Northern Botkyrka.

142
00:11:41.360 --> 00:11:46.240
Sometimes in the resort you hear the phrase "Abow".

143
00:11:55.480 --> 00:12:01.000
- It was smart.
 - So what do you think?
 Do you think Dogge ...?

144
00:12:01.160 --> 00:12:04.760
-He is lying.
 - It doesn't feel like "Abow" ...?

145
00:12:04.920 --> 00:12:10.880
- I say it's false.
 - So "Abow" does not mean "I bow"?

146
00:12:11.880 --> 00:12:16.120
I bow to you.
 Congratulations to your first point!

147
00:12:16.280 --> 00:12:18.760
Thanks!
 That makes me happy.

148
00:12:18.920 --> 00:12:24.600
"Abow" does not mean "I bow", that means "it was la 'fuck".

149
00:12:24.760 --> 00:12:28.000
- Yes, that sounds so.
 - Big o, put an abow.

150
00:12:28.160 --> 00:12:30.320
Abow, yes ...

151
00:12:36.200 --> 00:12:39.520
Najs.
 - Frida, now we drive.

152
00:12:39.680 --> 00:12:43.880
- We drive at Branne, then.
 - Branne?

153
00:12:45.760 --> 00:12:48.760
The cartel.

154
00:12:48.920 --> 00:12:51.960
Joking aside, it's ...

155
00:12:53.040 --> 00:12:58.480
This is true.
 These are the oil riots Johnsson.

156
00:12:58.640 --> 00:13:04.160
They are so called.
 They run a bunch of petrol stations in southern Sweden.

157
00:13:04.320 --> 00:13:08.360
They have ... they really buy oil.

158
00:13:09.400 --> 00:13:13.320
God, what a hard time!
 I want to say no on it.

159
00:13:13.480 --> 00:13:16.560
-Okay.
 -I do not know.
 I got to learn ...

160
00:13:16.720 --> 00:13:21.400
Another girl who was here said that you should not trust jugs.

161
00:13:23.960 --> 00:13:26.880
--Wow!
 - So you don't trust Branne?

162
00:13:27.040 --> 00:13:30.360
-No, I do not.
 -What the hell?

163
00:13:30.520 --> 00:13:35.520
Unfortunately, Frida.
 No point to you.
 Branne did not lie.

164
00:13:37.600 --> 00:13:41.480
The Oil Heakers Johnsson is a family business -

165
00:13:41.640 --> 00:13:45.040
- As sells fuels, lubricants - you name it.

166
00:13:45.200 --> 00:13:50.840
They established themselves in Småland and have small stations where the big ones closed down.

167
00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:54.720
Isn't it a bit racist with the sheikh picture?

168
00:13:54.880 --> 00:13:58.080
Arabs' equivalent to Blackface?

169
00:13:58.240 --> 00:14:03.400
-What do you think?
 You are Arab.
 - I think it's najs.

170
00:14:03.560 --> 00:14:07.160
- If you don't make fun.
 - Then it gets wrong ...

171
00:14:07.320 --> 00:14:10.920
- They can't have fun with Arabs.
 - You don't get that!

172
00:14:11.080 --> 00:14:15.680
Then it becomes bomb.
 It just says "boom"!

173
00:14:16.760 --> 00:14:21.520
Unfortunately, there was no point.
 We move on to Mattias.

174
00:14:21.680 --> 00:14:26.960
- Wear.
 Both Filip and Big O are ... - do we criminal out?

175
00:14:30.200 --> 00:14:34.800
Super good guys, I thought.
 I choose Filip.

176
00:14:34.960 --> 00:14:39.400
Filip, who said the winged words:

177
00:14:44.640 --> 00:14:48.600
It was the Left Party's Catarina Wahlgren -

178
00:14:48.760 --> 00:14:52.800
- As the city council ended with a rap on equality.

179
00:14:52.960 --> 00:14:57.720
She said, "We are all born with different spoons in the mouth, the man."

180
00:14:57.880 --> 00:15:02.880
In other words, she said: "Ant Wan, who are you to sell arenas, the man."

181
00:15:03.040 --> 00:15:08.080
"I'm also here to sell rap" - Catarina Wahlgren.

182
00:15:10.760 --> 00:15:16.440
The thing about politicians singing is not super -uncomfortable in Sweden.

183
00:15:16.600 --> 00:15:19.920
- So I trust you.
 -It's true?

184
00:15:20.080 --> 00:15:23.760
That is absolutely right.
 Sure it's true!

185
00:15:24.880 --> 00:15:30.520
For those of you who do not remember - 2021, V's Catarina Wahlgren - finished

186
00:15:30.680 --> 00:15:34.360
- A speech in the municipal council with a rap.

187
00:15:34.520 --> 00:15:39.120
The text was about inequality and that we are born with different spoons in the mouth.

188
00:15:39.280 --> 00:15:42.600
Of course, we should look at it now.

189
00:15:42.760 --> 00:15:45.480
We are all born with different spoons in the mouth, man

190
00:15:45.640 --> 00:15:49.680
And EY, we were born in Stockholm, Sweden's richest region

191
00:15:49.840 --> 00:15:52.840
at least on choice of care

192
00:15:53.760 --> 00:15:56.040
What?

193
00:15:56.200 --> 00:16:00.880
Gunilla, you have 1 point.
 So has Frida.

194
00:16:01.040 --> 00:16:06.240
So if you take this question, you move on.
 It hangs some on it.

195
00:16:06.400 --> 00:16:13.120
- Then Big "O" must be very kind.
 - Big "O"?
 - Best Gunilla ...

196
00:16:16.240 --> 00:16:19.360
- Big o ... –Jalla, brother, Jalla.

197
00:16:23.600 --> 00:16:29.440
Gunilla, what is different is that they are pork.
 It's Haram, Yani.

198
00:16:29.600 --> 00:16:35.160
- If you want to be Jetski ... - the man, it's a pity for her!

199
00:16:35.320 --> 00:16:38.520
That's enough, the man.

200
00:16:38.680 --> 00:16:44.200
What is different ... what is different is -

201
00:16:44.360 --> 00:16:49.920
- The meat there is not beef or lamb.
 Do you understand?
 It's pork.

202
00:16:50.080 --> 00:16:56.200
So if you want to specify… /Laughter /

203
00:16:56.360 --> 00:16:58.720
I try to!

204
00:16:58.880 --> 00:17:05.800
So if you want to pecificerra ... must you say: "I want beef or lamb."

205
00:17:05.960 --> 00:17:10.040
If you want to be halal, you want to chill to you ...

206
00:17:10.200 --> 00:17:12.320
Applause!

207
00:17:18.880 --> 00:17:27.320
-What are you saying?
 You look skeptical.
 -Yes.
 Kebab is definitely not pork.

208
00:17:27.480 --> 00:17:32.400
God, what it's hard!
 I actually think that can be true.

209
00:17:32.560 --> 00:17:36.040
You think it's true?
 Do you know what, Gunilla?

210
00:17:37.720 --> 00:17:41.360
Congratulations!
 You got another one.

211
00:17:45.240 --> 00:17:49.960
It is true that on some parts of the west coast, the kebab is made of pork -

212
00:17:50.120 --> 00:17:54.880
- For those bastards have not learned what a gyros are.

213
00:17:55.040 --> 00:17:58.920
The largest Islamophobic hate crime in Sweden is -

214
00:17:59.080 --> 00:18:03.320
- Selling a kebab made on pork!

215
00:18:05.120 --> 00:18:08.200
Gunilla, Congratulations - you have moved on.

216
00:18:08.360 --> 00:18:13.560
Frida, unfortunately ... Thanks for being competing.
 Fun to have you here.

217
00:18:13.720 --> 00:18:16.720
Now it's time for the duel.

218
00:18:19.600 --> 00:18:25.040
The duel goes like this: I choose the panelists that you can talk to.

219
00:18:25.200 --> 00:18:28.600
For each question I choose two panelists:

220
00:18:28.760 --> 00:18:34.520
One speaks the truth and one is lying.
 You should find the true answer.

221
00:18:34.680 --> 00:18:39.760
Mattias, your first two panelists are Thanos and Evelyn.

222
00:18:41.840 --> 00:18:44.600
Thanos and Evelyn:

223
00:18:46.400 --> 00:18:49.120
It was a beef.

224
00:18:49.280 --> 00:18:54.080
Dr.
 Alban was angry that he felt they harassed him.

225
00:18:54.240 --> 00:18:58.000
They made sketches where they imitated him -

226
00:18:58.160 --> 00:19:02.720
- And bush and talked like him.
 He said, "This is not okay."

227
00:19:02.880 --> 00:19:06.960
- That was what the beef was about.
 - A Chinese Dr.
 Albanian...

228
00:19:08.040 --> 00:19:11.560
- It was stable.
 - No, this is how it is ...

229
00:19:11.720 --> 00:19:15.200
Dr.
 Alban was in a radio program at SR–

230
00:19:15.360 --> 00:19:19.920
- Where the host refused to say "Doctor".

231
00:19:20.080 --> 00:19:23.680
He referred to Dr.
 Alban only as alban-

232
00:19:23.840 --> 00:19:29.080
–And Dr.
 Alban very angry because he is a trained dentist.

233
00:19:29.240 --> 00:19:33.440
So he thought he should be addressed as a doctor.

234
00:19:33.600 --> 00:19:38.880
Have!
 It was the sickest thing I've heard.

235
00:19:39.040 --> 00:19:44.360
- Do you trust Thanos?!
 - Mattias, you are an accountant, right?

236
00:19:44.520 --> 00:19:48.200
- Yes, accounting consultant.
 - You count money.

237
00:19:48.360 --> 00:19:52.440
-Yes.
 - What sounds more logical?

238
00:19:52.600 --> 00:19:58.240
The thing is that both are very logical.
 That is the problem.

239
00:19:58.400 --> 00:20:01.400
But do you trust the Greek or Chinese?

240
00:20:01.560 --> 00:20:05.800
You buy that Dr.
 Alban is a trained dentist?

241
00:20:05.960 --> 00:20:09.640
You think he stands and says, "Can you gap?"

242
00:20:09.800 --> 00:20:14.720
I know that Dr.
 Alban is a dentist, so it sounds likely.

243
00:20:14.880 --> 00:20:17.760
I actually think ...

244
00:20:17.920 --> 00:20:22.080
Because you questioned Dr.
 Alban's dentistry ...

245
00:20:22.240 --> 00:20:26.880
- And Evelyn is "in my heart forever".
 - You act on the emotions?

246
00:20:27.040 --> 00:20:31.280
White men are usually attracted by Chinese women.

247
00:20:32.400 --> 00:20:35.480
We will get a happy ending.

248
00:20:39.280 --> 00:20:42.520
Evelyn, Mattias chose to believe in -

249
00:20:42.680 --> 00:20:48.000
- That Dr.
 Alban lacquered for refusing to title him Doctor.

250
00:20:48.160 --> 00:20:51.760
- Unfortunately, it is false.
 -No!

251
00:20:52.760 --> 00:20:57.640
It was Thanos who told the truth.
 Beefen between Dr.
 Alban and Sr-

252
00:20:57.800 --> 00:21:02.800
- traded about the program "Pippirull", where they bush and mimicked him.

253
00:21:02.960 --> 00:21:10.080
It was a good while ago, but we have got them to send a video greeting.

254
00:21:10.240 --> 00:21:14.520
Hi, Ahmed and all the comedians in Ifs!
 Mårten Andersson here.

255
00:21:14.680 --> 00:21:17.960
I want to say sorry, once and for all.

256
00:21:18.120 --> 00:21:23.840
I apologize for the bus ring - but there are only 200-300 pieces.

257
00:21:24.000 --> 00:21:27.400
I say sorry!
 Or as you would have said:

258
00:21:27.560 --> 00:21:32.000
"All, they 'don't work. They' not stable. Hop. Stop!"

259
00:21:36.840 --> 00:21:39.600
No point this time.

260
00:21:39.760 --> 00:21:45.120
Your two panelists are Adeel and Big O.

261
00:21:47.520 --> 00:21:52.720
Adeel and Big O, in Kosovo there is a groom tradition - with Hi Dhander:

262
00:21:54.720 --> 00:21:57.480
Jalla, Paki.

263
00:21:59.600 --> 00:22:05.400
In Albanian ... before the wedding so ... Some Albanians like ...

264
00:22:06.560 --> 00:22:09.360
Veva ... I'm Paki and can't.

265
00:22:09.520 --> 00:22:16.240
So before he gets married, relatives and friends have to give him one last round.

266
00:22:16.400 --> 00:22:21.680
He should get hit, so he knows what to expect if he does something wrong.

267
00:22:21.840 --> 00:22:24.880
- I helped you last time.
 -Yes.

268
00:22:25.040 --> 00:22:29.760
-How?
 - Let me talk to the point.

269
00:22:29.920 --> 00:22:32.600
Okay, Gunilla ...

270
00:22:32.760 --> 00:22:38.120
It is an old tradition to tattoo the Albanian bird on the back-

271
00:22:38.280 --> 00:22:42.320
- So me hi dhander is a very old method -

272
00:22:42.480 --> 00:22:47.600
- To show that you are married to both woman and country.
 You yeah both.

273
00:22:51.240 --> 00:22:54.360
So every Alban has a bird on his back?

274
00:22:54.520 --> 00:22:58.360
- We take it then.
 - You can't fool her that way.

275
00:22:58.520 --> 00:23:01.520
I helped Shurda last time.

276
00:23:01.680 --> 00:23:05.720
What do you feel, Gunilla?
 Do you believe in Adeel?

277
00:23:05.880 --> 00:23:09.840
- That you abuse the groom?
 - You raise him.

278
00:23:10.000 --> 00:23:15.360
Or do you believe in Big O, that you tattoo the Albanian bird -

279
00:23:15.520 --> 00:23:18.560
- As a symbol of both woman and country.

280
00:23:18.720 --> 00:23:23.760
- No, I believe in Adeel.
 - You choose Adeel?
 Gunilla ...

281
00:23:23.920 --> 00:23:28.000
You are from the resort.
 Congratulations!
 You got your first point.

282
00:23:28.160 --> 00:23:30.560
High five!

283
00:23:30.720 --> 00:23:35.520
Me hi Dhander is an old tradition for some Albanians before the marriage.

284
00:23:35.680 --> 00:23:39.400
The groom meets relatives and friends -

285
00:23:39.560 --> 00:23:44.640
- As the groom beats, as a last raising before getting married.

286
00:23:44.800 --> 00:23:50.480
Mattias, we continue with you.
 You should talk to Zinat and Branne.

287
00:23:52.640 --> 00:23:55.680
Talk?

288
00:23:57.840 --> 00:24:02.840
The last Swede lives at that address - Adam Tensta.

289
00:24:06.200 --> 00:24:10.400
It's ... sorry, it's Mattias, right?

290
00:24:10.560 --> 00:24:15.560
It is the first Swedish Halal slaughterhouse that was opened.

291
00:24:15.720 --> 00:24:18.880
It is also open at holidays, like Ramadan.

292
00:24:19.040 --> 00:24:23.040
It is open to the public during holidays.

293
00:24:23.200 --> 00:24:27.600
Then you get to see the slaughter, if someone turns years ...

294
00:24:27.760 --> 00:24:33.520
No, it is actually an apartment there that is a museum.

295
00:24:33.680 --> 00:24:40.920
Any Svenne can go in there and see how we lived in the 60s.

296
00:24:41.080 --> 00:24:44.280
Before the Babs arrived.

297
00:24:44.440 --> 00:24:49.280
If we really cultivated potatoes in the living room -

298
00:24:49.440 --> 00:24:52.920
- Or if it was in the nursery.

299
00:24:54.520 --> 00:25:01.280
I am completely lost here.
 I have no idea how to think.

300
00:25:01.440 --> 00:25:06.840
- Branne told me that there ... - I think he took what I said.

301
00:25:08.920 --> 00:25:12.800
You can focus on zinat.

302
00:25:12.960 --> 00:25:16.240
I just renovate the memory.

303
00:25:16.400 --> 00:25:20.240
Zinat told me it's a museum apartment -

304
00:25:20.400 --> 00:25:24.720
-So you can see what it looked like in Tensta in the 60s.

305
00:25:24.880 --> 00:25:29.200
Thanks.
 I'm going on ... Branne.

306
00:25:29.360 --> 00:25:33.800
Actually ... It sounds least unreasonable.

307
00:25:33.960 --> 00:25:36.880
You choose to believe in Branne?

308
00:25:37.040 --> 00:25:42.520
Unfortunately, Mattias.
 There is not a halal slaughterhouse in an apartment ...

309
00:25:44.600 --> 00:25:51.160
... in Tensta.
 The true answer is what Zinat tried to tell.

310
00:25:51.320 --> 00:25:57.680
It is a museum apartment where you can see how it was in Tensta in the 60s.

311
00:25:57.840 --> 00:26:01.600
- Gunilla, should we invest in full pot?
 -Yes.

312
00:26:01.760 --> 00:26:05.040
The last question - you get Filip and Elaf.

313
00:26:07.920 --> 00:26:15.400
When you hang out at Möllevångstorget in Malmö you can hear the term "Gawad".

314
00:26:18.000 --> 00:26:23.200
Well, this word you hear at the end of the day.

315
00:26:23.360 --> 00:26:28.640
When you hear it is time to find fruit and vegetables -

316
00:26:28.800 --> 00:26:31.800
- For that means sale or good price.

317
00:26:31.960 --> 00:26:36.040
You hear the vegetable dealers scream, simply.

318
00:26:36.200 --> 00:26:41.560
Incorrect.
 The correct answer is that "Gawad" is a belligerent -

319
00:26:41.720 --> 00:26:47.800
- But it has a meaning in the form of who says it and not against whom.

320
00:26:47.960 --> 00:26:54.640
When some elderly people say it is more negative than when someone younger says it.

321
00:26:54.800 --> 00:26:57.960
Come at me bitch.
 What should you say now?

322
00:26:58.120 --> 00:27:01.960
- But what does the word itself mean?
 - HALIK.

323
00:27:02.120 --> 00:27:07.640
-Pimp?
 - Factically, here you get it.

324
00:27:07.800 --> 00:27:14.040
What this means is Elaf's manager, Halik, as you have to pronounce correctly ...

325
00:27:14.200 --> 00:27:18.640
With the enthusiasm Filip has, I believe in Filip.

326
00:27:18.800 --> 00:27:21.960
- You chose to believe in Filip?
 -Yes.
