37
00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:38.840
Bobs and the cops that they call and that f will do inta and then in the end we

38
00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:42.239

previously never seen the person in the area that I did not recognize eh so

45
00:04:27.199 --> 00:04:30.759
I noticed that there is a person outside my home back and forth and

46
00:04:30.759 --> 00:04:37.840
stand and try to get into the gate as it was loose down there mm eh when I

47
00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:42.600

48
00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:47.840
already they were waiting but they dared not come in because they were also worried when

49
00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:54.720

69
00:06:46.080 --> 00:06:51.800
that this is actually that is true this is something serious that will happen etc.

70
00:06:51.800 --> 00:06:57.919
Eh i first since it was so this guy that you described

76
00:07:25.800 --> 00:07:32.160
The gate up it was hard to see it was not really so bright but I noticed

77
00:07:32.160 --> 00:07:37.599
that this person was not I do not know we have never seen him

78
00:07:37.599 --> 00:07:43.000
earlier in the area we usually know each other the neighbors and the other area we

79
00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:47.680
see each other during the days but it was very unusual to me and plus I

80
00:07:47.680 --> 00:07:53.479
connected a bit with Bobs when they were on me all day during the day that it will happen

81
00:07:53.479 --> 00:07:58.240
something and there is threat picture and so directly i connected everything yes eh it

82
00:07:58.240 --> 00:08:03.680
the evening and so it was just that eh but did you someone else

83
00:08:03.680 --> 00:08:07.960
observance of this guy yes except it was a guy that he was dark

84
00:08:07.960 --> 00:08:13.280
dressed then how do you mean yes but if you were older or younger or were no it was

85
00:08:13.280 --> 00:08:19.199
pretty young guy so it was a young guy it was

86
00:08:19.280 --> 00:08:26.560
not mm around 2022 years the age can see yes

87
00:08:26.560 --> 00:08:30.840
Mm is reaching the tag that has hair color for or something

88
00:08:30.840 --> 00:08:38.000
like that he had such a short brief quite as cutting you frs it wasn't far was

89
00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:45.040
that something was pretty k as yes but just yes he had someone

90
00:08:45.040 --> 00:08:51.640
Beard or something like that I didn't really see the whole and when he got up on the stairs

91
00:08:51.640 --> 00:08:57.519
I had the phone I saw a bit through the holes but I I can't directly take

92
00:08:57.519 --> 00:09:03.120
forward him faces because it was very stressful while I had

93
00:09:03.120 --> 00:09:09.120
panic I phone was waiting for the police so I lost a lot but I will

94
00:09:09.120 --> 00:09:13.720
Remember when I bleed a little this with clothes and stuff I couldn't have directly

95
00:09:13.720 --> 00:09:19.920
be focusing early on that person no but then when i back it was already gone

96
00:09:19.920 --> 00:09:25.120
Yeah just ehm mound color then someone has mine of it

97
00:09:25.120 --> 00:09:30.120
black so it was a dark dark guy it was

98
00:09:30.120 --> 00:09:36.440
Mork but it was yes but is this something you see about the peephole in

99
00:09:36.440 --> 00:09:42.040
the outer door or see d n toward the gate gate since I came in I shouted they

100
00:09:42.040 --> 00:09:47.920
didn't he answer with my neighbor they just comit in mm so i closed quickly d

101
00:09:47.920 --> 00:09:52.480
the balcony and then back then he has been up already at the stairs exactly

102
00:09:52.480 --> 00:10:00.320
outside my door etc. where I saw a bit as I say but I did not have directly

103
00:10:00.320 --> 00:10:06.920
Focus No Prime Crime DSE But you do something special when is up there outside

104
00:10:06.920 --> 00:10:12.800
The door then you notice you do something special when up there no had the phone in hand

105
00:10:12.800 --> 00:10:19.079
I checked in the trunk a bit at him he had the cellphone in his hand but he used to take

106
00:10:19.079 --> 00:10:23.480
away the cellphone as soon as someone comes when he brings out his cellphone so it was not

107
00:10:23.480 --> 00:10:28.480
something special he g only he had the cellphone in his hand much more and then yes

108
00:10:28.480 --> 00:10:35.440
But a little clear control of the pages since you come in and so there etc. How do you mean

109
00:10:35.440 --> 00:10:40.120
that he you said he takes up the cellphone when reaching came when reaching came when reaching then comes then

110
00:10:40.120 --> 00:10:43.760
he takes his cellphone so fast when it is gone when he puts back in his

111
00:10:43.760 --> 00:10:52.240
Pocket so kind of yes and when I get extra concern when I saw this too

112
00:10:52.240 --> 00:10:58.240
clearly yes just that but I had while waiting for the police too they respond and

113
00:10:58.240 --> 00:11:03.959
will come and a little check and check here in the area eh that they have signed under

114
00:11:03.959 --> 00:11:09.200
day that there is foot image and and that person was very much for me new person

115
00:11:09.200 --> 00:11:15.399
new eh there was no one you recognized no no no no such young guy we have

116
00:11:15.399 --> 00:11:20.560
not in the area even if there are you all have their key on the gate they go in

117
00:11:20.560 --> 00:11:27.279
with so it is no one will stand outside the gates and in that way but it it

118
00:11:27.279 --> 00:11:31.880
the gate is locked otherwise on is after nine o'clock it is resolved and it was after all

119
00:11:31.880 --> 00:11:38.240
After nine they were he was in place yes what do you remember what time can be out of

120
00:11:38.240 --> 00:11:43.760
that it was after nine oh I don't actually know exactly but it could be around ten

121
00:11:43.760 --> 00:11:47.880
So the time I don't really know but I know it was after nine gates

122
00:11:47.880 --> 00:11:54.560
Be loose etc. Yes but I understand it can be around 11 you 10 11

n you shouts none of them not he not my neighbor no ok okay it there

125

133
00:12:43.639 --> 00:12:49.839
drop off and take and calm and sleep I have made the whole dark home and then have

134
00:12:49.839 --> 00:12:55.040

135
00:12:55.040 --> 00:13:00.480
So down the resort then immediately I wake up and check if there is something that happens

136

It is as usual just yes but just eh no but then I probably had no

177
00:16:40.360 --> 00:16:46.720
More questions etc. then we'll see about MÃ¥s Questions Yes Thanks Hello like this I also have some

178
00:16:46.720 --> 00:16:51.560
questions eh you told us here initially that you had been in

179
00:16:51.560 --> 00:16:55.880
contact with the police several times during this day and got it that

180
00:16:55.880 --> 00:17:01.639
was there a threat to the family thought F How long before this event

181
00:17:01.639 --> 00:17:04.799
Have you been in contact with the police or with

182
00:17:04.799 --> 00:17:10.839
Bobs the day before they were at home too

183
00:17:10.839 --> 00:17:17.959
eh they told me a little briefly that there is threat picture eh but they were not entirely sure

184
00:17:17.959 --> 00:17:25.880
they didn't know but they just wanted me to inform us it could happen but they have

185
00:17:25.880 --> 00:17:30.960
not invited that we should leave the apartment etc. they have not offer it yet

186
00:17:30.960 --> 00:17:37.880
But they informed us that there is so for me it was very difficult and and take it

187
00:17:37.880 --> 00:17:43.000
here accept that because there were very much questions about why I have

188
00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:49.400
no problems with any eh why v should have there are such threats run my kids etc.

189
00:17:49.400 --> 00:17:53.919
I work my kids have school and job so there is no thing I couldn't

190
00:17:53.919 --> 00:17:59.000
Purpose immediately it f was very difficult so so at this time when you

191
00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:04.480
got information about the threat picture it was new information for you then eh that day eh d

192
00:18:04.480 --> 00:18:10.440
Inan yes when the cops were at home etc. and then you tell you about this

193
00:18:10.440 --> 00:18:15.720
observation you made this man who moved the staircase

194
00:18:15.720 --> 00:18:21.919
ehm as you described I think what did you do any connection from it

195
00:18:21.919 --> 00:18:29.159
The police had said that what you saw there what do you mean you tell you

196
00:18:29.159 --> 00:18:33.919
you say when you wake up then there will be chaos etc. but think before that do you

197
00:18:33.919 --> 00:18:38.720
any connection with between what the police have said about the threat picture man moving

198
00:18:38.720 --> 00:18:43.720
staircase yes yes but of course directly this day when they called me bobs

199
00:18:43.720 --> 00:18:51.400
called me eh when worry about me gets bigger mm when I thought yes but then must

200
00:18:51.400 --> 00:18:56.440
So I think through and believe it there must be something otherwise

201
00:18:56.440 --> 00:19:02.120
the police without grove not button on my door if there is no other seriousness

202
00:19:02.120 --> 00:19:06.880
Mm so what I thought very much after there but I couldn't take out what is

203
00:19:06.880 --> 00:19:13.240
it like hb and why mm so it makes me very difficult mm to accept this

204
00:19:13.240 --> 00:19:17.640
Mm you've been on you a little bit but I was going to ask you if you could develop

205
00:19:17.640 --> 00:19:22.760
Can you describe to us how did you experience this event what what like

206
00:19:22.760 --> 00:19:27.159
aroused it for feelings in you it is a lot that is very much indeed and

207
00:19:27.159 --> 00:19:31.120
I think if we first focus on below

208
00:19:31.120 --> 00:19:35.880
The evening can you describe to us how you felt

209
00:19:35.880 --> 00:19:42.880
Then it was a very difficult situation really as I cannot describe is

210
00:19:42.880 --> 00:19:51.840
very messy and scary can s I can sit in dark for two weeks thus

211
00:19:51.840 --> 00:19:59.960
wave and just think and so fast when reaching the fbi the man I become extra worry what is

212
00:19:59.960 --> 00:20:04.559
as happens it may come to happen because I don't know who is trying to burn

213
00:20:04.559 --> 00:20:10.840
m m my child it is very difficult situation it was for me

214
00:20:11.480 --> 00:20:18.240
really so both in the meantime but even afterwards it is so you should understand that you

215
00:20:18.240 --> 00:20:24.400
know this turmoil very much so I've lost everything mm eh I force

216
00:20:24.400 --> 00:20:30.640
also actually in contact doctor because of it mm so it was not good

217
00:20:30.640 --> 00:20:36.000
Time for me you can describe for how long this turmoil has been sitting in

218
00:20:36.000 --> 00:20:40.760
and how has the period after been for you it was very difficult especially they

219
00:20:40.760 --> 00:20:46.480
where the first two weeks eh that i could not work i could not do anything

220
00:20:46.480 --> 00:20:51.679
because they are just in control and account and it is together the cops v so fast

221
00:20:51.679 --> 00:20:56.760
my thing happened immediately i called them and contacted them so it was me for

222
00:20:56.760 --> 00:21:01.760
me it was not ordinary life etc. I did not have normal life until the police

223
00:21:01.760 --> 00:21:07.440
called and that I can go back to my job and then careful start slowly

224
00:21:07.440 --> 00:21:14.559
I force Leave home too two weeks so we should not at home etc. eh

225
00:21:14.559 --> 00:21:20.960
During the days two weeks from this event when yes etc. have you been allowed to change

226
00:21:20.960 --> 00:21:24.919
your routines or yes but that is obviously man

227
00:21:24.919 --> 00:21:29.919
Becomes otherwise, etc. It becomes obvious you lose routines you

228
00:21:29.919 --> 00:21:33.840
loses that you should thus get me because it is difficult to eat too

229
00:21:33.840 --> 00:21:40.720
I had huge stress anxiety eh so while I forcibly contact

230
00:21:40.720 --> 00:21:47.000
the doctor who received medicine can release calmly down me and try and

231
00:21:47.000 --> 00:21:53.760
Sleep etc. No it was very really the situation very difficult for us etc. and

232
00:21:53.760 --> 00:21:58.880
Do you have how have you done some G Tagels about how your children have reacted to here

233
00:21:58.880 --> 00:22:04.320
Yes they also affect mm in what way has it noticed on them the same as me they

234
00:22:04.320 --> 00:22:10.679
was also concern even if they did not want to show clearly but I felt them their

235
00:22:10.679 --> 00:22:18.080
worry also the same thing as m they had mm eh they were at work in the days late

236
00:22:18.080 --> 00:22:25.000
evenings late we used to come home really late when everything gets dark and calm

237
00:22:25.000 --> 00:22:29.559
Then you think you are like their mother in what way do you notice on them that they

238
00:22:29.559 --> 00:22:36.880
Also are worried about food I thought noticed a lot the lost food that they should

239
00:22:36.880 --> 00:22:44.640
hard to eat ehm so it was just like me and how

240
00:22:44.640 --> 00:22:49.400
How will your children become when they get worried they will be open up and talk

241
00:22:49.400 --> 00:22:56.440
Or do they get closed no no no how how it was much more quiet and

242
00:22:56.440 --> 00:23:05.480
think and as i all said to lose this with patit with not eating food

243
00:23:06.400 --> 00:23:11.240
mm mm you were awake too I usually I noticed on them that they were after all

244
00:23:11.240 --> 00:23:18.760
awake at night but was it silent more in the room bed mm it is hard to sleep

245
00:23:18.760 --> 00:23:22.120
just like me, so I was actually affected the whole

246
00:23:22.120 --> 00:23:25.080
[Music] Family

247
00:23:25.080 --> 00:23:30.400
Mm Thanks then I do not have any more questions for you etc. then we will see if

248
00:23:30.400 --> 00:23:33.360

249
00:23:33.360 --> 00:23:38.679
sitting here lawyer larsson no thanks no questions lawyer that no questions thanked

250
00:23:38.679 --> 00:23:47.440
Boklund yes I had a question here only about the threat to your son m

251
00:23:47.440 --> 00:23:53.840
The threat to your son etc. What do you know more about it or what did the police told you about

252
00:23:53.840 --> 00:24:01.279
that no but that i didn't really get direct information was the threat picture to me

253
00:24:01.279 --> 00:24:07.919
or against my son etc. but only they said there is a threat picture we have to protect you

254
00:24:07.919 --> 00:24:15.120
Mm I did not know more than that yes because you have when you are heard by the police so you have

255
00:24:15.120 --> 00:24:20.480
told a little neighbor about his dry accommodation that there would arise any threat picture on

256
00:24:20.480 --> 00:24:27.360
against him what eh you were told by the police to on the son's

257
00:24:27.360 --> 00:24:32.840
former accommodation etc so he would have been offered and do something and first

258
00:24:32.840 --> 00:24:39.000
I thanked me and then thanked no etc. it is true you remember it yes but

259
00:24:39.000 --> 00:24:44.559
It is the police they have such information yes and do you know what it was to

260
00:24:44.559 --> 00:24:51.159
do something no yes yes here they have written then on page 11 in insurance

261
00:24:51.159 --> 00:24:56.640
the protocol that he would go and hurt someone in Stockholm etc. and so he had

262
00:24:56.640 --> 00:25:02.919
First said yes but then changed and said no and then it became a threat to him

263
00:25:02.919 --> 00:25:07.399
I don't know the police know yes that was the police told me like me I know

264
00:25:07.399 --> 00:25:12.760
not really the whole story etc. they don't tell you

265
00:25:13.360 --> 00:25:18.000
much yes they told us right about stock but what I know I am very grateful

266
00:25:18.000 --> 00:25:23.600
that my son has thanked me for it did not go on with it a child m

267
00:25:23.600 --> 00:25:29.080
m Then I have no more questions m lawyer Olof no

268
00:25:29.080 --> 00:25:34.000

the recording and then recording was up and then it is the plaintiff's interrogation here with

390
00:37:11.560 --> 00:37:16.119

432
00:41:09.280 --> 00:41:14.160

Hi I will ask quite a few questions anyway Leon Eh but before I

436
00:41:28.400 --> 00:41:32.319
Starting with this so I just ask you to consider one thing I have all respect

437
00:41:32.319 --> 00:41:35.839
because you don't want to say anything it is like as you h chair totally okay

438
00:41:35.839 --> 00:41:40.520
but now keep in mind that you risk a very long prison sentence in the end of

439
00:41:40.520 --> 00:41:43.480
this negotiation so you have that mind so you don't miss that bit when

440
00:41:43.480 --> 00:41:50.680
you when choosing your strategy that hearing then first start with we have

441
00:41:50.680 --> 00:41:57.839
looked at phone numbers ending at 5140 that has to a phone that took in

442
00:41:57.839 --> 00:42:01.000
seizure from you this is your

443
00:42:01.440 --> 00:42:08.359
phone since then we have looked at a signal Alas San called S78 is that

444
00:42:08.359 --> 00:42:13.920

00:55:51.000 --> 00:55:58.079
Mm I say you have talked a little bit about Leon's belongings yes what what

589
00:55:58.079 --> 00:56:02.680
Do you know you know anything about the n Ã¶ck sofa choice yes it was like this

590
00:56:02.680 --> 00:56:07.079
that eh the same night as Leon went or the same

591
00:56:07.079 --> 00:56:15.640
day eh so i was there with eh two other eh and eh we took drugs then when i

592
00:56:15.640 --> 00:56:21.359
woke up so he was scream away then i'd go out and face them

593
00:56:21.359 --> 00:56:26.400
eh and since i took back that way i could take back

594
00:56:26.400 --> 00:56:33.440
then so when i'm maybe 10 meters from the gate eh they shout and serger that it

595
00:56:33.440 --> 00:56:38.240
standing TV outside his door too and then I thought to go back and leave

596
00:56:38.240 --> 00:56:43.400
it and then when i open the door eh so the police

597
00:56:47.720 --> 00:56:54.319
there so it wasn't v so this you have you have gathered some stuff for leon

598
00:56:54.319 --> 00:56:59.720
No have not collected no you have acted so that so no one so that if

599
00:56:59.720 --> 00:57:04.520
one would get stuck in some way that they no did not get away no lean has not said

600
00:57:04.520 --> 00:57:09.799
to me to gather stuff no no no it is you sure yes i have said

601
00:57:09.799 --> 00:57:16.359
that because eh I don't want what is the name of the other guys names no

602
00:57:16.359 --> 00:57:21.400
then there when the police arrived I was stressed etc. but I we agreed that you

603
00:57:21.400 --> 00:57:27.720
have said in police interviews that you are because you sam together Leon's stuff yes

604
00:57:27.720 --> 00:57:32.280
But I have said yes okay and what was it you said what was the reason you

605
00:57:32.280 --> 00:57:37.280
Collect up Leon's stuff then as you said I said he told me

606
00:57:37.280 --> 00:57:43.200
to make it yes but that is not right no exactly and where and what what do you say

607
00:57:43.200 --> 00:57:45.720
lasting reason he has said it was then something special that would

608
00:57:45.720 --> 00:57:50.160
So nothing special so that

609
00:57:50.160 --> 00:57:55.520
is not really right it was just something I said etc. I say that

610
00:57:55.520 --> 00:57:59.799
you had told the police then that it would gather Leon's stuff in case he

611
00:57:59.799 --> 00:58:04.359
would get stuck so that the police or SOS or anyone else would come

612
00:58:04.359 --> 00:58:12.720
ate the stuff yes exactly eh jaus it was yes okay i also say that you have

613
00:58:12.720 --> 00:58:16.559
helped Leon then by doing in the way it has been a support for him one

614
00:58:16.559 --> 00:58:21.359
security for him by looking at his stuff but then you now mean to

615
00:58:21.359 --> 00:58:27.880
Skill against the police that it is not true yes no that is not right no no okay

616
00:58:27.880 --> 00:58:34.000
Okay one eye just gonna make a listing here

617
00:58:46.200 --> 00:58:52.799
Eh mm there is, among other things, on page 403 when I just double check this now then

618
00:58:52.799 --> 00:58:57.319
that it's no more crazy Leon has said that if I don't

619
00:58:57.319 --> 00:59:01.440
coming back so I would take care of his things he said before he went

620
00:59:01.440 --> 00:59:05.440
And that was not true then no it is not true but that was what I said

621
00:59:05.440 --> 00:59:13.480
Yes but just exactly that you

622
00:59:19.280 --> 00:59:23.559
eh did you know anything about who this client was or who it was

623
00:59:23.559 --> 00:59:29.039
that had, as Leon had been in contact with to step then no no had you

624
00:59:29.039 --> 00:59:33.200
any nickname or something no so i can't say i know

625
00:59:33.200 --> 00:59:37.799
So it eh what he tells me and then what I have seen in his phone

626
00:59:37.799 --> 00:59:44.640
it is but i don't know who mm because there is also where i need

Yes it is right yes okay when he was tasting if it was

644
01:01:35.799 --> 01:01:39.640

646
01:01:44.760 --> 01:01:47.760
I

647
01:01:51.480 --> 01:01:56.680
Yes and then you say you don't know who this was about this but you

648
01:01:56.680 --> 01:02:03.359
mentioned that what they hbm was right, etc. yes just that then you actually have

649
01:02:03.359 --> 01:02:10.240

650
01:02:10.240 --> 01:02:16.720
Yes do you remember it no no

they come to Leon's apartment yes yes on who who this would be like

653
01:02:28.279 --> 01:02:33.960

01:02:41.880 --> 01:02:49.920
or did you find on yes i don't know i don't remember it was a long time yes

656
01:02:50.839 --> 01:02:55.680
Okay, I understand

657
01:03:00.079 --> 01:03:03.960
Then there is and this is the summary hearing so it can be

658
01:03:03.960 --> 01:03:07.440
a little performer but there is at 46 just well double check now because you say you

659
01:03:07.440 --> 01:03:11.440
does not remember who it is that has done what has offered L about this that you do not

660
01:03:11.440 --> 01:03:17.720
knew this then then you got the question at 406 after you denied crime then a

661
01:03:17.720 --> 01:03:23.599
suspected interrogation tell me all about this event Ã–rebro so talked about that

662
01:03:23.599 --> 01:03:27.720
Leon then it stands like this v feel hike

663
01:03:27.720 --> 01:03:31.160
Three months ago it was he who offers me to follow this on

664
01:03:31.160 --> 01:03:37.400
The thing is that Leon Rustic offers you to offer you to come along and step

665
01:03:37.400 --> 01:03:44.400
Eh what v did you say eh tuning that leon rustic offers you to follow along and step

666
01:03:44.400 --> 01:03:47.760
So I can't say that he's told me I have only seen

667
01:03:47.760 --> 01:03:54.839
Messages etc. where they said to pick up as many you can it had you seen yes it is

668
01:03:54.839 --> 01:03:58.760
What I have seen but not that he has told me that I will follow with no

669
01:03:58.760 --> 01:04:03.920
NO NO NO NO OK EH I said no Actually he goes it later

670
01:04:03.920 --> 01:04:08.680
Yes it is true or mm then i didn't know either if it was

671
01:04:08.680 --> 01:04:13.920
northbÃ¶ yes i didn't know no just like that but then then it came so

672
01:04:13.920 --> 01:04:20.200
It was another guy hambo who offered this job to Leon yes it could be

673
01:04:20.200 --> 01:04:26.599
so yeah but i don't remember no there were people over h who are his reball he on this

674
01:04:26.599 --> 01:04:35.079
The job yes I don't know no no just that but that it may be like that

675
01:04:35.079 --> 01:04:41.160
Yes exactly

676
01:04:44.000 --> 01:04:50.160
Mm and what was it that did you not know anything what

677
01:04:50.160 --> 01:04:56.039
would be done what what Leon would do now as he sat on the train no

678
01:04:56.039 --> 01:05:01.760
I didn't know anything so I said that I didn't want to keep up with no

679
01:05:01.760 --> 01:05:08.200
then yes no because there is a little more precise

680
01:05:08.200 --> 01:05:11.920
information here as as what it should be about as well as that D as I am changed

681
01:05:11.920 --> 01:05:18.520
a little neighbor but still got some information 411 because with you it is also

682
01:05:18.520 --> 01:05:23.880
reaching summary for know man they are a little easier to read about it

683
01:05:23.880 --> 01:05:28.839
Not getting eh's quarrels about words and

684
01:05:28.839 --> 01:05:35.520
between you can say this ehm how how come you don't

685
01:05:35.520 --> 01:05:41.200
that you did not keep up with this yes I said I regretted I did not want to

686
01:05:41.200 --> 01:05:45.839
make it no no but i understand it did you say but why don't you want to do it

687
01:05:45.839 --> 01:05:52.240
because I had been sitting on sis eh and i came out and i got apartment so i

688
01:05:52.240 --> 01:05:58.760
wanted to take the chance to take care of me etc. and just that just

689
01:05:59.359 --> 01:06:05.400
that's exactly because it also says on 411 here that in exactly the same way so that it

690
01:06:05.400 --> 01:06:11.760
that is nothing strange but that but so have you told you what

691
01:06:11.760 --> 01:06:19.799
it was as it was about here and you remembered did not say you were no but because then stands

692
01:06:19.799 --> 01:06:24.520
that is like this now that Alfon tells us that it was a guy named Hamko who offered

693
01:06:24.520 --> 01:06:32.559
rusti 200 thousands to blast a gate there is something you feel

694
01:06:32.559 --> 01:06:38.000
again thus that with blasting gate it is

695
01:06:38.000 --> 01:06:42.279
Just what Leon has believed that he is going to do etc. But no one has said he to say

696
01:06:42.279 --> 01:06:48.180
he'll do it no okay it was speculation

697
01:06:48.180 --> 01:06:53.960
[Music] mm just that

698
01:06:57.119 --> 01:07:05.240
Just that and what was it for who was on the top the donor then so who was

699
01:07:05.240 --> 01:07:10.480
What I do not know no because it appears here as well in the same paragraph then it

700
01:07:10.480 --> 01:07:15.400
As the police recorded here when Alfon thought that

701
01:07:15.400 --> 01:07:23.559
yes now so like this ehm rob has told me that it would step to the fox that it was

702
01:07:23.559 --> 01:07:30.440
A job for the fox against the strawberry yes how is that thing or

703
01:07:30.440 --> 01:07:34.039
Really or incorrectly just that day he does not tell you when he

704
01:07:34.039 --> 01:07:39.400
went he has told me that maybe a few days before but just that

705
01:07:39.400 --> 01:07:45.119
the day when he went he said nothing mm no ok okay he said it later

706
01:07:45.119 --> 01:07:49.880
Days type in the evening the night before he went hbo no

707
01:07:49.880 --> 01:07:55.680
the evening the same day yes yes okay so when he was in Ã–bro yeah okay he has

708
01:07:55.680 --> 01:08:01.119
not said anything when he was on the train or on his way no but you were perceived

709
01:08:01.119 --> 01:08:04.880
So did you realize that he would step when put on the train no not when he put

710
01:08:04.880 --> 01:08:08.640
themselves on the train I knew nothing I knew nothing and I didn't think so

711
01:08:08.640 --> 01:08:14.480
a lot on it mm just that yes but i

712
01:08:14.480 --> 01:08:18.239
Understand yes

713
01:08:22.480 --> 01:08:30.359
understand this now eh we talked about

714
01:08:30.359 --> 01:08:37.880
Hanko have you had any contact with the Hanko himself yes a little

715
01:08:37.880 --> 01:08:44.520
ehm we talk about for or after the event or both and thus may have

716
01:08:44.520 --> 01:08:52.480
been eh the year before eh and then maybe a little but we have not written with

717
01:08:52.480 --> 01:09:00.120

718
01:09:00.120 --> 01:09:06.880

no have you been in touch with N HK and something after

723
01:09:29.080 --> 01:09:36.440
The proportion thus we did not write him after the testimony hearing

724
01:09:36.440 --> 01:09:41.960
Mm eh when i said i had the testimony it was kind of it mm late

725
01:09:41.960 --> 01:09:45.199
have we not written anything so with each other we have sent pictures only

726
01:09:45.199 --> 01:09:51.359
So Snap Pictures Okay We haven't written anything with each other no okay

727
01:09:51.359 --> 01:09:56.239
So that after the event itself, the witness came the hay so it is there apartment

728
01:09:56.239 --> 01:10:01.000
Leon's apartment of that is what I tell you about yes and then you have had

729
01:10:01.000 --> 01:10:06.560
Contact Prim Crime DSE Yes or so I wrote to him that I had VN

730
01:10:06.560 --> 01:10:11.880
interrogation yes yes that is the one where we have written with each other about mm and what

731
01:10:11.880 --> 01:10:14.360
is this discussion about then

732
01:10:14.360 --> 01:10:19.360
or i just said i had witness for hears yes what did hamk say something about it

733
01:10:19.360 --> 01:10:25.600
Then that I don't remember no okay

734
01:10:25.600 --> 01:10:30.320
How did this conversations feel it okay yes so I will

735
01:10:30.320 --> 01:10:36.400
not remember it was a long time see yes you have somehow been threatened or

736
01:10:36.400 --> 01:10:47.080
anything by someone no no no you are sure yes mm

737
01:10:48.280 --> 01:10:54.320
okay eh and hemp then he says something or does he do something about as if

738
01:10:54.320 --> 01:11:00.560
about Leon Rustic then what this conversation now as you have you and

739
01:11:00.560 --> 01:11:05.320
Hanko is in any way about Leon Rustic also V he made or not

740
01:11:05.320 --> 01:11:09.640
done no I don't think it no it was just that I told you about

741
01:11:09.640 --> 01:11:15.480
The witness hearing etc. It is only that you tell about the witness's company yes yes

742
01:11:15.480 --> 01:11:19.679
Okay yes but

743
01:11:20.560 --> 01:11:24.560
Just mm

744
01:11:26.280 --> 01:11:28.679
just

745
01:11:30.560 --> 01:11:38.760
that yes you got no information at all from hamk what would have happened then no

746
01:11:38.760 --> 01:11:45.960
no did you know what had happened to Leon in this mode when you n when you

747
01:11:45.960 --> 01:11:50.040
have for with the police in the apartment you know you know that it is actually

748
01:11:50.040 --> 01:11:57.800
Gripen then yes so I look at the news etc. eh yes just that so that's just the way I

749
01:11:57.800 --> 01:12:03.639
got r yes okay just

750
01:12:07.440 --> 01:12:12.960
This is because it would have been contact with Hamko after the witness hearing

751
01:12:12.960 --> 01:12:18.199
It is something that has also talked about in interrogation then

752
01:12:18.199 --> 01:12:23.840
ehm There is a task there that deviates from what you say now about this

753
01:12:23.840 --> 01:12:32.360
the contacts in late 163 eh second question and the third question because then you have

754
01:12:32.360 --> 01:12:37.880
got the question like this then you have to read at the same time a tck

755
01:12:37.880 --> 01:12:44.080
Just should we just bring out page 463 and so the second question yes yes then stands

756
01:12:44.080 --> 01:12:48.480
This is how much have you and Hanko been in contact after the smiling is arrested

757
01:12:48.480 --> 01:12:53.120
And that then follows the police when I wrote to Hanko after I had

758
01:12:53.120 --> 01:12:59.320
Witnesses yes and then I wrote that the police had pictures of him he said that

759
01:12:59.320 --> 01:13:04.400
If someone comes it comes home to me and then he sends a picture at the address

760
01:13:04.400 --> 01:13:11.360
where my dad lives yes is not right it is not true no later

761
01:13:11.360 --> 01:13:17.880
So it appears the next part here then develop that he said you would not say

762
01:13:17.880 --> 01:13:23.840
something he said the guys know where you live and send my dad's old address

763
01:13:23.840 --> 01:13:30.360
And my old address yes it is not right no okay it is not true then is after all

764
01:13:30.360 --> 01:13:34.840
The question is of course how does it come so that it is like this then in the publisher I do not know

765
01:13:34.840 --> 01:13:39.199
No, so that with the guys I know where you live it may have been me

766
01:13:39.199 --> 01:13:45.920
mins that you were affected that day eh when I saw that message that

767
01:13:45.920 --> 01:13:52.679
may have been in that signal chat etc. in the group I have seen that message

768
01:13:52.679 --> 01:13:57.840
but that it was not directed at me yeah but your dad's address then is well

769
01:13:57.840 --> 01:14:01.480
Pretty right from you I think yes but that is not in line with the address

770
01:14:01.480 --> 01:14:08.440
It is not true no it will be like this on when I just said it yes

771
01:14:08.440 --> 01:14:14.760
Okay want to want to put E Hams or No

772
01:14:15.719 --> 01:14:24.159
no want to frsa to go free so that where i don't care it doesn't care no

773
01:14:24.159 --> 01:14:28.639
ok my s no so you want you don't want to put

774
01:14:28.639 --> 01:14:33.480
HSA but still it appears then that he would

775
01:14:33.480 --> 01:14:39.120
have threatened you by sending the address to your dad yes f that the guys know

776
01:14:39.120 --> 01:14:43.600
what you g yes you don't know why you said so

777
01:14:43.600 --> 01:14:47.639
there with the guys knowing where you should be right but I can't say that I

778
01:14:47.639 --> 01:14:53.040
Remember no, no really, so it was a long time since I didn't remember no

779
01:14:53.040 --> 01:14:56.639
But then the question is like this now that it can be true that it actually went on

780
01:14:56.639 --> 01:15:00.520
the way I read that you don't remember today yes I

781
01:15:00.520 --> 01:15:07.719
Don't remember no I remember only in the mean yes yes yes

782
01:15:10.360 --> 01:15:15.679
Okay ok but in and now you get to correct wrong now but it means it can go

783
01:15:15.679 --> 01:15:18.520
to the way I have read but it may also be

784
01:15:18.520 --> 01:15:23.800
Wrong so i'm not remembered no yes

785
01:15:25.239 --> 01:15:27.560
but then

786
01:15:31.199 --> 01:15:39.239
So then port is a little more about what will then shop

787
01:15:39.960 --> 01:15:50.200
If about eh your contacts with with Hamsa or hamk then

788
01:15:50.200 --> 01:15:55.520
[Music] ehm yes I heard it right that so you

789
01:15:55.520 --> 01:15:59.639
had not received any information about the incident from HamgÃ¥rd no I got

790
01:15:59.639 --> 01:16:03.639
No information no information

791
01:16:06.080 --> 01:16:12.149
No [music]

792
01:16:12.560 --> 01:16:20.159
ehm because then there is a task at 460 here that is about just that type there

793
01:16:20.159 --> 01:16:26.920
There is some other information and then we are 460 then we are at

794
01:16:28.520 --> 01:16:33.960
and [music]

795
01:16:34.159 --> 01:16:42.159
M It is then a little brief this with doing things before what knows about D so

796
01:16:42.159 --> 01:16:48.239
If the question is in the middle, the lawyer now finds yes eh so it is about

797
01:16:48.239 --> 01:16:53.840
that Leon would have received money type 300 kr

798
01:16:53.840 --> 01:16:59.560
similar but then the question comes then was Leon who told you he

799
01:16:59.560 --> 01:17:05.840
received money then the answer is the police recorded no it was hamko hambko said that

800
01:17:05.840 --> 01:17:12.920
Leon took food money and went yes the day after I believed it was mm just that okay

801
01:17:12.920 --> 01:17:19.960
So that is true anyway mm yes but then so

802
01:17:21.000 --> 01:17:26.840
eh then there is another task here on the same Tem as you then said that you

803
01:17:26.840 --> 01:17:31.880
had not received any information from Hamk about what Leon had done for

804
01:17:31.880 --> 01:17:34.880
anything

805
01:17:35.000 --> 01:17:43.600
eh and then it is on p 465 and st for the middle about a conversation

01:29:01.199 --> 01:29:06.199
were something those with some gun m that he would get a gun but I don't know

916
01:29:06.199 --> 01:29:12.480
so there no why would he get some gun as it knows it didn't hang together

917
01:29:12.480 --> 01:29:17.360
with the fact that he would step as you had received I do not know but what usually man

918
01:29:17.360 --> 01:29:24.280
do with a gun yes you usually shoot people with them after but that I don't

919
01:29:24.280 --> 01:29:29.840
say I know it yes no one has said m that he is going to shoot me no but yes it

920
01:29:29.840 --> 01:29:34.320
was something with him to get a gun etc. yes but I understand and how

921
01:29:34.320 --> 01:29:38.360
will s that then you want it to send a video on this then yes I want to

922
01:29:38.360 --> 01:29:44.320
see it mm and why do you want to see it so I was just curious curious

923
01:29:44.320 --> 01:29:47.639
Mm just

924
01:29:48.560 --> 01:29:54.080
Then we have the event then

925
01:29:54.840 --> 01:29:57.719
this with the fact that there will be problems with the train

926
01:29:57.719 --> 01:30:03.080
Yes where it helped him but then we have time here now it is on p 108 but it has

927
01:30:03.080 --> 01:30:10.080
Go 1446 Prime Crime DS but you but you think

928
01:30:10.080 --> 01:30:14.360
self that you helped Leon in that situation so to come yes exactly I helped he

929
01:30:14.360 --> 01:30:20.159
toe But I didn't know any crime would be committed no no but exactly

930
01:30:20.159 --> 01:30:25.239
Eh it is so that he gets stressed so experience reaching stress yes exactly for him

931
01:30:25.239 --> 01:30:29.760
did not have much battery on their phone how else is it with Leon small

932
01:30:29.760 --> 01:30:36.000
perception is he is easily stressed so he a calm person otherwise he

933
01:30:36.000 --> 01:30:41.400
is a calm or he like keeps everything within him he is not so much outward no

934
01:30:41.400 --> 01:30:47.080
he I experience he as a calm person like that but when things like become becomes

935
01:30:47.080 --> 01:30:51.560
hard time he gets stressed then I feel calm even those situations yes I

936
01:30:51.560 --> 01:30:57.600
Believe calm or stressed I am stressed then

937
01:30:57.600 --> 01:31:00.159
Yes, okay

938
01:31:01.320 --> 01:31:07.760
Yes yes so help him with this then

939
01:31:11.880 --> 01:31:16.679
Eh just like that then it's something we can't see here because you get asked it

940
01:31:16.679 --> 01:31:24.199
is on page 109 from Leon for question 16 2957 what do you do at the police

941
01:31:24.199 --> 01:31:32.440
Yeah what is that something yes i walked by yes yes i would eh go home to

942
01:31:32.440 --> 01:31:37.719
my friend etc. and to get there if you go from eh where Leon lives so you have to go

943
01:31:37.719 --> 01:31:43.440
past the police house, etc. and how did he know about it when he saw me at

Was in Ã–rebro but I thought he was going to Stockholm etc. Yes just that

954
01:32:38.880 --> 01:32:42.000
Did you think so even when he sat the car

Mm but you are still friends so you were Leon yes

985
01:35:49.440 --> 01:35:54.440
yes, like his friend could not tell him that it was very bad idea

986
01:35:54.440 --> 01:35:59.400
to do this what you do d you this I said that he is constantly in three

987
01:35:59.400 --> 01:36:05.239
weeks maybe mm yes late when he chose to go then I

988
01:36:05.239 --> 01:36:12.040
couldn't what should I say yes when he was on the way does not

989
01:36:12.040 --> 01:36:18.080
For example, yes but I said it first yes etc. I understand but now now now turns still

990
01:36:18.080 --> 01:36:22.199
Know like that now it is like this, still seriously this now now says in all

991
01:36:22.199 --> 01:36:28.040
fall self to do something yes

992
01:36:34.000 --> 01:36:40.400
No then just after this then he replies to your question film then

993
01:36:40.400 --> 01:36:46.280
Or yes not when I do it so you can do so where I will cod then write

994
01:36:46.280 --> 01:36:54.400
you 248 no brother s leon joha haaha it will see the news has your reply man

995
01:36:54.400 --> 01:36:58.320
and Ma check what a quick on

996
01:37:00.719 --> 01:37:06.080
cod is this something that is part of the lead to try to make Leon not

997
01:37:06.080 --> 01:37:14.719
well that the abomination what do you mean to be when he writes when I will cod yes

998
01:37:14.719 --> 01:37:22.239
and you serve no brother so it sounds from my side like you were trying to get

999
01:37:22.239 --> 01:37:26.800
him to actually implement, the snare brought he should not do it no I

1000
01:37:26.800 --> 01:37:30.840
didn't want him to implement it no yes yes you said and you said that too

1001
01:37:30.840 --> 01:37:35.360
that you sent notification that he would film for makes the reached stressed then that

1002
01:37:35.360 --> 01:37:40.159
he would fine it I buy but just this message it says I will

1003
01:37:40.159 --> 01:37:46.159
cod and you say v no yes but what I mean that if the police then he was

1004
01:37:46.159 --> 01:37:51.199
afraid that the police saw what we wrote etc. what I mean that if they have already seen

1005
01:37:51.199 --> 01:37:55.280
So he has already coded etc. yes but it will come a little later if you say so

1006
01:37:55.280 --> 01:38:00.199
Also, but in order to, like when breathing, cod, no, it means that

1007
01:38:00.199 --> 01:38:04.920
I perceive all cases as you are trying to encourage to continue but so

1008
01:38:04.920 --> 01:38:10.199
I can't say I don't remember no but I don't think I encourage

1009
01:38:10.199 --> 01:38:15.400
no no but it's ok what I'm just trying to understand how you

1010
01:38:15.400 --> 01:38:19.320
thought I won't try to make it all the opinion but only

1011
01:38:19.320 --> 01:38:24.480
But then so but then this continues after the man and checks what snares at

1012
01:38:24.480 --> 01:38:31.159
cod so continue there then page 112 film only i want to see yes it is

1013
01:38:31.159 --> 01:38:36.639
same as sag to yes so I would like to be stressed

1014
01:38:37.599 --> 01:38:44.840
Mm just that you get any answer then from Leon it does not send to the group

1015
01:38:44.840 --> 01:38:50.080
or something it is between you and me what is it for the group he is talking about then

1016
01:38:50.080 --> 01:38:55.440
No I don't remember this is this signal gray dead everyone and yes it can be

1017
01:38:55.440 --> 01:39:00.679
So I don't remember had you access to what is seen there eh I think I

1018
01:39:00.679 --> 01:39:05.679
was with it at the beginning eh but that I left it fairly quickly as

1019
01:39:05.679 --> 01:39:11.760
I said I regretted etc. eh yes don't think I was in the group at all and n

1020
01:39:11.760 --> 01:39:15.719
When time you think you leave this group then then

1021
01:39:15.719 --> 01:39:21.480
Be the sixth in that case yes okay or so I don't remember which day

1022
01:39:21.480 --> 01:39:26.480
But it was the same day that the tickets booked like me

1023
01:39:26.480 --> 01:39:32.040
just left that okay but yes in before this is now we any case then how

1024
01:39:32.040 --> 01:39:36.560
as a one one taken

1025
01:39:36.960 --> 01:39:44.960
Okay just like that then this then continues this conversation 2150 then with

1026
01:39:44.960 --> 01:39:50.080
Questions from you when they are three they are they are two when you are going to step when do you get

1027
01:39:50.080 --> 01:39:53.440
The money yes

1028
01:39:54.639 --> 01:39:59.760
That's when I was in the group Eh a few days before mm yes that was when I

1029
01:39:59.760 --> 01:40:03.400
saw messages that he would receive money

1030
01:40:03.400 --> 01:40:09.760
Prime crime dse but in this situation so know that leam

1031
01:40:09.760 --> 01:40:16.239
is in Ã–bro anyway what no I think it no okay he had

1032
01:40:16.239 --> 01:40:20.599
not on the snap map I cannot say that if you have gone on or if you

1033
01:40:20.599 --> 01:40:26.639
is left okay but I knew he had gone to Ã–rebro but then I thought that

1034
01:40:26.639 --> 01:40:32.040
he was going to Stockholm etc. Okay not that he would stay no yes just that

1035
01:40:32.040 --> 01:40:40.000
Just that but then eh shall we see where I was

1036
01:40:44.199 --> 01:40:48.440
somewhere when are you going to step when do you get the money

1037
01:40:48.440 --> 01:40:54.400
Yeah i remember being in responding to that

1038
01:40:54.639 --> 01:41:01.080
eh no if they die i get the money yes so have

1039
01:41:01.080 --> 01:41:05.599
you if they can get out it is knit

1040
01:41:05.719 --> 01:41:12.440
Yes what does this mean to you this what what did you think would

1041
01:41:12.440 --> 01:41:16.599
happen so then I know

1042
01:41:18.280 --> 01:41:22.360
Not if they die I get the money means he's going to kill someone maybe it is

1043
01:41:22.360 --> 01:41:26.560
obvious to reach should yes but I don't know was when

1044
01:41:26.560 --> 01:41:34.719
no why no, but that the l who will do it yes the tare he screams it to

1045
01:41:34.719 --> 01:41:40.199
me yes yes but just just

1046
01:41:46.320 --> 01:41:54.920
that yes your answer then yes but hello fog then send themselves to film

1047
01:41:54.920 --> 01:42:02.119
it again then film yes the same cause as before yes

1048
01:42:11.599 --> 01:42:20.159
M Then this appears this I send at 2208 here now since it is at

1049
01:42:20.159 --> 01:42:25.280
73 yes but where are you sent twice what is

1050
01:42:25.280 --> 01:42:31.159
It then yes but what is it then it says how I should film but that's the time

1051
01:42:31.159 --> 01:42:37.320
Two I will do it yes and what is it to do then it is like people

1052
01:42:37.320 --> 01:42:42.800
Will die me now yes exactly yes just

1053
01:42:42.960 --> 01:42:45.960
the

1054
01:42:48.440 --> 01:42:54.000
Okay then it appears that he is himself here too no one is going to

1055
01:42:54.000 --> 01:43:01.679
Eh i i think like this now eh it's hard of course but you feel after all

1056
01:43:01.679 --> 01:43:07.040
Leon etc. he has really good yes he has gone up to higher brother then for

1057
01:43:07.040 --> 01:43:13.760
that as it seems then killing someone or more people

1058
01:43:14.280 --> 01:43:21.920
ehm how do you think he is still affected by the contacts that you have it I

1059
01:43:21.920 --> 01:43:27.719
did not think about at all but cases when he is alone in a city that for F may that he

1060
01:43:27.719 --> 01:43:32.119
lonely he is alone in a city yes that he does not live in.

1061
01:43:32.119 --> 01:43:37.239
crime and so he still has a friend with him on the phone with whom you have contact with

1062
01:43:37.239 --> 01:43:42.560
front and back yes it is a stress factor for hono that

1063
01:43:42.560 --> 01:43:45.840
could be able to abstain from doing this you think or you think that yes

1064
01:43:45.840 --> 01:43:52.080
But it is perhaps a support for her yes I do not know he told me that

1065
01:43:52.080 --> 01:43:58.920
he would go home okay yes when did he say it then i miss not

1066
01:43:58.920 --> 01:44:05.560
i miss i woke up at night he called me yes okay

1067
01:44:05.560 --> 01:44:11.719
okay mm but while as n those with the contacts now still so you don't know about

1068
01:44:11.719 --> 01:44:17.320
man if you were a support for him or no so I I am barely anything

1069
01:44:17.320 --> 01:44:23.400
From that night I was very affected so I can't say no

1070
01:44:23.400 --> 01:44:27.520
If I serve that I remember then I lie etc.

1071
01:44:27.520 --> 01:44:33.119
Absolutely, but if I now claim like this then that if under the circumstances that

1072
01:44:33.119 --> 01:44:38.000
I have told us about now foreign city we have gone very serious crime that one has

1073
01:44:38.000 --> 01:44:44.560
that friend on the phone then contact that does not allocate but more a support

1074
01:44:44.560 --> 01:44:48.360
So there l with a little more of windows but still there is then I would probably

1075
01:44:48.360 --> 01:44:52.199
know the person that it was a support for me you think I deviate from it

1076
01:44:52.199 --> 01:44:57.760
that is normal when I reason like that or do I sound reasonable so I understood

1077
01:44:57.760 --> 01:45:04.800
not the question no I try to think into Leon's situation where yes no thus

1078
01:45:04.800 --> 01:45:09.599
The idea behind why I wrote so it was that he would be stressed and regret

1079
01:45:09.599 --> 01:45:14.040
Yes it wasn't that I would help him okay because you may know that I sew

1080
01:45:14.040 --> 01:45:17.920
To the applicant is tuned that they with the contact are a support for Leon Yes I know I know

1081
01:45:17.920 --> 01:45:23.840
Mm okay but that wasn't the idea behind no

1082
01:45:25.440 --> 01:45:31.280
then there is a little more they come brother they will harass you angry anyway on

1083
01:45:31.280 --> 01:45:38.880
the end of page 113 2210 What v What does hazel mean in the context

1084
01:45:38.880 --> 01:45:44.679
deceive yes yes is the money we are talking about then or something else

1085
01:45:44.679 --> 01:45:50.000
Yeah i think that i don't remember

1086
01:45:50.760 --> 01:45:54.840
No I understand

1087
01:45:55.920 --> 01:46:00.960
Then there are some questions since 114 here middle

1088
01:46:00.960 --> 01:46:06.199
-â€”-â€”-

1089
01:46:06.199 --> 01:46:13.719
got gasoline or something yes sit man weaker then yes he answers

1090
01:46:13.719 --> 01:46:20.040
gasoline yes yes exactly yes v so your what you answer

1091
01:46:20.040 --> 01:46:27.080
on this so I said something that he would show etc. yes yes I was

1092
01:46:27.080 --> 01:46:31.480
curious exactly what you were

1093
01:46:32.880 --> 01:46:40.199
curious just like that then he sends to you 22 23 I'll leave two packages

1094
01:46:40.199 --> 01:46:43.280
strawberry outside to mock the strawberry you

1095
01:46:43.280 --> 01:46:47.520
know what do you think about it then the whole bit

1096
01:46:47.520 --> 01:46:50.880
yes I know

1097
01:46:51.840 --> 01:46:56.480
Not because I guess yes then you will be so S that if I am wrong because I guess that

1098
01:46:56.480 --> 01:47:00.080
Yet have had some control over this bunch of conflict with shootings and beds

1099
01:47:00.080 --> 01:47:06.320
and the like with the strawberry and fox and yes so I do not have very much

1100
01:47:06.320 --> 01:47:11.920

1104
01:47:27.840 --> 01:47:31.000

1105
01:47:31.000 --> 01:47:36.199
The actors I didn't think okay

Laughed yes

1109

That's right

1110
01:47:59.880 --> 01:48:07.800
It then if we continue 115 then Leon will be spruce a little spruce where they are located

Yes yes H may a her organist and such a yes h had you reach you had any calls or

1112
01:48:15.760 --> 01:48:19.679
something during this period is in then obviously one

1113
01:48:19.679 --> 01:48:27.199
apartment eh i remember he e send a picture on on

1114
01:48:27.199 --> 01:48:32.599
Someone on the couch where he was in the light was the picture that I showed

01:48:37.560 --> 01:48:42.280
You saw the whole sofa you saw the whole sof okay yes though it was kind of the same picture

1117
01:48:42.280 --> 01:48:51.920
Although it was dark yes yes okay I understand

1118
01:48:55.080 --> 01:49:01.560
But since then 2247 here you asked but brother should not light no no brother sar

1119
01:49:01.560 --> 01:49:06.920
leen v gets the case today no i get the case i know

1120
01:49:06.920 --> 01:49:12.679
not yes I just ask yes because it sounds a little spruce that is like trying to

1121
01:49:12.679 --> 01:49:16.800
pushes him to do this anyway, but why did nothing happen why do

1122
01:49:16.800 --> 01:49:20.880
So I didn't push I just asked he yes I wanted so I wanted to know

1123
01:49:20.880 --> 01:49:27.800
What happens I was worried about Leon yes yes I can understand yes so I wanted to

1124
01:49:27.800 --> 01:49:33.679
Like knowing what happens yes so we actually see it there

1125
01:49:33.679 --> 01:49:41.960
Also the last there when 2248 you will be horned so horned tr but cheated yes yes

1126

Yes then further forward a little time here then

1128
01:49:51.639 --> 01:49:57.480
or 16 so do you ask when should you do it

1129
01:49:57.480 --> 01:50:02.119
Shouldn't you shoot someone yes so that is a little wrong

1130
01:50:02.119 --> 01:50:09.000
St my interpretation so s i will do it at two when

1131
01:50:09.560 --> 01:50:18.239
Depending yes where you get the money forget about movie

1132
01:50:18.239 --> 01:50:23.000
What is the last thing that really happened here

1133
01:50:23.000 --> 01:50:29.360
Yes in the evening v you had any call or something after this then no I

1134
01:50:29.360 --> 01:50:35.560
don't think so no no no i should not forget the answers on

1135
01:50:35.560 --> 01:50:40.719
the question to film and film the same as before or yes he said

1136
01:50:40.719 --> 01:50:46.880

1137
01:50:46.880 --> 01:50:54.679

1138
01:50:54.679 --> 01:51:00.360

1141
01:51:09.079 --> 01:51:13.079

1145
01:51:33.719 --> 01:51:38.159

1146
01:51:38.159 --> 01:51:43.719
On on regular sms I think or if it was sneak mm I wrote to his people

1147
01:51:43.719 --> 01:51:47.679
Saying you are arrested when I was shocked that he was arrested when I thought has

1148
01:51:47.679 --> 01:51:51.079
he did it or not yes exactly what he said he was going home that he was not

1149
01:51:51.079 --> 01:51:55.119
would make it okay because you said before h I asked two

times at least that you do not contact with after 2338 yes you but we

1160
01:52:55.480 --> 01:53:00.199

Eh but i don't know why i took screenshot if i should be honest no

1162
01:53:08.000 --> 01:53:13.159
okay right there late

1163
01:53:13.159 --> 01:53:18.159
so do you have sometime during time here now

1164
01:53:18.159 --> 01:53:24.840
Leon went on the train until you know that it is arrested you have

1165
01:53:24.840 --> 01:53:29.639
been in contact with the police or something

1166
01:53:29.639 --> 01:53:37.520
No and why don't you have it because e or what do you mean to

1167
01:53:37.520 --> 01:53:42.400
mean that you have found out of gradually but do you have the same the same

1168
01:53:42.400 --> 01:53:49.440
day he went or yes but if s yes exactly but f thought he ate at least i

1169
01:53:49.440 --> 01:53:53.960
had for with the police the day after yes but just yes it was when I told you everything

1170
01:53:53.960 --> 01:53:58.440
I know yes but then you knew that len said you were yes I read it on

1171
01:53:58.440 --> 01:54:03.360
The news yes exactly but I think so before Lean gets arrested when he like

1172
01:54:03.360 --> 01:54:09.280
have then gone off by the train and when it is ready for it then gradually that he

1173
01:54:09.280 --> 01:54:15.400
scolded a whole fucking apartment and similar that people will die

1174
01:54:15.400 --> 01:54:19.920
Yes why don't you contact the police then because I don't want people to go

1175
01:54:19.920 --> 01:54:27.920
To my gate and blast my gate no yes and contact the police anonymously then no

1176
01:54:27.920 --> 01:54:34.440
I didn't think about it no wasn't thinking about it no dde you at all

1177
01:54:34.440 --> 01:54:37.560
about what would happen to people that it was the idea that people would

1178
01:54:37.560 --> 01:54:45.520
die i didn't think so much no because it's still pretty badly thinking

1179
01:54:45.520 --> 01:54:52.520
If people put life into as well as yes etc.

1180
01:54:52.639 --> 01:54:56.560
Then there is actually an obligation to do this that if one now gets

1181
01:54:56.560 --> 01:55:00.480
knowledge that a seriously a very serious crime that is committed has

1182
01:55:00.480 --> 01:55:06.159
man an obligation as well as eh reveal this r actually

1183
01:55:06.159 --> 01:55:12.000
Yeah i have been expelled because i don't want people to go to my gate burst

1184
01:55:12.000 --> 01:55:18.639
my gate or kill me m yes since i didn't know one could be anonymous

1185
01:55:20.280 --> 01:55:25.320
No ok but about me but i but i about i

1186
01:55:25.320 --> 01:55:28.880
perceive that it is right here so you simply ignored it because you thought

1187
01:55:28.880 --> 01:55:32.560
that it is important that you yourself are safe

1188
01:55:32.679 --> 01:55:38.800
Then he had a little yes exactly mm yes plus he said he would he regretted

1189
01:55:38.800 --> 01:55:42.199

1190
01:55:42.199 --> 01:55:49.280
This one with Leon saying he was going home yes

1191
01:55:49.280 --> 01:55:56.639

1192
01:55:56.639 --> 01:56:00.040
have said that no one has asked the question I think it is important that it will

1193
01:56:00.040 --> 01:56:05.960
forward here in court yes yes it is not that you try to protect Leon simply

1194
01:56:05.960 --> 01:56:11.960

02:02:46.880 --> 02:02:53.239
is that you have helped with his journey eh what did you know what he would be Ã¶rebro

1257
02:02:53.239 --> 02:02:58.480
And yes I believed he was going to Stockholm yes that was what he himself too

1258
02:02:58.480 --> 02:03:06.079
Thought yes eh but first took BLETT to Ã–rebro etc. mm

1259
02:03:06.079 --> 02:03:12.000
and then reason you help him with how to change and s and so eh what

1260
02:03:12.000 --> 02:03:15.840
did you say it was eh he had a little battery and I experienced he as

1261
02:03:15.840 --> 02:03:23.760
stressed etc. so it was only to be able to travel by train to Ã–rebro helped

1262
02:03:24.239 --> 02:03:27.239
mm

1263
02:03:29.719 --> 02:03:36.400
eh if we then look at these calls and as prosecutors

1264
02:03:36.400 --> 02:03:40.960
have gone through pretty unlucky now with

1265
02:03:42.679 --> 02:03:50.159
you v what prosecution mean here that you would have

1266
02:03:50.159 --> 02:03:57.360
encouraged him what is your thought when you talk to

1267
02:03:57.360 --> 02:04:05.000
him or writes with him fast s you said on prosecution question that you wanted to do

1268
02:04:05.000 --> 02:04:09.280
him stressed so he would not do anything

1269
02:04:09.280 --> 02:04:14.760
Without him would wonder

1270
02:04:14.760 --> 02:04:22.000
mm is your purpose as you think so you how long h you

1271
02:04:22.000 --> 02:04:28.559
And Leon Rust clearly acquainted and so there you had a good contact Johan so we

1272
02:04:28.559 --> 02:04:34.840
have not known each other for so long maybe two months max two three months yes yes

1273
02:04:34.840 --> 02:04:40.559
But then you have been hanging out of slippery time so we were with each other type every day yes so

1274
02:04:40.559 --> 02:04:43.800
you had had a good

1275
02:04:48.000 --> 02:04:53.480
relationship you eh thought too

1276
02:04:53.480 --> 02:05:03.960
on you were quite long time that went when Leon Rusk pondered on this he had

1277
02:05:03.960 --> 02:05:08.960
received this offer to step for even how long

1278
02:05:08.960 --> 02:05:18.480
about you think he talks about it one to three weeks etc. reach so and what was

1279
02:05:18.480 --> 02:05:25.239
your v hara you him and what do you think during these this time then I have

1280
02:05:25.239 --> 02:05:32.159
said he is not worth making it no you advised so way etc. mm and it was

1281
02:05:32.159 --> 02:05:41.559
every day he asked so he does and so don't

1282
02:05:41.920 --> 02:05:47.119
Mm you and then you yourself when

1283
02:05:47.119 --> 02:05:53.760
you man words a train ticket we have seen here eh eh to you you can just tell

1284
02:05:53.760 --> 02:06:00.280
briefly how it turned out it was you asked for a tret no i didn't pray for a toet

1285
02:06:00.280 --> 02:06:10.079
Eh but the idea was that I first made G yes how long eh it a maximum of 30

1286
02:06:10.079 --> 02:06:15.679
minutes an hour maybe after I said no I regretted so that it is a

1287
02:06:15.679 --> 02:06:24.000
half -hour hour as you first say and then you arrange with tet yes eh but they

1288
02:06:24.000 --> 02:06:29.079
I said it before they bought TB mm and they bought TB after I said I didn't

1289
02:06:29.079 --> 02:06:35.559
wanted yes but it was never used then no

1290
02:06:35.559 --> 02:06:41.639
Eh you yes we have seen in the conversation here at

1291
02:06:41.639 --> 02:06:47.320
that he was asked to bring as many friends as possible

1292
02:06:47.320 --> 02:06:55.520
Mm, there were more people who became when what you know, so people do not know about it but

1293
02:06:55.520 --> 02:07:00.400
not that they were offered etc. how many people thought it was who knew about it

1294
02:07:00.400 --> 02:07:07.400
Here I don't know quite a few but I can't say exact number no but 10

1295
02:07:07.400 --> 02:07:14.559
20 30 Yes but maybe F 10 had too

1296
02:07:14.559 --> 02:07:21.520
got iBand or eh I can't say that I don't know

1297
02:07:21.520 --> 02:07:26.679
feeling at least they knew it but not that they were allowed to offer

1298
02:07:26.679 --> 02:07:29.679
No

1299
02:07:32.440 --> 02:07:37.480
m you you see there too in these

1300
02:07:37.480 --> 02:07:42.559
the conversations and as the prosecutor has gone through here usually the analysis

1301
02:07:42.559 --> 02:07:49.480
eh you talk if you talk about weapons and you wanted a picture of the weapon and

1302
02:07:49.480 --> 02:07:55.760
said the revolver eh yes what what did you really know

1303
02:07:55.760 --> 02:08:00.280
you had he said that now I will have revolver and now I will

1304
02:08:00.280 --> 02:08:06.480
burn v do you get it from v no one has told him he is going to do

1305
02:08:06.480 --> 02:08:10.079
No that is what he thought he would do but no one has told him he

1306
02:08:10.079 --> 02:08:14.400
would do it was just speculation yes so he didn't know either he knew

1307
02:08:14.400 --> 02:08:17.400
not

1308
02:08:24.960 --> 02:08:33.119
After all, you hear here we have seen the first time on October 8 by the police etc. and

1309
02:08:33.119 --> 02:08:41.599
Then you are referred to witness yes etc. and then you told you that there was something

1310
02:08:41.599 --> 02:08:48.920
split for the fox yes yes but yes the police do not perceive anything

1311
02:08:48.920 --> 02:08:54.639
more about that then you are not heard for one and you are entirely on the loose between

1312
02:08:54.639 --> 02:09:01.760
October 8 and November 17 when you are arrested yes etc.

1313
02:09:01.760 --> 02:09:06.559
eh you are there many who contact you under it

1314
02:09:06.559 --> 02:09:13.280
the time or trying about what then or yes about everything about what you know about it and

1315
02:09:13.280 --> 02:09:18.760
what has happened and or do you contact some no it is mostly so that

1316
02:09:18.760 --> 02:09:21.960
There were people who under where was somewhere yes

1317
02:09:21.960 --> 02:09:26.960

SmÃ¶gen when I told you what had happened etc. yes type

1319
02:09:31.960 --> 02:09:38.079
So it was in the newspapers pretty quickly yes there were quite a few who found out

1320
02:09:38.079 --> 02:09:41.880
that without them contacted me too

1321
02:09:42.000 --> 02:09:52.079
Yes but then you will be eg here on November 17 then and he

1322
02:09:52.079 --> 02:09:58.360

he could use my what is called snapchat go in and adds from there so i gave

1411
02:17:56.920 --> 02:18:01.760
him the code also to my old snap and then when it comes to this to

1412
02:18:01.760 --> 02:18:05.519
one has shown that I have written to any girl on instagram that I sent

1413
02:18:05.519 --> 02:18:09.000
to her my old snap I have sent so I sent her my

1414
02:18:09.000 --> 02:18:13.240
old snap because I don't want to give her my what is the new snap then on

1415
02:18:13.240 --> 02:18:18.080
new snap I have only so few people who are familiar and so not as before I

1416
02:18:18.080 --> 02:18:22.479
had kind of 500 people people I didn't know and so yes on the new snap I

1417
02:18:22.479 --> 02:18:26.280
had only people I knew and my girlfriend then and my girlfriend she has what

1418
02:18:26.280 --> 02:18:30.200
is it called access to she has read the north to my new snap so she usually

1419
02:18:30.200 --> 02:18:34.000
Go through my new snap and check if I write with other girls and stuff like that

1420
02:18:34.000 --> 02:18:37.800
When h where the girl asked about my snap I sent this one my old one in case

1421
02:18:37.800 --> 02:18:41.760
and I ask why I didn't send my new and thus just old it was

1422
02:18:41.760 --> 02:18:45.240
That's why I sent old for my girl usually go through my snab and check for

1423
02:18:45.240 --> 02:18:48.160
I write with other girls and I usually use my old snap myself

1424
02:18:48.160 --> 02:18:51.399
So then when I usually go in write with other girls and since I have too

1425
02:18:51.399 --> 02:18:56.160
formed on my old snap that I usually go in and so use this yes try

1426
02:18:56.160 --> 02:19:01.479
Get hold of yes then when it comes to this crime so I knew

1427
02:19:01.479 --> 02:19:04.200
nothing about this I had nothing with this to do it was then it

1428
02:19:04.200 --> 02:19:11.399
the day after l voice was arrested when I got a call time in the morning such as

1429
02:19:11.399 --> 02:19:15.559
Man showed at 09 something I don't remember exactly but yes I got

1430
02:19:15.559 --> 02:19:20.719
A call of a number that had not saved on my phone so I replied

1431
02:19:20.719 --> 02:19:25.000
I asked what is the name of the person I just who is it and since it was Leon

1432
02:19:25.000 --> 02:19:28.679
alkri who died he said it was he since I was quick to ask i just what

1433
02:19:28.679 --> 02:19:33.639
How did you get my number and what do you want when he said he got to take on my number

1434
02:19:33.639 --> 02:19:37.240
by signal for one can see on the signal of others' persons number it is

1435
02:19:37.240 --> 02:19:40.599
As you can see what you don't have to ask the app itself to get information

1436
02:19:40.599 --> 02:19:45.960
There is, like you, you show for all the number so it is from there he received

1437
02:19:45.960 --> 02:19:50.399
My number he said and since he asked if I knew if R had been arrested so

1438
02:19:50.399 --> 02:19:54.520
I so no I knew nothing for the last time I had contact with rck it was

1439
02:19:54.520 --> 02:19:59.120
When we were placed at home together and I had him on my

1440
02:19:59.120 --> 02:20:02.439
old snap and I didn't have him on my new one then so I usually have contact with

1441
02:20:02.439 --> 02:20:08.080
him since too i have not h his phone number on someone else on

1442
02:20:08.080 --> 02:20:11.520
somewhere else on social media and to add people on what is it called

1443
02:20:11.520 --> 02:20:15.120
signal so you need phone numbers and i don't have h his

1444
02:20:15.120 --> 02:20:21.359
phone number then eh what is it called eh wait what was it yes explained that

1445
02:20:21.359 --> 02:20:25.200
With Signal Snapchat then what is it exactly called then what is it called this

1446
02:20:25.200 --> 02:20:29.000
the call when we didn't talk so long so it was max type f minutes or

1447
02:20:29.000 --> 02:20:34.120
Two minutes so on this conversation we what is called then he said he was alfredsson

1448
02:20:34.120 --> 02:20:38.040
he asked if I knew then where n r was as I said since I said that we

1449
02:20:38.040 --> 02:20:43.439
had contact then on v as I then said exactly yes what was this let me

1450
02:20:43.439 --> 02:20:46.840
remember yes exactly he asked if i knew since i told him now i knew

1451
02:20:46.840 --> 02:20:50.960
not for s go i had contact with him it was at hb home since he ask

1452
02:20:50.960 --> 02:20:53.479
So if I knew anything about this crime so I just no since I

1453
02:20:53.479 --> 02:20:56.960
So didn't believe myself I didn't even believe this that the guy had coded

1454
02:20:56.960 --> 02:21:00.520
for something or if he has done something so he only you can check

1455
02:21:00.520 --> 02:21:05.120
Internet search for it so I searched that picture from then what is it called

1456
02:21:05.120 --> 02:21:09.439
The article on my phone man has found out what is it called telephone emptying it is

1457
02:21:09.439 --> 02:21:13.960
from there eh I have the picture from what is the name of the act itself and

1458
02:21:13.960 --> 02:21:17.280
the one from there I saw that it was enon person who had been what is it called

1459
02:21:17.280 --> 02:21:22.840
arrested for general fuel when it was the present that was then for I

1460
02:21:22.840 --> 02:21:26.319
didn't even know what it means so i didn't think so much about it after

1461
02:21:26.319 --> 02:21:31.160
I loos on I don't know if it was right after or later in the day then

1462
02:21:31.160 --> 02:21:36.359
Because Leon Alfredsson told me this with that my number through signal then

1463
02:21:36.359 --> 02:21:41.000
I wanted to check so I downloaded signal on my phone and I wrote my

1464
02:21:41.000 --> 02:21:44.800
number i tried to log in m it did not go i think it might be so that

1465
02:21:44.800 --> 02:21:48.600
the person using the account thus linked to my number either he

1466
02:21:48.600 --> 02:21:52.439
has changed number or so he is called it deleted the account for it was not possible to

1467
02:21:52.439 --> 02:21:55.680
Login I don't know why or if there was anything else I have no one

1468
02:21:55.680 --> 02:21:59.399
Enter so I didn't think much about it that is why there is spore on my

1469
02:21:59.399 --> 02:22:08.040
Phone thus on the signal app then if what is called then wonders yes then when it

1470
02:22:08.040 --> 02:22:12.080
applies to these pictures that have been owed to eh in this picture of myself

1471
02:22:12.080 --> 02:22:18.080
where there is an r emoji an r emoji this picture it is taken on August 1st

1472
02:22:18.080 --> 02:22:22.000
You can see the date is up there if you check the time for prosecutors have posted to

1473
02:22:22.000 --> 02:22:26.240
it must have been created October 8th though it is not true it may be that I

1474
02:22:26.240 --> 02:22:29.560
took screenshot on October 8 in the picture itself but the picture itself has already

1475
02:22:29.560 --> 02:22:34.280
Been finished and posted on August 1st so why I have emojis thus

1476
02:22:34.280 --> 02:22:38.080
It was just an emoji I chose I have nothing with this conflict that

1477
02:22:38.080 --> 02:22:40.800
do or what gang I so I do not even belong to this conflict

1478
02:22:40.800 --> 02:22:45.359
or fst and so small have said I do not want to be involved in that

1479
02:22:45.359 --> 02:22:49.960
So I would not show to people that I belong to any network o so

1480
02:22:49.960 --> 02:22:54.760
because people would see that where it would hit me my family and so

1481
02:22:54.760 --> 02:22:58.280
Why should I show myself and r emoji the only thing I thought about I wanted to

1482
02:22:58.280 --> 02:23:02.240
only part joint i had in hand because i have v nam named family members on

1483
02:23:02.240 --> 02:23:07.319
Instagram so I put this emojin by the hand as you see in the picture it is there

1484
02:23:07.319 --> 02:23:10.439
I do not let it be so that I will be over my head or somewhere and

1485
02:23:10.439 --> 02:23:15.800
so like sinol I am going to be at hand because part jint had in hand and then

1486
02:23:15.800 --> 02:23:20.160
These other pictures then on Benzema and what is it called and what is it called

1487
02:23:20.160 --> 02:23:25.080
from the barrel conflicts but there were pictures you see clearly these

1488
02:23:25.080 --> 02:23:28.760
pictures they are taken from instagram and tictok there are no pictures like

1489
02:23:28.760 --> 02:23:32.080
people have sent to me and as I feel as I said I have no connection

1490
02:23:32.080 --> 02:23:37.240
to folkrot or any other k network these images they are taken from tiktok and

1491
02:23:37.240 --> 02:23:41.319
What is it called Instagram it from social media and you see it too

1492
02:23:41.319 --> 02:23:45.520
Look at the picture so then why I have it just on

1493
02:23:45.520 --> 02:23:48.640
My phone It is no wonder, so almost all young people in the whole of Sweden have

1494
02:23:48.640 --> 02:23:51.880
It on your phone and you follow what you read on news every day

1495
02:23:51.880 --> 02:23:56.160
What happens in Sweden thus this wave of violence then that e gates are blown up and

1496
02:23:56.160 --> 02:24:00.279
So like and I follow myself this conflict I have so I have yes

1497
02:24:00.279 --> 02:24:04.160
A little control over it not so much but I usually follow it on social media

1498
02:24:04.160 --> 02:24:08.680
Because it is rapping and so as is involved I usually listen to this one

1499
02:24:08.680 --> 02:24:15.399
the rapper I usually follow it so that's why I have it on my phone and yes late

1500
02:24:15.399 --> 02:24:18.319
It was also another I wanted to comment on that was this with that

1501
02:24:18.319 --> 02:24:23.200
Prosecutor he called the police Morgan what is it called regarding this

1502
02:24:23.200 --> 02:24:28.000

1506
02:24:39.840 --> 02:24:44.080
The bus to school when I didn't know the police had saved but they had spam

1507
02:24:44.080 --> 02:24:47.760
on me they did not seize me outside the gate or so they followed me all the way

1508
02:24:47.760 --> 02:24:52.520
without me noticing to the bu station well there when i was well the bus d

1509

02:25:12.120 --> 02:25:15.920
So it's tv hurt I scream I just e letting go I turn I didn't know

1515

1520
02:25:35.920 --> 02:25:40.319
He thought what the hell is H about since then h only we are police officers we are police officers

1521
02:25:40.319 --> 02:25:44.040
Then when they noticed people started coming to put me in the car where I asked them to

1524
02:25:52.840 --> 02:25:56.800
there is something now in the car you will see you will see for times worse this so

1525
02:25:56.800 --> 02:25:59.439
I just won't do anything I did nothing since they pulled that one

1526
02:25:59.439 --> 02:26:02.160
the card yes you resist even though it made no resistance they jump on me

1527
02:26:02.160 --> 02:26:05.720
from nowhere so it was just the had you say and one to the thing I will

1528
02:26:05.720 --> 02:26:10.439
Continue also be quiet I do not know what is it called eh will be quiet

1529
02:26:10.439 --> 02:26:14.800
Prosecutors can ask their questions and then I also know that this is serious

1530
02:26:14.800 --> 02:26:17.760
So brat as I suspected why not wanting to mention this person

1531
02:26:17.760 --> 02:26:22.040
who have to my snapchat and number so i don't want names in him

1532
02:26:22.040 --> 02:26:25.200
Because you know for yourself what it is, so it is nothing strange with the people they

1533
02:26:25.200 --> 02:26:28.720
get shot they get dead they get blasted for such things to be named

1534
02:26:28.720 --> 02:26:32.240
or man b out any person i don't want to get involved in anything i have

1535
02:26:32.240 --> 02:26:35.600
not with this conflict to do or reach some of the crime that

1536
02:26:35.600 --> 02:26:39.160
do I don't want to expose my family to proceed so I hope you understand and

1537
02:26:39.160 --> 02:26:44.359
respect what I will not name that person or any other yes is

1538
02:26:44.359 --> 02:26:51.120
Clearly thank you so much then prosecution should be given the opportunity to ask questions here etc. Thank you

1539
02:26:51.120 --> 02:26:56.800
The hello I was just thinking about asking you first you have during the police interrogations that held

1540
02:26:56.800 --> 02:27:02.399
with you exploited your right not to answer any questions or

1541
02:27:02.399 --> 02:27:08.240
How it is totally okay that you don't say anything but go I have to get

1542
02:27:08.240 --> 02:27:13.600
Asking Questions R St question is true that it does not say on

1543
02:27:13.600 --> 02:27:16.800
some questions on Len if you don't want to comment so you can just say none

1544
02:27:16.800 --> 02:27:20.359
comment can no no i will keep being quiet on yes okay yeah okay

1545
02:27:20.359 --> 02:27:25.359
So you are not going to answer that question now yes but on f may ask questions and about Ham

1546
02:27:25.359 --> 02:27:30.319
is quiet so may ask the next question simply reach well then then we run on it it is

1547
02:27:30.319 --> 02:27:35.720
No problem I noted as I said was that you in the police chose not to answer

1548
02:27:35.720 --> 02:27:41.120
some questions and you have now left a story today about your attitude toward

1549
02:27:41.120 --> 02:27:46.600
The different parts that you are added to load are because you have chosen to customize

1550
02:27:46.600 --> 02:27:50.640
it after the police investigation when it ends in life so you know what answers

1551
02:27:50.640 --> 02:27:54.560
suits you best as you do

1552
02:27:57.560 --> 02:28:01.880
So when it comes to [music]

1553
02:28:01.880 --> 02:28:07.279
eh why do you leave no comments during the police investigation it was because

1554
02:28:07.279 --> 02:28:11.920
you planned from the beginning that it adapted to

1555
02:28:13.160 --> 02:28:19.279
the investigation the telephone number that ends at 65 99 to telephone that was taken

1556
02:28:19.279 --> 02:28:22.720

this

1563
02:29:03.640 --> 02:29:08.359
signal contact that had borrowed

1564
02:29:13.359 --> 02:29:17.479
the telephone number about the explanation for the loan of

1565
02:29:17.479 --> 02:29:22.880
Signal Contact Phone Number Tie as to why he then needs to borrow

1566
02:29:22.880 --> 02:29:26.720
borrow the snap account as well where one does not have that type of eligibility requirement in order to

1567
02:29:26.720 --> 02:29:31.240
able to use snap you have to even e a phone this

1570
02:29:50.240 --> 02:29:55.240
chat traffic that then this unknown friend would have committed

1571
02:29:55.240 --> 02:29:58.240
or lied behind it there is a shovel in your

1572
02:29:58.240 --> 02:30:04.279
phone which then not which then not the conversations

1573
02:30:04.279 --> 02:30:09.200
do if it is now that it is not you who used

1574
02:30:09.200 --> 02:30:13.640
the one we will come to these two accounts

1575
02:30:13.640 --> 02:30:16.399
used in parallel with each other with the same

1576
02:30:16.399 --> 02:30:22.920
content thus in large parts that is, both your signal button

1577
02:30:22.920 --> 02:30:26.840
Chat account is involved in the same conversations including the fact that reveal

1578
02:30:26.840 --> 02:30:32.439
Kill everyone and with Leon Alfredsson where one deals with that

1579
02:30:32.439 --> 02:30:38.720
upcoming deeds to happen and after event it will be it coming

1580
02:30:38.720 --> 02:30:44.120
itself that your phone is physically located with data traffic to Bengtsfors where you

1581
02:30:44.120 --> 02:30:48.040
written while I conversations happen although it is then

1582
02:30:48.040 --> 02:30:51.920
Late at night in the morning

1583
02:30:58.479 --> 02:31:04.680
If you have now used another Snapchat account which account have you used

1584
02:31:05.240 --> 02:31:11.680
then and how can you disclose a snapchat account to another person in that way

1585
02:31:11.680 --> 02:31:15.600
do not want to reach some kind of security regarding your own

1586
02:31:15.600 --> 02:31:19.880
Conversations your contacts

1587
02:31:20.040 --> 02:31:25.800
Although an old account which contacts did you have with Leon

1588
02:31:25.800 --> 02:31:29.120
Rustic at HVBhemmet

1589
02:31:30.279 --> 02:31:35.920
the conversation with Leon Alfsson you have threatened him with some time the same with

1590
02:31:35.920 --> 02:31:43.160
This is that you know where he lives somewhere for the guys to give up on him

1591
02:31:43.160 --> 02:31:47.200
sent his father's old address or

1592
02:31:47.720 --> 02:31:52.920
Similar have reached others who knew had that you had had a conversation

1593
02:31:52.920 --> 02:31:57.240
with Leon Alfredsson so that it is somehow reasonable for someone else

1594
02:31:57.240 --> 02:32:02.640
person could have done this in that case and in that case

1595
02:32:04.040 --> 02:32:08.960
who foxes symbol why do you send it the same

1596
02:32:08.960 --> 02:32:13.520
day if it is so that you send it the same day that the deed would have

1597
02:32:13.520 --> 02:32:19.000
happened why do you say you want to hide a joint where the whole exhaled air

1598
02:32:19.000 --> 02:32:23.760
in front of you of smoke so it is very clearly visible in the picture anyway what you hold on

1599
02:32:23.760 --> 02:32:30.359
with why sitting is straight over the hand

1600
02:32:33.080 --> 02:32:39.520
then it is a coincidence that you wear the fox on you while this goal and they

1601
02:32:39.520 --> 02:32:44.000
conversations that i have on you have sent is about stepping fst fox

1602
02:32:44.000 --> 02:32:48.120
is SL though

1603
02:32:50.200 --> 02:32:53.920
made the objection to the case that you have had no possibility that

1604
02:32:53.920 --> 02:32:59.040
Finance some kind of opportunity then I ask how it will be that 145000

1605
02:32:59.040 --> 02:33:03.479
SEK is taken at home in your apartment formally speaking from your brother the same day

1606
02:33:03.479 --> 02:33:09.240
As new rush wait what did you say SEK 145000 you are taken seized from a brother

1607
02:33:09.240 --> 02:33:14.040
the same day as an h not from him no from

1608
02:33:14.040 --> 02:33:18.720
The brother do you have any explanation for

1609
02:33:18.760 --> 02:33:22.319
that it is thinking about

1610
02:33:24.240 --> 02:33:30.680
go what do you have for you and Leon Alfon for quick contacts after the event itself

1611
02:33:30.680 --> 02:33:34.800
what is documented that it sent

1612
02:33:34.800 --> 02:33:42.240
things these eavesdropped conversations about stepping and that hungs have to gather together

1613
02:33:42.240 --> 02:33:49.319
paper and about big summer money your phone that has intercepted what

1614
02:33:49.319 --> 02:33:52.880
shop telling about that have you continued to have committed the same type of crime as not as

1615
02:33:52.880 --> 02:33:58.439
For here today it is a coincidence that it is talked about the same things that the person who

1616
02:33:58.439 --> 02:34:01.960
Should step

1617
02:34:01.960 --> 02:34:06.319
How can it be that you involved in that kind of conversation about it now have not

1618
02:34:06.319 --> 02:34:09.120
anything with this that

1619
02:34:17.800 --> 02:34:25.800
do why we changed viewing names on snap just on October 9, 2023 so close after

1620
02:34:25.800 --> 02:34:30.399
the incident why it was not happened before in that case if it was so that someone else

1621
02:34:30.399 --> 02:34:33.200
Person on this

1622
02:34:34.840 --> 02:34:40.640
Account What have you had for contact with Leon Alfson We Snapp in June It wants

1623
02:34:40.640 --> 02:34:45.560
say before the event what have you had contacts then

1624
02:34:50.439 --> 02:34:56.720
If now you are not who is behind the snapp conversations at the time of crime

1625
02:34:56.720 --> 02:35:02.040
which occurs together that occurs with Len Rustic and

1626
02:35:02.040 --> 02:35:07.040
counterpart so I asked the question before will they be on your phone then

1627
02:35:07.040 --> 02:35:11.640
Ask the next question H will parts of them the most incriminating parts that

1628
02:35:11.640 --> 02:35:15.720
they are deleted on your phone that you see that they are found not which

1629
02:35:15.720 --> 02:35:18.720
content

1630
02:35:19.880 --> 02:35:22.760
Then as we certainly from Leon

1631
02:35:27.080 --> 02:35:32.680
led how could you know that it was just in Ã–rebro you would look for a TRT

1632
02:35:32.680 --> 02:35:39.120
Violent acts where Leon Rusti was involved after you talked to Leon Alfsson how

1633
02:35:39.120 --> 02:35:43.720
Did you know what event you would look for it G so many people in Sweden

1634
02:35:43.720 --> 02:35:48.640
for a day it could know that it was, after all, the one who makes an impression on the page

1635
02:35:48.640 --> 02:35:57.240
168 in the analysis that your phone for the morning of 8

1636
02:36:06.600 --> 02:36:13.920
October is that you have instigated this that it is you who lies

1637
02:36:13.920 --> 02:36:20.080
behind chatting there when Leon Alfson is being able to try to look at the song that we

1638
02:36:20.080 --> 02:36:22.520
talking about

1639
02:36:31.439 --> 02:36:36.840
Today we'll see I'll just double check what you said before

1640
02:36:45.000 --> 02:36:51.680
Even if you are now so afraid to be associated with the Fox network as you actually did

1641
02:36:51.680 --> 02:36:56.960
As you said it was then it turns out that you are so careful that you

1642
02:36:56.960 --> 02:37:04.000
sitting with what at least I interpret as a rÃ¤ symbol on your left hand in

1643
02:37:04.000 --> 02:37:08.920
photographs that you yourself say you have shared with

1644
02:37:17.160 --> 02:37:21.160
of mm

1645
02:37:28.080 --> 02:37:34.040
Thanks thank you so much then your defense or we will go for the go on for forgetting here

1646
02:37:34.040 --> 02:37:38.279
Well, no thanks no questions no then you should defend for opportunity here please

1647
02:37:38.279 --> 02:37:42.600
Yes I was going to ask Hansa you reply if you want but prosecution mentioned this one

1648
02:37:42.600 --> 02:37:47.240
the audio file where it is mentioned to step and I can for your knowledge so that it happens

1649
02:37:47.240 --> 02:37:52.279
Two weeks after e rus understand this event, you want to say something about

1650
02:37:52.279 --> 02:37:56.399
It yes, exactly this thing this thing does not have with this goal

1651
02:37:56.399 --> 02:38:00.040
at all to do since I am not talking about something step or

1652
02:38:00.040 --> 02:38:03.279
something that is another person who calls it is he who says and it is about

1653
02:38:03.279 --> 02:38:07.240
Completely different thing he says I can fix a guy so it is not with it that

1654
02:38:07.240 --> 02:38:14.200
do talk about completely different kiss and this with paper and Ã…kl paper would

1655
02:38:14.200 --> 02:38:18.760
Picked up and such stuff that it would be yes so prosecutors try to get it

1656
02:38:18.760 --> 02:38:21.200
here looks like it has to do with this goal of doing it has nothing with it

1657
02:38:21.200 --> 02:38:26.160
Here's the goal of making that conversation it was that it was the day we helped

1658
02:38:26.160 --> 02:38:29.760
a friend and move and I hurt me and I also see in the conversation I

1659
02:38:29.760 --> 02:38:33.319
Only I injured can pick up gloves work gloves in order to thus

1660
02:38:33.319 --> 02:38:36.600
help with the move and I say it took a round we will load on

1661
02:38:36.600 --> 02:38:41.760
stuff and since I ask the guy he lives near this eh what is that apartment

1662
02:38:41.760 --> 02:38:45.800
we would move and where there were no papers or anything so I needed

1663
02:38:45.800 --> 02:38:48.920
Paper So here I have Papers now you understand it has nothing with burned

1664
02:38:48.920 --> 02:38:52.120
to do otherwise if it would be with it wrestles could have said yes picked up

1665
02:38:52.120 --> 02:38:55.520
happens gasoline or something but it is just paper it is nothing that way

1666
02:38:55.520 --> 02:39:02.200
illegal with paper no and rustic and you have been sitting on HVB or have feel

1667
02:39:02.200 --> 02:39:07.920
you any other of those sitting here today no no no no it is not true

1668
02:39:07.920 --> 02:39:11.040
defended or do you know someone else like do you have yes no so I feel

1669
02:39:11.040 --> 02:39:14.120
no one else before, so I do not know SMS owners even why should I do

1670
02:39:14.120 --> 02:39:17.160
something or instigating someone to do something n not I know the people

1671
02:39:17.160 --> 02:39:20.080
Why what do I have against them, even though I knew people I would never

1672
02:39:20.080 --> 02:39:25.600
do sow this crime etc. and I showed during the case here that your

1673
02:39:25.600 --> 02:39:30.479
this snapkit old that it said it was in SkÃ¥ne and then is mine

1674
02:39:30.479 --> 02:39:33.640
Ask you have yes exactly that, yes exactly it is true that it was in

1675
02:39:33.640 --> 02:39:37.760
SkÃ¥ne that too but you can say that the person who was at the account at the time

1676
02:39:37.760 --> 02:39:42.160
he was in SkÃ¥ne such as Alfred who told me that one could see the person

1677
02:39:42.160 --> 02:39:45.640
wherever he was at the police station anything where it was the same thing here man

1678
02:39:45.640 --> 02:39:48.840
can see where exactly the person is the one who uses the account and he is in

1679
02:39:48.840 --> 02:39:51.600
SkÃ¥ne and I have never been one to SkÃ¥ne in my entire life never been in

1680
02:39:51.600 --> 02:39:55.040
Scan never i have no connections to SkÃ¥ne okay then the prosecutor mentions that

1681
02:39:55.040 --> 02:39:59.920
Your phone has been active There are data and connections at the time and for

1682
02:39:59.920 --> 02:40:04.920
event then i wonder a little how do your phone look at netter and so there yes yes so

1683
02:40:04.920 --> 02:40:07.640

1684
02:40:07.640 --> 02:40:11.920
all the time and then also eh it even stands for itself the preliminary investigation to

1685
02:40:11.920 --> 02:40:15.760

1686
02:40:15.760 --> 02:40:18.920

1695
02:40:59.800 --> 02:41:04.800
And then Sandra now for this goes in the same way as for the others here to

1696
02:41:04.800 --> 02:41:09.319
you first get the opportunity to say anything here if you want if it is as

1697
02:41:09.319 --> 02:41:14.319
Prosecutors claim that you have done eh and then the prosecution will have the opportunity to

1698
02:41:14.319 --> 02:41:19.720
Ask questions and goals know the tree and then all the defenders EH will first

1699

1718
02:42:56.640 --> 02:43:01.600
It is the microphones that still eh should test and see if we can move it a bit

1719
02:43:01.600 --> 02:43:05.960
closer to one of the microphones so where yes came picture

1720
02:43:05.960 --> 02:43:12.920
then so yeah so you can talk to more into the microphone so it hears you want to take over

1721
02:43:12.920 --> 02:43:22.720
that you sn all yes you you you said your v called yes and then he asked if I

1722
02:43:22.720 --> 02:43:29.359
could lend my apartment eh because I don't live there but I live with a

1723
02:43:29.359 --> 02:43:34.359
other so it said he would be allowed to borrow mine

1724
02:43:34.359 --> 02:43:40.800
Apartment I got a time I was going to meet him at the station and so took

1725
02:43:40.800 --> 02:43:47.680
we taxi home to me eh and then I showed him around the apartment and then pulled

1726
02:43:47.680 --> 02:43:50.080
I from there

1727
02:43:51.760 --> 02:43:57.680
Was there something else in the apartment then no not what I know I remember I was

1728
02:43:57.680 --> 02:44:02.520
very affected so it may have been where I actually don't know mm was there anybody

1729
02:44:02.520 --> 02:44:08.000
person whom you knew who agreed to his element as Larson has mentioned no

1730
02:44:08.000 --> 02:44:12.520
It is not amigo as angry seat or similar no absolutely not no okay he

1732
02:44:18.359 --> 02:44:24.960
but then so simple you eh who is this friend when it needs

1733
02:44:24.960 --> 02:44:29.520
we don't go into mm and just so we understand then

1734
02:44:29.520 --> 02:44:34.120
each other clearly and clearly you know who it is but don't want to tell you this

1735
02:44:34.120 --> 02:44:42.760
mm okay eh know Daniel this friend yes m it makes h okay you can just tell

1736
02:44:42.760 --> 02:44:46.680
A little grom with you and Daniel so the relationship gets ready for us so say that

1737
02:44:46.680 --> 02:44:50.720
you have been married like that but can we tell yourself yes what should I say we were married

1738
02:44:50.720 --> 02:44:56.439
and then he started taking heroin and then I left him etc. and when in time we are

1739
02:44:56.439 --> 02:44:59.520
then about it was probably a month before

1740
02:44:59.520 --> 02:45:05.640
This happens, etc. he has been shown something in your apartment after that

1741
02:45:05.640 --> 02:45:11.160
No you are sure of no I am not but not when i have been there in all

1742
02:45:11.160 --> 02:45:18.399
Case when you've been there no okay What is what are you knowing

1743
02:45:18.399 --> 02:45:24.399
about the friend and why should you do this no it was nothing special at all

1744
02:45:24.399 --> 02:45:29.720
would come h so get a friend he just said mm there was nothing strange at all

1745
02:45:29.720 --> 02:45:36.080
mm he has set up and let me be allowed to live with him then but feel acquaintance to

1746
02:45:36.080 --> 02:45:42.200
him and so there so there was no weirdness no f they speak none

1747
02:45:42.200 --> 02:45:46.200
weirdness where I claim that you are interrogation early and told it it was

1748
02:45:46.200 --> 02:45:53.840
A friend of you who would come no friend yeah yeah okay okay and that i said

1749
02:45:53.840 --> 02:46:00.520
from the beginning too okay just right

1750
02:46:01.080 --> 02:46:05.840
What I thought we might be able to take it right away so it gets clarified

1751
02:46:05.840 --> 02:46:15.080
Page 569 Here mentioned a task eh it g that summary in itself

1752
02:46:15.399 --> 02:46:20.920
But in the middle here, the question if you remembered you would meet someone it

1753
02:46:20.920 --> 02:46:24.960
day and then we talk on October 7 when m eh then the answer is the police have

1754
02:46:24.960 --> 02:46:30.800
Signed here now yes but you know that I have done me what should I say

1755
02:46:30.800 --> 02:46:35.760
So I lend the apartment to a friend friend for it to come on

1756
02:46:35.760 --> 02:46:41.040
Visit I didn't know it again anything I don't have to do with that then have

1757
02:46:41.040 --> 02:46:47.800
the police wrote wrong there then it will so my friend's friend yeah okay exactly what I was

1758
02:46:47.800 --> 02:46:52.399
after all, from the start but that you are not my friend etc. without it being a

1759
02:46:52.399 --> 02:46:57.920
friend of him and when you meet up Leon then

1760
02:46:57.920 --> 02:47:04.200
what like what have you been told about that meeting then nothing I got a

1761
02:47:04.200 --> 02:47:11.240
Time I would be at the eh station so I went there and stood there then and

1762
02:47:11.240 --> 02:47:16.240
Then he came up to me He recognized me well I think

1763
02:47:16.240 --> 02:47:20.840
mm just that mm

1764
02:47:20.880 --> 02:47:28.720
And yes what do what do you do then eh we take a taxi to me

1765
02:47:28.720 --> 02:47:33.880
mm do you buy something yes i buy a lighter he asked if i had lighter

1766
02:47:33.880 --> 02:47:37.359
so i went in and bought a teeth and so mm and so i was inside and bought a

1767
02:47:37.359 --> 02:47:41.399
Candy bag for myself before just that so first you buy a candy bag for you

1768
02:47:41.399 --> 02:47:45.640
yourself and then so when get there so you buy a lit for him

1769
02:47:45.640 --> 02:47:51.200
Yeah how will s you buy a lit for him when he asked for a lighter yes

1770
02:47:51.200 --> 02:47:55.439
Then I said I can go in and buy one for you and why was it so to MÃ¶ SkÃ¥

1771
02:47:55.439 --> 02:48:00.240
then but then it is no wonder why would I not be

1772
02:48:00.240 --> 02:48:06.479
my friends' friends are my friends yes okay yes you had no liters of own

1773
02:48:06.479 --> 02:48:12.200
from the beginning no okay no one i wanted to give anyway no

1774
02:48:12.200 --> 02:48:17.120
Okay I understand then we have looked at pictures and movies and stuff like that

1775
02:48:17.120 --> 02:48:20.960
until when you receive this lights up the money too and pick up

1776
02:48:20.960 --> 02:48:24.680
Something on the floor can you tell us a little about your own words like what is happening no

1777
02:48:24.680 --> 02:48:28.560
It is nothing strange so I have been convicted before because they have found

1778
02:48:28.560 --> 02:48:34.240
my DNA stuff on site my lawyer here showed when he did

1779
02:48:34.240 --> 02:48:39.359
case request so I may not really want to leave me a lighter for

1780
02:48:39.359 --> 02:48:47.200
I don't know if he is going out on less crime eh type go out and break storage on

1781
02:48:47.200 --> 02:48:51.880
evenings or so there are many of my friends who do it etc. Don't you trust

1782
02:48:51.880 --> 02:48:56.920
The no, but it is not that difficult, so you can lose a lighter when

1783
02:48:56.920 --> 02:49:01.680
You are out of it is no wonder they have even find

1784
02:49:01.680 --> 02:49:08.080
Computers and stuff that belongs to Ã–rebro Municipality in my cars so that so friend's

1785
02:49:08.080 --> 02:49:10.960
friends it is not going like all the way it is not that you trust them for

1786
02:49:10.960 --> 02:49:16.840
A thing so -called I trust him he would never put anything on the spot

1787
02:49:16.840 --> 02:49:21.920
intention but it is easy to lose if you are out and make stuff small

1788
02:49:21.920 --> 02:49:26.479
criminal things deeds but means that you understood that this is

1789
02:49:26.479 --> 02:49:29.399
about crime that was what one did no it was not so i said now

1790
02:49:29.399 --> 02:49:34.319
Do you distort my sentences yes no I just ask but it wore it

1791
02:49:34.319 --> 02:49:39.319
appreciated I don't know what other people do on their

1792
02:49:39.319 --> 02:49:46.080
leisure this with that you were afraid to leave DNA on the lighter it is after all

1793
02:49:46.080 --> 02:49:51.200
something that I claim has not come up with anything for police with has done it

1794
02:49:51.200 --> 02:49:56.760
was the first thing i said j jaar i history because i don't want to

1795
02:49:56.760 --> 02:50:01.760
My friend is going to get involved in this and it is for my own safety now I

1796
02:50:01.760 --> 02:50:06.120
not with fix take me now prime.se

1797
02:50:07.640 --> 02:50:10.640
Ok

1798
02:50:12.399 --> 02:50:17.120
Mm precisely that because there is information about

1799
02:50:17.120 --> 02:50:19.960
For example

1800
02:50:20.760 --> 02:50:23.840
Looking at the page

1801
02:50:24.640 --> 02:50:30.760
588 so you have there is some other explanation for this tend

1802
02:50:30.760 --> 02:50:33.800
first stick yes as I just said just right

1803
02:50:33.800 --> 02:50:38.960
just so I didn't want my friend to get involved in this for my

1804
02:50:38.960 --> 02:50:42.760
own safety so I came up with one

1805
02:50:42.760 --> 02:50:49.279
Other version etc. But now we are so far so now I feel that it better to

1806
02:50:49.279 --> 02:50:54.520
I am honest yes just that but if we say this then then need

1807
02:50:54.520 --> 02:50:57.920
We don't read anything is true that it was before the sign on among the

1808
02:50:57.920 --> 02:51:01.640
Other risk of Corona Eh

1809
02:51:01.640 --> 02:51:08.279
compulsive thoughts yes, although it is true to a certain extent also do it but that is true

1810
02:51:08.279 --> 02:51:15.430
that I have said that etc. Okay I understand ehm

1811
02:51:15.430 --> 02:51:18.540
[Music]

1812
02:51:19.960 --> 02:51:24.439
But to leave Leon in this case alone in the apartment as well as how did you think

1813
02:51:24.439 --> 02:51:31.359
around it then yes it is my friend's responsibility that his friends take care of themselves in my

1814
02:51:31.359 --> 02:51:36.920
Housing yes just as I did in his friends

1815
02:51:36.920 --> 02:51:41.800
Housing but you talk about people putting the municipality's computers in your car

1816
02:51:41.800 --> 02:51:46.040
and other things that you dare not leave DNA on lit and yet like you sound

1817
02:51:46.040 --> 02:51:50.880
him stay there and alone as you say trusts well that she does not reason yes

1818
02:51:50.880 --> 02:51:58.120
How can you trust him then I don't know v I will explain to

1819
02:51:58.120 --> 02:52:03.239
the sake of clarity I do not know what to form so that you understand me right in

1820
02:52:03.239 --> 02:52:10.439
This I don't know who he is no I don't know what he's doing I know that around

1821
02:52:10.439 --> 02:52:15.840
my friends and me so there are very criminal acts that are not done

1822
02:52:15.840 --> 02:52:21.920
murder and none of them without people out and break at nights in advance and stuff etc.

1823
02:52:21.920 --> 02:52:27.040
and that I leave from a lighter to someone I don't know if he is holding on

1824
02:52:27.040 --> 02:52:32.479
with that and he drops the one I know there are many others who have

1825
02:52:32.479 --> 02:52:36.800
lost several times when they have been out they have been allowed to go back to the scene

1826
02:52:36.800 --> 02:52:42.080
and pick up their stuff but that doesn't mean i think

1827
02:52:42.080 --> 02:52:47.880
that he is going to do something like that and I trust he doesn't cut away from me etc.

1828
02:52:47.880 --> 02:52:51.960
I t, for example, that I could leave the theft in your apartment without

1829
02:52:51.960 --> 02:52:56.479
been out and broken and only contact to Ã–rebro is just your apartment so that

1830
02:52:56.479 --> 02:53:01.880
haven't I even thought of no okay no but then so it understands

1831
02:53:01.880 --> 02:53:08.479
ehm in the taxi then you can tell us a little about the trip then who is paying and and and

1832
02:53:08.479 --> 02:53:13.840
so on it is me who pay I got a smaller s of money etc. but I

1833
02:53:13.840 --> 02:53:20.359
Where did my friend meet and then it was said that I would pay the taxi with them and

1834
02:53:20.359 --> 02:53:27.760
then he would get the rest of the money that was over mm okay eh so we went and took

1835
02:53:27.760 --> 02:53:32.600
a taxi only i paid then i gave him the money okay how much money got

1836
02:53:32.600 --> 02:53:39.080
he i don't know exactly a 1000 patch 1500 it was food for a few days mm we stepped

1837
02:53:39.080 --> 02:53:43.560
off in by the ground too for me to show him where closest wants to beat yes yes

1838
02:53:43.560 --> 02:53:49.399
yeah just that for you i never have food home with me no no okay

1839
02:53:49.399 --> 02:53:51.560
just

1840
02:53:52.040 --> 02:53:58.279
it would you get something yourself for this you have a friend no it was my friend

1841
02:53:58.279 --> 02:54:03.840
He needed a favor etc he needed help and he is very lonely so I

1842
02:54:03.840 --> 02:54:07.720
thought it was fun for H that he would get friends who came to say okay

1843
02:54:07.720 --> 02:54:12.520
And when when was it you got this money and the mission itself then eh yes

1844
02:54:12.520 --> 02:54:18.439
It was probably an hour before I was m it an hour before yes okay so before

1845
02:54:18.439 --> 02:54:23.600
it knows absolutely nothing then but no okay

1846
02:54:23.600 --> 02:54:29.120
Mm have you seen any gasoline can or bottle similar to those we have seen in here in

1847
02:54:29.120 --> 02:54:37.160
the apartment something nothing such no you when it comes to this money then gets

1848
02:54:37.160 --> 02:54:41.000
you correct if i'm wrong but you have i say you have left completely different

1849
02:54:41.000 --> 02:54:45.920
information about where this money comes from eye eh I said well that I was

1850
02:54:45.920 --> 02:54:50.880
my so -called money first then yes but just yes no it is not true as I said

1851
02:54:50.880 --> 02:54:58.319
keep my friend outside here mm mm okay but then so and Sandra told in

1852
02:54:58.319 --> 02:55:02.479
later interrogation that the points come from the friend or how yes yes but I

1853
02:55:02.479 --> 02:55:06.160
still want to double check the ones that exist

1854
02:55:07.359 --> 02:55:14.120
Here's exactly that and what about this bike as it is not my bike I

1855
02:55:14.120 --> 02:55:17.760
thought it was there first because i had a black bike but it was full black

1856
02:55:17.760 --> 02:55:22.880
my cy bike etc so I know nothing about that bike okay and what was it like

1857
02:55:22.880 --> 02:55:27.399
In fact, it fck it to come to the conclusion that it was no longer a bike then

1858
02:55:27.399 --> 02:55:32.399
mine was completely black mm I see the pictures it is marks on that bike

1859
02:55:32.399 --> 02:55:37.840
Who has where I have read pel yes yes in it there are pictures of the bike etc. and

1860
02:55:37.840 --> 02:55:44.160
it has marks on it it had not mine was whole black okay so that bike that

1861
02:55:44.160 --> 02:55:48.800
had got rid of when it has disappeared in some other way then yes etc.

1862
02:55:48.800 --> 02:55:54.279
the same day from your apartment no it wasn't what I said no I wasn't

1863
02:55:54.279 --> 02:56:01.479
back to my apartment before the days just before I was arrested yes okay but

1864
02:56:01.479 --> 02:56:06.399
that the bike has made it from an apartment as yes I even think it

1865
02:56:06.399 --> 02:56:12.800
is in the pupa being that my I had a friend lived with me where I suspect that

1866
02:56:12.800 --> 02:56:17.239
it is he who has taken the bike from there when the police threw him out let my

1867
02:56:17.239 --> 02:56:25.080
apartment etc. Without approval on my side okay and who was this then we

1868
02:56:25.080 --> 02:56:31.920
don't have to go into name no no there is m up there too

1869
02:56:32.120 --> 02:56:35.439
Mm just

1870
02:56:35.840 --> 02:56:39.560
It mm late

1871
02:56:39.560 --> 02:56:47.359
eh we were inside a little neighbor at Daniel there so where he had he had stuck you said

1872
02:56:47.359 --> 02:56:51.359
have you like have you and Daniel been in contact something in conjunction with

1873
02:56:51.359 --> 02:56:57.200
this event no because we have a purely now one

1874
02:56:57.200 --> 02:57:01.920
connection between you and Daniel as his DNA is on that cans and on a couple

1875
02:57:01.920 --> 02:57:08.000
Gloves when smile clutch do you mean yes the clutch is

1876
02:57:08.000 --> 02:57:13.960
it is that when Leon is arrested, there is there on or at his person's objects that

1877
02:57:13.960 --> 02:57:20.160
has daniels it doesn't have to mean that me and Daniel have had contact no so

1878
02:57:21.319 --> 02:57:27.319
For sorry it's just indications everything it just indications yes

1879
02:57:27.319 --> 02:57:31.840
okay [music]

1880
02:57:31.840 --> 02:57:37.279
Mm but i think like this now you have any control over if Daniel was something in your

1881
02:57:37.279 --> 02:57:41.200
apartment if when you were not there no I have not

1882
02:57:41.200 --> 02:57:47.080
No i had no key i can't lock you have asked your friend anything about

1883
02:57:47.080 --> 02:57:52.000
This then how it is related to no I have not why do you not have it why

1884
02:57:52.000 --> 02:57:56.080
would I therefore be suspected of crime which you know after

1885
02:57:56.080 --> 02:58:01.920
Like the police fuk on yes but I have already heard everything from my friend

1886
02:58:01.920 --> 02:58:06.359
and what did you hear from your friend then we need we don't have to go into it we

1887
02:58:06.359 --> 02:58:11.239
can leave my friend outside it mm Although you do not talk about him anymore without

1888
02:58:11.239 --> 02:58:14.080
just about the information that you have provided to you that is, what you have known to

1889
02:58:14.080 --> 02:58:19.760
and once you know that no comment

1890
02:58:19.760 --> 02:58:23.359
Okay then

1891
02:58:27.520 --> 02:58:32.960
So these gloves that Leer is wearing when he arrests recognize they are for your

1892
02:58:32.960 --> 02:58:36.120
Apartment No.

1893
02:58:36.840 --> 02:58:43.080
No just like that then we have some searches too

1894
02:58:43.080 --> 02:58:48.239
on this event on your phone thus quite late after the incident is

1895
02:58:48.239 --> 02:58:53.200
It no wonder what is it strange about it yes but tell me what should

1896
02:58:53.200 --> 02:58:58.720
I tell me why were you why not that is what is it I would

1897
02:58:58.720 --> 02:59:03.880
prove h saying this is what you are suspected of crime I claim that you have done

1898
02:59:03.880 --> 02:59:07.520
one more divorced to Medh for preparation for murder yes I know I have taken it

1899
02:59:07.520 --> 02:59:12.200
And of course I wonder why you have sought information for this

1900
02:59:12.200 --> 02:59:15.560
the incident that you are suspected of that makes you sit here today yes I know

1901
02:59:15.560 --> 02:59:20.920
not you know don't believe yourself no you may not set you may not

1902
02:59:20.920 --> 02:59:25.399
ask questions back and the prosecutor is trying to formulate questions and then so

1903
02:59:25.399 --> 02:59:29.239
Do you choose whether or not to answer so that prosecutors try to formulate questions

1904
02:59:29.239 --> 02:59:33.439
And and Sandra Petterson does not ask questions back on the prosecution why

1905
02:59:33.439 --> 02:59:38.160
Have you searched for information about the one I knew I was withdrawn in that

1906
02:59:38.160 --> 02:59:44.200
m and I knew my ex -man was detained for that so it is clear about

1907
02:59:44.200 --> 02:59:48.600
one is interested and wonders what it is

1908
02:59:48.600 --> 02:59:52.399
where it says it will cod soon it means

1909
02:59:52.399 --> 02:59:56.200
Nothing means nothing no it means nothing i sit here five

1910
02:59:56.200 --> 03:00:01.520
months later or how but it doesn't say i'm prime.se have you

1911
03:00:01.520 --> 03:00:05.640
cod now yes apparently I have r because i sit here after five

1912
03:00:05.640 --> 03:00:12.160
months okay okay then so cod it doesn't mean that

1913
03:00:12.160 --> 03:00:19.880
one is guilty in any way one can cod innocent as well

1914
03:00:19.880 --> 03:00:26.520
Okay but if you get suspected of crime you have coded then or are to be judged

1915
03:00:26.520 --> 03:00:31.439
first but you cod you do when you get locked up if you become

1916
03:00:31.439 --> 03:00:39.399
arrested in i i i a lob it does not mean that you owe no man can

1917
03:00:39.399 --> 03:00:46.920
cod as innocent mm during the time as you before you were arrested after the event

1918
03:00:46.920 --> 03:00:50.000
So do you have after I think change phone numbers then so you have swap

1919
03:00:50.000 --> 03:00:55.200
Phone Numba wand once va according to can see not even twice yes why

1920
03:00:55.200 --> 03:00:59.880
have you done it as it is not something strange I change the phone to

1921
03:00:59.880 --> 03:01:03.760
phone numbers as often i change lingerie so it always has been for

1922
03:01:03.760 --> 03:01:08.439
me why is it so because they get stolen they disappear i drop them

1923
03:01:08.439 --> 03:01:14.840
The kids have Sunder them etc. Okay I understand but just that it happens

1924
03:01:14.840 --> 03:01:18.279
so closely related to this event with something somewhat active choice only one

1925
03:01:18.279 --> 03:01:25.279
pure coincidence yes just a pure coincidence and I wish and this so with the phase in hand

1926
03:01:25.279 --> 03:01:31.200
so had I wanted to have the phone left etc that I had then and why had

1927
03:01:31.200 --> 03:01:36.640
you wanted it then because I had a prove even more of my virginity in this

1928
03:01:36.640 --> 03:01:42.399
Okay what had we found then nothing okay that is exactly what is the thing ie

1929
03:01:42.399 --> 03:01:48.640
found as little as this time okay mm

1930
03:01:48.640 --> 03:01:52.600
and why do you stay away from the police where because i put to do be ill

1931
03:01:52.600 --> 03:01:57.040
I didn't stay away I was sick but you sat if saying so here is

1932
03:01:57.040 --> 03:02:00.319

03:05:32.080 --> 03:05:39.080
your interrogations and so we start it when you touched something when you were arrested yes eh can

1974
03:05:39.080 --> 03:05:42.840
you tell us anything about your condition your health condition and how

1975
03:05:42.840 --> 03:05:49.040
had been the time before the police eh it wasn't good I was bedridden in two

1976
03:05:49.040 --> 03:05:54.720
months m simply i had kidneybÃ¤ck infection and so i had an infection in

1977
03:05:54.720 --> 03:05:59.920
the spine while the doctor missed etc so I was in to urgently when I went

1978
03:05:59.920 --> 03:06:03.920
Ambulance in the first time etc. I understand on what you told you have followed

1979
03:06:03.920 --> 03:06:10.040
reporting about this mm eh when and how did you realize that your ex -man Daniel

1980
03:06:10.040 --> 03:06:18.439
where was deprived of liberty pretty fast yes my friend called me yes pretty fast yes

1981
03:06:18.439 --> 03:06:22.120
is it only then that you get to know about it when he is already

1982
03:06:22.120 --> 03:06:25.239
Liberty now I did not understand it was then in Samand with the fact that he was

1983
03:06:25.239 --> 03:06:28.200
detainee as you understood it was

1984
03:06:28.200 --> 03:06:34.920
Just then eh you tell you that it will be until early December

1985
03:06:34.920 --> 03:06:41.040
Eh what have you known and what have you had an idea of the police's interest in

1986
03:06:41.040 --> 03:06:44.600
For you as we know, after all, in this investigation is there, so I have understood

1987
03:06:44.600 --> 03:06:51.160
that they have wanted to have me eh on interrogation yes eh but I didn't think it was

1988
03:06:51.160 --> 03:06:55.760
that I was as seriously involved as I am because one time for it

1989
03:06:55.760 --> 03:07:01.399
Booked interrogation before I was sick so it was quite long between the dates

1990
03:07:01.399 --> 03:07:07.359
from when at the hearing would be sky so you have known and you have been called

1991
03:07:07.359 --> 03:07:14.760
to to police interrogation yes through contact with the police yes yoke you and you mentioned so

1992
03:07:14.760 --> 03:07:21.319

1993
03:07:23.479 --> 03:07:28.239
ehm you tell you about your illness and we can too

1994
03:07:28.239 --> 03:07:32.279
eh backwards you have told you and it appears that you have a

1995
03:07:32.279 --> 03:07:38.040
abuse problems bit made clear that it did not include heroin but during

1996
03:07:38.040 --> 03:07:43.319
this period around the crime and until you seize how was it with

1997
03:07:43.319 --> 03:07:48.080

2026
03:10:33.279 --> 03:10:37.920
If the apartment as he has told this

2027
03:10:37.920 --> 03:10:40.720
The apartment can tell you about circumstance to it how long do you have

2028
03:10:40.720 --> 03:10:49.680

2029
03:10:49.680 --> 03:10:56.399
Yeah with me earlier before i took over it yes but he pulled there reach someone

2030
03:10:56.399 --> 03:11:00.880
time in early September so he was not at home when I got home one day

2031
03:11:00.880 --> 03:11:06.760
eh you touched it but in terms of access to the apartment eh how has

2032
03:11:06.760 --> 03:11:11.840
It has been with it to be able to access the apartment how there are many who

2033
03:11:11.840 --> 03:11:17.800
have lived there in and out mm and then I had not much let take mm

2034
03:11:17.800 --> 03:11:23.000
and that you did not have key v what the means has the apartment been unlocked

2035
03:11:23.000 --> 03:11:29.279
Yes but then you know so Daniel has moved out of the apartment

2036
03:11:29.279 --> 03:11:32.279
Yes

2037
03:11:33.560 --> 03:11:40.560
ehm you get omb then to lend that apartment and then you pray to

2038
03:11:40.560 --> 03:11:44.840
The station and so you got questions and were confronted with information in I

2039
03:11:44.840 --> 03:11:49.840
the preliminary investigation into what you said said about that you remember what you said in

2040
03:11:49.840 --> 03:11:56.359
Your first interrogation question again did not understand you received

2041
03:11:56.359 --> 03:12:00.680
questions about why you have handled the tÃ¤nan on it

2042
03:12:00.680 --> 03:12:07.640
ways that you do remember what you told you then yes that I am careful etc.

2043
03:12:07.640 --> 03:12:12.319
eh considering that the prosecutor read up and who has said later for I would

2044
03:12:12.319 --> 03:12:16.600
want to reproduce then if you don't remember exactly why picks up the tÃ¤n so for

2045
03:12:16.600 --> 03:12:20.279
I am careful if I don't know people how do you mean I don't know what

2046
03:12:20.279 --> 03:12:23.720
my stuff ends up i'm just careful of myself because i live that life that

2047
03:12:23.720 --> 03:12:27.319
I do I don't know what lit harbor since I don't know the man I know

2048
03:12:27.319 --> 03:12:31.200

2049
03:12:31.200 --> 03:12:36.399
have said so in the first hearing we'll see which side was it yes sorry I

2050
03:12:36.399 --> 03:12:42.520
did not reproduce it but this is on page 553 and it is apart from eh it

2051
03:12:42.520 --> 03:12:46.239
initial short interrogation the first longer hearing held with Sandra

2052
03:12:46.239 --> 03:12:50.359
Pettersson wherever is there somewhere about the page is almost at the bottom

2053
03:12:50.359 --> 03:12:55.560
Page 554 This is the third question from the bottom why do you pick up the lighter so it

2054
03:12:55.560 --> 03:12:58.960
subsequent question how does mean

2055
03:13:00.800 --> 03:13:06.840

2057
03:13:20.880 --> 03:13:29.120
ehm about the money you eh describes food money etc. We see that the lighter is paid

2058
03:13:29.120 --> 03:13:36.640
with a 500 lamp yes eh as you remed it is the 500 patch of own money or is

that money no it is money i would give reach money yes ehm we will

2060
03:13:43.680 --> 03:13:49.080
Certainly hear a taxi driver later and I have seen information that the taxi ride should

2061
03:13:49.080 --> 03:13:55.080
have cost SEK 250 you have any idea of taxi ride cost yes

2062

2063
03:14:01.120 --> 03:14:05.600
you remember with cash yes and and be your own cash or cash no

2064
03:14:05.600 --> 03:14:10.880
it was as I would give it was the friend's intention that you got these

2065
03:14:10.880 --> 03:14:17.319
Money also so as not to pay the taxi yes and do you have any idea then

1500 or something mm approximately mm

2069
03:14:50.960 --> 03:14:58.600
you have now and already during your time marry so you have seen other pages of what it

2070
03:14:58.600 --> 03:15:01.560
has been there for background or what the prosecutor is on there for a background

2071
03:15:01.560 --> 03:15:09.479
Yes did you have any knowledge of the criminal plans of others or whatever

2072
03:15:09.479 --> 03:15:15.880
no one asks the hypothetical question if you had been aware of the person you

2073
03:15:15.880 --> 03:15:20.680

03:17:37.040 --> 03:17:41.640
heroin it was in September you said yes and I understood it as it was a bit

2098
03:17:41.640 --> 03:17:48.359
of a red line for you yes yes it is your view that Daniel is so deep in

2099
03:17:48.359 --> 03:17:52.640
the abuse that he starts with heroin then it is pretty bad yes it is not

2100
03:17:52.640 --> 03:17:56.640
would you say it is his main feature in normal cases yes in ordinary cases but

2101
03:17:56.640 --> 03:18:01.279
Not when we do with the item no so this was really a decline in

2102
03:18:01.279 --> 03:18:06.640
The abuse can be said so yes eh then the prosecutor has asked a lot of questions about it

2103
03:18:06.640 --> 03:18:11.399
Here the friend who both lending out your apartment yes but eh is not that you

03:18:15.199 --> 03:18:20.080
Daniel got involved without the only pure conclusions from my s yes speculation

2106
03:18:20.080 --> 03:18:25.080

Ask as you defense asked what was a little unclear answer it is about

2110
03:18:37.680 --> 03:18:43.000
that Daniel would have been in an apartment and been thrown out of neighbor M when time

2111
03:18:43.000 --> 03:18:48.840
would it have been roughly i don't know i my don't be what i know it was

The recording so we have input and then there is a hearing with Daniel

2119
03:19:27.080 --> 03:19:32.680
Pettersson here when Daniel then comes to the same way as for the others here

2120
03:19:32.680 --> 03:19:35.720
that you first have the opportunity to say something yourself first if you want

2121
03:19:35.720 --> 03:19:39.000
don't need it but you get that opportunity first and then you will

2122
03:19:39.000 --> 03:19:43.520
get questions from the prosecutor and perhaps from the target tree and eh then will

2123
03:19:43.520 --> 03:19:47.279
the defenders have the opportunity also your defender will have the opportunity first yes

2124
03:19:47.279 --> 03:19:52.000
But do you want to say something yourself first about what is said here yes

2125
03:19:52.000 --> 03:19:58.760
So what should I start

2126
03:19:58.760 --> 03:20:04.840
Eh i can start by wake up on a toilet prime crime

2127
03:20:04.840 --> 03:20:14.279
DSE Because I was I am, as I said, homeless and wake up reach toilet was

2129
03:20:19.520 --> 03:20:28.040

[Music] so

2132
03:20:38.319 --> 03:20:45.160
Yeah so I just should take the day of the day as well as do what you usually do when you

2133
03:20:45.160 --> 03:20:50.080
is because, as I said I am n i am an addict

2134
03:20:50.080 --> 03:20:55.359

2135

2181
03:25:36.680 --> 03:25:43.040
The Macken Okay so that's why you go to the other maen on Ã–stermalm's plan

2182
03:25:43.040 --> 03:25:48.560
or Ã–sterplan is called S's yes mm just okay so that is why you go

2183
03:25:48.560 --> 03:25:53.520
cyclary there then so it is why you cycle right there then to yes that

2184
03:25:53.520 --> 03:25:58.439
So was it just cycled there that

2185
03:25:58.439 --> 03:26:04.960
was like my body just went so there so drove by itself etc. yes but

2186
03:26:04.960 --> 03:26:09.199
It is not that you chose the needle in another place so as not to wake up

2187
03:26:09.199 --> 03:26:17.080
much attention up no, for no no what did you have that can with

2188
03:26:17.080 --> 03:26:23.800
gasoline and so when it was on the east floor then was that can with gasoline as you

2189
03:26:23.800 --> 03:26:29.960
You bought at SÃ¶dermalm's bag I have a bag on one bag is my home

2190
03:26:29.960 --> 03:26:34.439
Like then it is clothes and stuff so you have bags and stuff after all

2191
03:26:34.439 --> 03:26:39.279
when cycling around yes and is home yes so they are in the bag okay

2192
03:26:39.279 --> 03:26:45.800
Mm just that mm and how long did you take all this as i had no mobile

2193
03:26:45.800 --> 03:26:52.239
or clock so i don't know no yes when you bought on the east floor then what do you

2194
03:26:52.239 --> 03:26:56.840
then then v in other place yes just yes

2195
03:26:56.840 --> 03:27:01.520
cycled back up to Olof Palme where we met so we just shifted yes late

2196
03:27:01.520 --> 03:27:05.520
Went we ate whose hobb was he left there when you or was he there in place when

2197
03:27:05.520 --> 03:27:11.520
you got there or yes he was already there yes okay got it approved then what you bought

2198
03:27:11.520 --> 03:27:16.760
Was that where you would do yes I got the drugs so yes

2199
03:27:16.760 --> 03:27:20.560
Because it feels a bit neighbor as a coincidence how much ethanol you shop as looking

2200
03:27:20.560 --> 03:27:24.800
up bottle as i understand it va or have understood it wrong that you are forced to look

2201
03:27:24.800 --> 03:27:30.279
up mortgage bottles or bottle to the speech we must have something to pour out

2202
03:27:30.279 --> 03:27:39.399
Like yes it was then then I usually root for pledged money yes but was it

2203
03:27:39.399 --> 03:27:43.640
Just one and a half liters of zero you would buy it I don't really remember

2204
03:27:43.640 --> 03:27:51.479
It was just there so okay okay as I said I'm in

2205
03:27:51.479 --> 03:27:56.760
severe abuse during this period so it is very foggy mm it is

2206
03:27:56.760 --> 03:28:00.359
Almost so that I don't feel good either, it's almost like that I don't

2207
03:28:00.359 --> 03:28:08.160
want to live mm mm and when you get when you hand over then d gasoline and

2208
03:28:08.160 --> 03:28:13.239
The ethanol is it when you get yes we simply change then I jump on the bike and

2209
03:28:13.239 --> 03:28:17.520
just pulls to the nearest public toilet mm

2210
03:28:17.520 --> 03:28:24.880
m and how much money represents this drug approximately f yes what can

2211
03:28:24.880 --> 03:28:29.439
it be what was it 2 g about what could it be

2212
03:28:29.439 --> 03:28:38.239
400 400 approximately mm mm and this by getting SEK 400 approximately

2213
03:28:38.239 --> 03:28:44.479
is paid for shopping some gasoline and a little ethanol it feels like pretty good

2214
03:28:44.479 --> 03:28:49.399
Paid had ner no thing to put and the purpose of that

2215
03:28:49.399 --> 03:28:56.359
Well to get as much paid as 400 kral you got t gr the yes I got

2216
03:28:56.359 --> 03:29:01.720
no money no okay no but i'm a bit of a blow i use pay so you

2217
03:29:01.720 --> 03:29:07.160
Got drugs yes I call as payment yes yes but ok we say this

2218
03:29:07.160 --> 03:29:13.439
instead then to get such a large exchange for this service as drug value

2219
03:29:13.439 --> 03:29:20.160
about SEK 400 m refuel around it as well as it was felt strange or that

2220
03:29:20.160 --> 03:29:27.239
So it was no thought that I can feel good for a couple of hours

2221
03:29:27.239 --> 03:29:32.199
as well as you asked this person what the gasoline would be used for no that

2222
03:29:32.199 --> 03:29:37.000
Here so this was a completely random person as well as

2223
03:29:37.000 --> 03:29:44.239
I I don't know I didn't stand and shit chat with him so I just wanted to go fast

2224
03:29:44.239 --> 03:29:48.479
Okay but if if I have understood it right now all that you said and that is so

2225
03:29:48.479 --> 03:29:51.439
you said forewear too but if i have understood it right now then you might

2226
03:29:51.439 --> 03:29:55.399
not so much about what Nen is to be used for but it is important that you get it

2227
03:29:55.399 --> 03:30:01.239
drug no but then i don't know

2228
03:30:01.239 --> 03:30:08.560
what no no yes you did not ask what yes you did not ask h said you were no so

2229
03:30:08.560 --> 03:30:14.680
I was so in I had only one thing yes okay no but then we release you we have

2230
03:30:14.680 --> 03:30:22.239
found yours also has on a pair of gloves that Le Rus is wearing etc. you have

2231
03:30:22.239 --> 03:30:28.040
any knowledge of coming i know nothing about some gloves

2232
03:30:28.040 --> 03:30:32.560
No is it true that Sandra says that you have been in her position not become

2233
03:30:32.560 --> 03:30:37.760
Explained by one's neighbor Wanted is his name I think but I have not been where I

2234
03:30:37.760 --> 03:30:43.239
have been to Palme Torg and then I have gone and drugged since reach no I have

2235
03:30:43.239 --> 03:30:47.439
not been there no i have not had to reach contact with her at all

2236
03:30:47.439 --> 03:30:52.479
And you haven't been that kind of the day before or reach that either then no no no

2237
03:30:52.479 --> 03:30:57.720
Do you have any explanation how it turns out that gasoline ends up with Leon

2238
03:30:57.720 --> 03:31:04.720
and that gloves with your DNA end up with Leon No No No idea because I think

2239
03:31:04.720 --> 03:31:08.880
so then that since you have been married to Sandra so I think you have

2240
03:31:08.880 --> 03:31:11.880
somehow have contact with her

2241
03:31:11.880 --> 03:31:16.439
and I think like this that you somehow contact with Sandra

2242
03:31:16.439 --> 03:31:21.920
and make sure that gasoline and gloves come to Leon but that is not true then

2243
03:31:21.920 --> 03:31:27.600
So no no okay you recognize these

2244
03:31:27.600 --> 03:31:33.239
Gloves No I have never seen them before no

2245
03:31:33.239 --> 03:31:37.720

03:31:56.680 --> 03:32:02.600

Yes the apartment and laundry room etc. then I see a guy who goes

2301
03:36:21.439 --> 03:36:27.880
outside the gate back and forth and eh he writes on the phone

2302
03:36:27.880 --> 03:36:34.000

2306
03:36:52.560 --> 03:36:57.040
But I went there were many times I saw anyway as I went ahead and

2307
03:36:57.040 --> 03:37:02.680
back many times mm so start to look a bit strange just that

2308
03:37:02.680 --> 03:37:11.359
it by viik etc. yes what what happened what happened since then eh shall we

2309
03:37:11.359 --> 03:37:17.960
See yes it was well when I was done with the laundry and by at ten o'clock

2310
03:37:17.960 --> 03:37:24.560
So then he wants to follow M into the gate yes and then it was locked so stood behind

2311
03:37:24.560 --> 03:37:29.520
me and then I looked at the look at him and

2312
03:37:29.520 --> 03:37:35.760
Then he said he would want to enter his grandmother or grandmother etc. and then released

2313
03:37:35.760 --> 03:37:43.560
i just in but it didn't feel so good then so yes i went leave the laundry and

2314

So I went out again and the wig was around the block mm and then

2315
03:37:48.040 --> 03:37:54.080
went back in and hold in the stairwell and then then put cigarette butts in the lock

2316
03:37:54.080 --> 03:38:01.479
on the door etc. and so it could not be locked ok so it stood down then yes exactly

2317
03:38:01.479 --> 03:38:05.720
Mm and then I went and then checked in the stairwell if he was left etc I thought

If one were to burglary in the wind or something like that there yes just

2319
03:38:11.160 --> 03:38:18.439

03:49:24.040 --> 03:49:27.439
in the same direction he comes from towards Til Centrum

2435
03:49:27.439 --> 03:49:32.520
Eh but then me and my colleagues are so close then that we can grab him and

2436
03:49:32.520 --> 03:49:38.800
put him down on the ground eh then we drag him away quite far

2437
03:49:38.800 --> 03:49:45.439
In the parking lot directly there as we do not know what it is that has laid eh

2438
03:49:45.439 --> 03:49:52.680
on the ground or whatever in the local area mm eh and visit him for

2439
03:49:52.680 --> 03:49:57.159
to see if one has something dangerous or otherwise on of interest

2440
03:49:57.159 --> 03:50:03.399
eh we post his mobile eh letter him on the ground

2441
03:50:03.399 --> 03:50:12.800
eh and a moment after he has been arrested eh so the screen lights up there eh

2442
03:50:12.800 --> 03:50:17.800
and it looks like it is a message received in any form

2443
03:50:17.800 --> 03:50:23.840
of app and that you get a note about it eh from whom it was what it says and there

2444
03:50:23.840 --> 03:50:31.399
can i read that it stands dead all eh can't see the username or i

2445
03:50:31.399 --> 03:50:35.000
don't remember that anyway

2446
03:50:35.640 --> 03:50:43.319
eh so that's what happens etc. what does he do on the spot then

2447
03:50:43.319 --> 03:50:47.520
So we arrived come back to the bike do new tagel so what what

2448
03:50:47.520 --> 03:50:54.000
then undertakes for something no it is hard to see eh as it is so

2449
03:50:54.000 --> 03:51:01.479
pass dark where eh those street lights do not really reach there

2450
03:51:01.479 --> 03:51:07.279
It is like the darkest place in the courtyard if you say m eh but he travel

2451
03:51:07.279 --> 03:51:13.920
He is on and pick up with some eh eh letter in the bike he has the bike yes

2452
03:51:13.920 --> 03:51:18.720
In front of him you can say when I come against him and then he is squatting

2453
03:51:18.720 --> 03:51:23.760
eh and like yes I don't see what he does but the feeling is that he is on

2454
03:51:23.760 --> 03:51:29.279
something there when he's a squat eh so he gets up from there when i call to

2455
03:51:29.279 --> 03:51:35.239
it is a police officer then mm and the place he stood squatting then there was something of

2456
03:51:35.239 --> 03:51:41.080
interest where s when k checking yes just because late we should check what

2457
03:51:41.080 --> 03:51:46.239
it is as actually being laid there at the entrance eh and then when we go in via a

2458
03:51:46.239 --> 03:51:52.880
another apartment to be able to look at hold eh then we see that at the bike eh so

2459
03:51:52.880 --> 03:52:01.199
is there a gasoline can a glycol unclear content in them and then also

2460
03:52:01.199 --> 03:52:07.479
a pet bottle that we see is filled with some kind of yes half -clear liquid what I

2461
03:52:07.479 --> 03:52:13.800
can remember mm eh unclear content it is with but we then suspect that it is

2462
03:52:13.800 --> 03:52:21.439
somewhat flammable or explosive etc. mainly flammable as mm was based

2463
03:52:21.439 --> 03:52:25.239
the circumstances of the scene now came those objects have been there already when

2464
03:52:25.239 --> 03:52:29.479
the parked bike or how do you look at it

2465
03:52:29.479 --> 03:52:34.760
thing eh no that they

2466
03:52:34.760 --> 03:52:41.800
Eh that we had seen we had I had been there for a good while and look there

2467
03:52:41.800 --> 03:52:47.600
eh so I would say that and we had also moved in the area so it had

2468
03:52:47.600 --> 03:52:54.680
stood a yes one than a pet bottle I could very well have missed but not

2469
03:52:54.680 --> 03:53:03.640
the red dunken no it had I seen etc. you have any idea how

2470
03:53:03.640 --> 03:53:07.279
long time it takes roughly from the time he comes to the place from that it

2471
03:53:07.279 --> 03:53:14.560
decides to intervene eh yes it goes pretty fast eh

2472
03:53:14.560 --> 03:53:19.040
comes cycling there and turns pretty straight away then everything happens in a

2473
03:53:19.040 --> 03:53:25.600
dense foals so from seeing him come cycling to

2474
03:53:25.600 --> 03:53:33.600
that he is actually arrested so one and a half minutes about maybe mm it goes

2475
03:53:33.600 --> 03:53:38.640
fast how long had you been at the site approximately and observed or

2476
03:53:38.640 --> 03:53:42.040
scouted as it is called

2477
03:53:42.159 --> 03:53:48.680
So at that particular position, then M had against the same gate if you say so

2478
03:53:48.680 --> 03:53:53.479
it v made yes just that yes but it had

2479
03:53:53.479 --> 03:54:00.800
were a few hours anyway etc. there would have been more people who heard in or

2480
03:54:00.800 --> 03:54:06.960
Had there been any somin except the gate time you stood there

2481
03:54:07.600 --> 03:54:14.840
Eh i know there were people moving outside but never to ell

2482
03:54:14.840 --> 03:54:24.319
Port without the gates letters I want to remember etc. Okay and but I am etc. but gates

2483
03:54:24.319 --> 03:54:30.359
BlÃ¶ did you say yes exactly mm What was it that made the decision to intervene against

2484
03:54:30.359 --> 03:54:36.359
This person then eh no but the behavior

2485
03:54:36.359 --> 03:54:45.840
eh both tien on the day and eh eh how he looks around even before he turned

2486
03:54:45.840 --> 03:54:52.520
eh made the gut feeling said it was interesting and then when he puts

2487
03:54:52.520 --> 03:54:58.319
themselves in yes in the darkest place but still near

2488
03:54:58.319 --> 03:55:05.680
number 28 where eh and put out some content in front of the entrance where it stands

2489
03:55:05.680 --> 03:55:12.000
well clear that we have to check reach MM a rather hypothetical question but you can

2490
03:55:12.000 --> 03:55:16.680
do the best yet I thought like this if there was any person who did not

2491
03:55:16.680 --> 03:55:21.399
shown a suspicious behavior that had, like, had gone towards the gate and entered there

2492
03:55:21.399 --> 03:55:27.439
Had that person also been checked you believe

2493
03:55:28.319 --> 03:55:35.880
Eh yes it will be very difficult and the threshing to check someone was

2494
03:55:35.880 --> 03:55:43.800
very low in this situation eh so eh

2495
03:55:44.760 --> 03:55:53.680
Yes it is, after all, it is difficult to say eh mm it is, after all it had come

2496
03:55:53.680 --> 03:56:00.520
Like yes no it is almost almost not possible and say risk I would

2497
03:56:00.520 --> 03:56:05.960
say the probability is very high that eh yes the first to come to

2498
03:56:05.960 --> 03:56:12.960
the gate current night and above all so late had been checked mm just

2499
03:56:12.960 --> 03:56:17.239
it ehm you had some tags to the gate

2500
03:56:17.239 --> 03:56:22.560
or reaching ways to get into this port number 28 eh I had it in

2501
03:56:22.560 --> 03:56:28.920
Any case no I understand how long was it thought you would stay

2502
03:56:28.920 --> 03:56:33.359
left about then on the spot it was like all night or was it

2503
03:56:33.359 --> 03:56:40.279
Mm yes v what i know we had no eh

2504
03:56:40.359 --> 03:56:47.760
eh restriction set or end time no it was good no but then exactly that i

2505
03:56:47.760 --> 03:56:53.479
thought about what has been spoken a little bit about fimples and dishes and the like so

2506
03:56:53.479 --> 03:56:56.840
The question is is there any one has been any person who has stood and smoked there

2507
03:56:56.840 --> 03:57:02.239
As you have seen eh not as I have seen no no and it

2508
03:57:02.239 --> 03:57:07.600
Here the person arrested have you seen any signs that he would have smoked or

2509
03:57:07.600 --> 03:57:11.560
handled cigarettes in some way

2510
03:57:12.000 --> 03:57:17.399
Eh yeah i know he i know he had liters on

2511
03:57:17.399 --> 03:57:25.640
Eh i can't remember now eh if he had cigarettes on but we

2512
03:57:25.640 --> 03:57:32.040
Wrote up eh eh what was found on him and

2513
03:57:32.040 --> 03:57:37.760
Things were also seized so it should be stated there etc. Yes but it does it he

2514
03:57:37.760 --> 03:57:43.359
did not smoke under yes while I observe him from the time he came

2515
03:57:43.359 --> 03:57:47.760
cycling until he was arrested so he didn't smoke anyway but liters I know

2516
03:57:47.760 --> 03:57:52.960
that he was wearing etc. yes but what good but then I'm done anyway then thanks

2526
03:58:35.239 --> 03:58:41.120
where what you usually usually do as a head not like this so put away there a little neighbor

2527
03:58:41.120 --> 03:58:45.199
As long as we get so that but prosecution will start to stand questions here m

2528
03:58:45.199 --> 03:58:49.399
well yes but thank you hello hi i have understood it as you work for

2529
03:58:49.399 --> 03:58:54.680
The social service as a social secretary is correct and this applies to the

2530
03:58:54.680 --> 03:59:01.800
October 7, 2023 yes eh I understand that you have worked then yes

2531
03:59:01.800 --> 03:59:06.359
Yes that is true we can tell you a little bit about what it was you would do and

2532
03:59:06.359 --> 03:59:11.600
what happened and possibly at a time so you did during this time eh we had

2533
03:59:11.600 --> 03:59:16.199
had talks with the police regarding yes but that it was a family that needs

2534
03:59:16.199 --> 03:59:21.439
protected that there was a threat so me and my colleague go out for

2535
03:59:21.439 --> 03:59:29.800
that yes but we shall protect a person eh we get okay by the police to go into

2536
03:59:29.800 --> 03:59:35.640
The area so we go in and stand in the parking lot that is quite close to where it

2537
03:59:35.640 --> 03:59:42.120
the person lives as we are going to pick up etc. when we sit in the car eh so we see

2538
03:59:42.120 --> 03:59:47.279
that there is a person outside the gate to the one where we are going to go in

2539
03:59:47.279 --> 03:59:53.199
eh so we wait to go out or go in there because we think yes it can

2540
03:59:53.199 --> 03:59:56.640
be who is standing where there is no need to be something but on the basis that we

2541
03:59:56.640 --> 03:59:59.920
knew it was ongoing threats so we thought we'll take it safe for

2542
03:59:59.920 --> 04:00:05.159
insecure and sitting left mm so we wait and it

2543
04:00:05.159 --> 04:00:11.279
maybe a quarter of the first direk taken what the way at about then I think

2544
04:00:11.279 --> 04:00:16.359
We roll into the area type at 22 something mm okay somewhere where give

2545
04:00:16.359 --> 04:00:20.279
and take yes no but eh and so wait okay so you wait 10 minutes quarter so

2546
04:00:20.279 --> 04:00:27.479
you yes but about mm eh and then so yes but the person stands yes but just not

2547
04:00:27.479 --> 04:00:31.479
in front of the gate without a bit on the side of as well as as

2548
04:00:31.479 --> 04:00:38.479
eh so we talk to a person in the house then eh and yes but first she says yes but

2549
04:00:38.479 --> 04:00:42.600
there maybe only a neighbor who is out smoking or something mm and we said but

2550
04:00:42.600 --> 04:00:49.319
We still await so until we know eh and then it will probably come

2551
04:00:49.319 --> 04:00:54.279
any other neighbor after a while and goes in and then this person joins into

2552
04:00:54.279 --> 04:01:01.199
the stairwell mm eh so yes but then we talk again with

2553
04:01:01.199 --> 04:01:05.359
the family that and like this await does not go out

2554
04:01:05.359 --> 04:01:12.880
eh and then so check yes but a person out of the keyhole and sees that it is not

2555
04:01:12.880 --> 04:01:19.399
some neighbor because they see the person going up and then goes down through to yes that

2556
04:01:19.399 --> 04:01:24.159
It comes up and we check for the gate where they live and then go down again

2557
04:01:24.159 --> 04:01:28.680
eh so me and my colleague after a while because then it goes down and there are some

2558
04:01:28.680 --> 04:01:33.040
minutes we think you might be someone who went in somewhere or yes mm so then

2559
04:01:33.040 --> 04:01:37.920
If we go out and then we pass as well as the gate just goes by and then

2560
04:01:37.920 --> 04:01:42.040
we turn and go back and then we see that there is a person as well as inside

2561
04:01:42.040 --> 04:01:47.760
The stairwell before dies as well as downstairs downstairs where it came in mm

2562
04:01:47.760 --> 04:01:54.080
Eh and yes but I think it's both we and mom call the police eh

2563
04:01:54.080 --> 04:02:01.880
based on situation etc. so yes so we go back and sit in the car and then

2564
04:02:01.880 --> 04:02:06.960
after a while so yes but will someone come and cycle past we do not think anymore

2565
04:02:06.960 --> 04:02:10.680
on it but we think we don't see if it comes from the house or not but that

2566
04:02:10.680 --> 04:02:16.399
bikes past a person yes eh and then so pole and check the stairwell and then it is

2567
04:02:16.399 --> 04:02:21.720
no one there exactly that yes when the person you observe then can

2568
04:02:21.720 --> 04:02:29.040
try to describe him to the seed yes but kind of normal length normal weight dark

2569
04:02:29.040 --> 04:02:34.120
pants either yes but dark jacket also either black or type dark blue

2570
04:02:34.120 --> 04:02:42.120
down jacket etc. dark shoes etc. This is where we see like yes age something like yes but

2571
04:02:42.120 --> 04:02:47.000
quite young around 20 years of age I guess mm mm mm hair color or something like that

2572
04:02:47.000 --> 04:02:50.920
can you observe so i don't think i see

2573
04:02:50.920 --> 04:02:54.760
The hair wonders if it is hood on or if it is but

2574
04:02:54.760 --> 04:02:59.960
mm spontaneous yes no I dare not really say it no but it is quiet you

2575
04:02:59.960 --> 04:03:05.439
eh just has his behavior in general is

2576
04:03:05.439 --> 04:03:09.120
that something that feels like feels like web or could it been

2577
04:03:09.120 --> 04:03:14.000
Anyone that but only that he stood in an inappropriate place right then

2578
04:03:14.000 --> 04:03:18.520
we experienced or I experienced like he was nervous it was like wandered

2579
04:03:18.520 --> 04:03:24.920
A little off and on and thus it felt like yes but nervous in the behavior etc.

2580
04:03:24.920 --> 04:03:32.040
Eh so M understands just that it said he followed someone reaching who lives there

2581
04:03:32.040 --> 04:03:36.439
inside the stairwell has any idea of how that person looked up it as

2582
04:03:36.439 --> 04:03:43.000
I said the one who lived in the house then no but long eh and kind of ward jacket on

2583
04:03:43.000 --> 04:03:49.279
or something with reflexes on just the dirty type yes but work pants something

2584
04:03:49.279 --> 04:03:55.439
such boots etc. mm just that

2585
04:03:55.880 --> 04:04:02.239
ehm just about when you see that guy in the tpp house you get any contact

2586
04:04:02.239 --> 04:04:08.040
or something then or no no no i don't know if he sees us like we

2587
04:04:08.040 --> 04:04:12.080
just walked by and then we turned and went back as well and saw that there was a

2588
04:04:12.080 --> 04:04:16.199
person there so then we thought we would not go in no exactly no but what should

2589
04:04:16.199 --> 04:04:20.439
When I get answers to my questions anyway etc. Thank you so much then Mother's Bet

2590
04:04:20.439 --> 04:04:25.000
TrÃ¤de gets the opportunity yes thank you also some questions you eh you told you here

2591
04:04:25.000 --> 04:04:29.840
about the threat picture that you got it there was against the family and contacts only

2592
04:04:29.840 --> 04:04:34.640
Too clear debt who in the family is what you have contact with it is the mother in

2593
04:04:34.640 --> 04:04:39.640
The family that I have contact with the mother etc. and

2594
04:04:39.640 --> 04:04:46.600
You also told us here that eh eh it was a sequence where you see that

2595
04:04:46.600 --> 04:04:50.840
A neighbor goes in and that a person follows in and that you then talk to

2596
04:04:50.840 --> 04:04:57.040
The family again etc. eh tells the mother about it is the mother you talk to too m mm

2597
04:04:57.040 --> 04:05:01.800
she tells if she has made any observations or yes but she sees then

2598
04:05:01.800 --> 04:05:05.920
For first she thinks that maybe just a neighbor or someone standing

2599
04:05:05.920 --> 04:05:11.439
Outside and smoke eh but then she sees that yes but then when we call and say

2600
04:05:11.439 --> 04:05:16.840
That a person has entered so type, she checks out through the peephole and sees

2601
04:05:16.840 --> 04:05:21.560
that a person comes up on the floor where she lives and is there a

2602
04:05:21.560 --> 04:05:25.159
tag and then goes down again and she did not recognize the person who says it is

2603
04:05:25.159 --> 04:05:32.000
no neighbor and get worried that she will be worried then mm so she would call

2604
04:05:32.000 --> 04:05:38.479
Police etc. just for my next question is and it's really about it

2605
04:05:38.479 --> 04:05:43.640
first contact when you inform about the threat picture and then ongoing contact

2606
04:05:43.640 --> 04:05:48.239
evening you can describe a little how what is your impression how does mom react

2607
04:05:48.239 --> 04:05:50.920
here the information she receives from you under

2608
04:05:50.920 --> 04:05:58.199
Tonight no but at first she is not so worried before we get there but

2609
04:05:58.199 --> 04:06:03.279
yes agree that, as we should make sure that the smallest child becomes

2610
04:06:03.279 --> 04:06:09.840
protected but then when she sees the person in the stairwell and does not recognize it

2611
04:06:09.840 --> 04:06:16.680
that when she gets yes you are experienced becomes very worried mm eh so and on which

2612
04:06:16.680 --> 04:06:22.520
way it is noticeable that they become very worried no but more but upheld or

2613
04:06:22.520 --> 04:06:26.000
Like so, S feels that I don't recognize this person there is no one

2614
04:06:26.000 --> 04:06:30.800
neighbor and he just came up and watched and yes that it was nasty so she would

2615
04:06:30.800 --> 04:06:37.720
call the police directly etc. and eh then I wonder too have you had

2616
04:06:37.720 --> 04:06:42.399
any more contact with the mother or someone else in the family after this

2617
04:06:42.399 --> 04:06:45.399
The event

2618
04:06:46.040 --> 04:06:51.319
Yes we had a follow -up call the day

2619
04:06:51.640 --> 04:06:59.560
After who participated in the conversation it was me and mom who talked then etc.

2620
04:06:59.560 --> 04:07:04.720
eh just to, like yes but tune in to the way it became and that they are protected

2621
04:07:04.720 --> 04:07:12.000
everyone and how was her state of mind then no but stressed

2622
04:07:12.000 --> 04:07:19.880
or but like worried etc. she told me something about how they

2623
04:07:19.880 --> 04:07:26.479
The other families had reacted to what has happened to what they were aware

2624
04:07:26.479 --> 04:07:31.880
If no then I think we just talk about as well as her experience and

2625
04:07:31.880 --> 04:07:37.840
since the smallest child as you say the one we had contact around it was

2626
04:07:37.840 --> 04:07:44.560
the conversation revolved around MM and as well as to make sure they all had come

2627
04:07:44.560 --> 04:07:50.640
to another place protected as well as so mm for the whole family then yes as yes etc.

2628
04:07:50.640 --> 04:07:54.720
exactly we have had a statement that one has stayed away from

2629
04:07:54.720 --> 04:08:00.680
The home for a period eh is something you know about yes yes but

2630
04:08:00.680 --> 04:08:07.159
I know then and then at least that they no one was left in after yes then I know

2631
04:08:07.159 --> 04:08:13.080
Not after the Deten but the day after I know at least etc. Thank you then I do not have

2643
04:09:15.880 --> 04:09:19.319
any further supplementary question on this

2644
04:09:19.319 --> 04:09:30.000
Yes yes we were at the place where I and a colleague sat in a building at

2645
04:09:30.000 --> 04:09:35.239
The address kept supervision I don't remember exactly what time

2646
04:09:35.239 --> 04:09:40.560
were eh there were a little people in motion late

2647
04:09:40.560 --> 04:09:49.279
comes a person on a bicycle eh who then stays outside a gate that we

2648
04:09:49.279 --> 04:09:55.359
sitting and watching mm eh and what I remember was that it was one

2649
04:09:55.359 --> 04:09:59.960
bicycle basket on the bike eh bike was well dark bike basket was

2650
04:09:59.960 --> 04:10:05.680
well black if I don't remember the wrong prime.se eh something is in the bike basket I

2651
04:10:05.680 --> 04:10:11.840
can't see what is something red and it is one he has a plastic bag one

2652
04:10:11.840 --> 04:10:18.760
Want a bag on the board eh stands for a little while outside a gate

2653
04:10:18.760 --> 04:10:24.560
If I don't remember wrong goes a few meters away eh we don't see what

2654
04:10:24.560 --> 04:10:30.319
he's doing right there then he goes back in front of the gate he puts down something

2655
04:10:30.319 --> 04:10:34.479
which is not at the moment or then can see what it is

2656
04:10:34.479 --> 04:10:39.920
eh then he goes back to his bike that stands a few meters away under a tree

2657
04:10:39.920 --> 04:10:44.760
and starts to do something where he sits down crouches down and does

2658
04:10:44.760 --> 04:10:49.560
something where eh then my colleague runs out and

2659
04:10:49.560 --> 04:10:53.199
together with other colleagues who are there

2660
04:10:53.199 --> 04:11:00.239
Eh yes grabs this person and I stand in this building and look

2661
04:11:00.239 --> 04:11:06.600
All the time because we leave some equipment there so I can't leave

2662
04:11:07.920 --> 04:11:14.479
Mm that's probably what I remember by that particular event etc. Absolutely great it is

2663
04:11:14.479 --> 04:11:18.119
just a control question there so there is no misunderstanding there when you

2664
04:11:18.119 --> 04:11:21.640
says it sees something red in the bicycle basket and that it sees a bag on

2665
04:11:21.640 --> 04:11:28.279
The board we talk about by definition different objects as yes exactly the bike basket sits

2666
04:11:28.279 --> 04:11:32.600
after all on the board and there is something red in the bike basket and then is

2667
04:11:32.600 --> 04:11:37.080
it a white plastic bag then as it says Willis on if I don't miss m on as

04:12:28.800 --> 04:12:32.239
applies to your observations then in connection with

The house search on FjÃ¤llvÃ¤gen in Uddevalla on October 8, 2023 you know which

be good but you can v tell yourself then first what yes but what happens

2683
04:12:56.399 --> 04:12:59.640
What observations are made for this occasion so maybe I put some

2684
04:12:59.640 --> 04:13:05.640
supplementary questions on it late yes thank you eh i together with colleague then make a

2685
04:13:05.640 --> 04:13:11.319
Husak on FjÃ¤llvÃ¤gen 28E Eh and the apartment then at

2686
04:13:11.319 --> 04:13:17.960
the ground floor eh eh and even then in associated storage then on the same plane

2687
04:13:17.960 --> 04:13:26.319
Eh and this store is empty and there is a bathtub in I in this

2688
04:13:26.319 --> 04:13:33.439
the storage room but nothing else eh you are doing some kind of work

2689
04:13:33.439 --> 04:13:37.199
with ventilation drums in in itself

2690
04:13:37.199 --> 04:13:43.159
the apartment there so yes it looks a bit like a construction site to some extent in

2691
04:13:43.159 --> 04:13:47.279
and so on ehm and

2692
04:13:47.279 --> 04:13:54.080
eh yes we are in this one and always now we just this assignment we have

2693
04:13:54.080 --> 04:13:59.080
really no more knowledge that we will then make the house the case for

2694
04:13:59.080 --> 04:14:05.000
eh in Uddevalla we do not own the case but the Ã–rebro case and we have very

2695
04:14:05.000 --> 04:14:10.279
scarce information in what has otherwise happened but we will do h.

2696
04:14:10.279 --> 04:14:17.000
at least mm ehm it is the apartment itself so it is

2697
04:14:17.000 --> 04:14:23.000
A little disorder in this apartment as there is some clothes holes and noise eh

2698
04:14:23.000 --> 04:14:30.119
There is a lot of disk there is a little flip boxes eh eh it says a big tvl

2699
04:14:30.119 --> 04:14:35.600
Ã…da in the apartment and no television but we get it later that it stands after all

2700
04:14:35.600 --> 04:14:41.680
Outside the apartment m When we do house things, we always lock the apartments

2701
04:14:41.680 --> 04:14:47.880
so that no one then comes in eh but all of a sudden a person comes into

2702
04:14:47.880 --> 04:14:57.239
the apartment and then with own key eh and we identify this person

2703
04:14:57.239 --> 04:15:04.399
eh no weirdness he behaves in a good and and pleasant way toward

2704
04:15:04.399 --> 04:15:09.760
us eh and his name is Leon then

2705
04:15:09.760 --> 04:15:16.920
Alfredsson he had no identification with him there without we do

2706
04:15:17.040 --> 04:15:20.040
Dataslayer

2707
04:15:25.450 --> 04:15:28.620
[Music]

2708
04:15:32.119 --> 04:15:39.159
Even a hearing with him that is documented on who sees dies then

2709
04:15:39.159 --> 04:15:45.040
ehm he then demonstrates that he has exhibited this TV for a one -camera

2710
04:15:45.040 --> 04:15:51.000
would pick up this TV later and it is then eh under a lake and that

2711
04:15:51.000 --> 04:15:57.359
is just outside in the stairwell and there is also a one bag and this one

2712
04:15:57.359 --> 04:16:03.399
The contents of the bag is, among other things, a black suit a white shirt a white tie

2713
04:16:03.399 --> 04:16:13.199
and there were some fine shoes there in size 41 Eh a confirmation Bible etc. and h

2714
04:16:13.199 --> 04:16:21.279
computer in a one computer bag eh then there was also some empty patrol sleeve there and that

2715
04:16:21.279 --> 04:16:29.040
Here, after all, EH is taken and we use Vilh Skar Le he would like to

2716
04:16:29.040 --> 04:16:32.800
look in this bag but he must not do it because he wonders if it was

2717
04:16:32.800 --> 04:16:41.439
something that belonged to him but but VSK can then seize it

2718
04:16:41.439 --> 04:16:49.800
eh to named eh we he knew that his friend then

2719
04:16:49.800 --> 04:16:57.439
Leon Kg Rik was arrested there and that information he had received from

2720
04:16:57.439 --> 04:17:02.960
Media and yes I thought it felt a little unclear why this one

2721
04:17:02.960 --> 04:17:08.760
the bag was packed with all belongings and why it was then

2722
04:17:08.760 --> 04:17:18.040
a one suit and a Bible and eh yes with white tie and a cartridge sleeve it was yes

2723
04:17:18.040 --> 04:17:24.800
A little unusual things I think eh then there were probably two mobile phones

2724
04:17:24.800 --> 04:17:30.199
there that was out some older model and some shaver but they cannot

2725
04:17:30.199 --> 04:17:35.319
say that I remember if it lay in that bag or if he wore them in

2726
04:17:35.319 --> 04:17:43.040
jacket or otherwise I don't know that but it was there was some kind

2727
04:17:43.040 --> 04:17:49.239
phone and so on we film this apartment and so there is well in i i

2728
04:17:49.239 --> 04:17:58.159
the case where eh I also have a hearing with

2729
04:17:58.159 --> 04:18:05.479
with Leon on site there and I don't really know about I will read

2730
04:18:05.479 --> 04:18:10.600
the interrogation or say because I think you have access to this

2731
04:18:10.600 --> 04:18:17.439
the interrogation eh where eh we have and you I thought about one

2732
04:18:17.439 --> 04:18:23.439
thing this bag now with the suit and confirmation Bible and you got any

2733
04:18:23.439 --> 04:18:29.119
information about like who would have packed this bag yes I took it

2734
04:18:29.119 --> 04:18:36.479
Like that it was Leon Alfredsson then who would have packed down some things

2735
04:18:36.479 --> 04:18:44.439
as which would then be eh eh good

2736
04:18:44.439 --> 04:18:52.159
eh for for eh to his friend then etc. so it was he who had exhibited it was

2737
04:18:52.159 --> 04:18:55.920
So as I perceived yes just that

2738
04:18:55.920 --> 04:19:01.159
ehm and the friend was it v who was it was it was located insered or where someone

2739
04:19:01.159 --> 04:19:06.000
other who was intended no no the buddy as he had

2740
04:19:06.000 --> 04:19:12.000
packed the bag and so was his clothes and so on in this one

2741
04:19:12.000 --> 04:19:19.680
The bag it was Leo he I call Leo KÃ¤g rustic then just that

2742
04:19:19.680 --> 04:19:22.680
just

2743
04:19:23.159 --> 04:19:28.840
ehm said something about why he now maybe we will not be on for but say

2744
04:19:28.840 --> 04:19:33.399
anything about why he has packed this bag then what the purpose

2745
04:19:33.399 --> 04:19:38.720
with yes eh eh I for me and wrote it

2746
04:19:38.720 --> 04:19:44.760
somewhere in either in the ear

2747
04:19:44.760 --> 04:19:55.199
eh or if it was in PMet where I can't pick it out of my memory there

2748
04:19:55.199 --> 04:20:00.800
But but out I think he said so in case it would happen to him something

2749
04:20:00.800 --> 04:20:05.359
prime.se yes I understand

2750
04:20:05.359 --> 04:20:10.840
eh heard right that it said he knew that something had happened too

2751
04:20:10.840 --> 04:20:19.760
With yes he had taken part in via media just that yes but it hard and so

2752
04:20:19.760 --> 04:20:24.680
had he figured out that it must be him because he then knew he had

2753
04:20:24.680 --> 04:20:28.680
went to Ã–rebro just that yes but what good no but

2754
04:20:28.680 --> 04:20:32.640

04:20:36.319 --> 04:20:41.560
Opportunity here lawyer Larsson Lawyer Atta Seen No Thanks to Lawyer Bokelund Yes

2757
04:20:41.560 --> 04:20:47.159
Thanks Yes Hi Lawyer Charlotte Boklund Hello

2758
04:20:47.159 --> 04:20:52.840
Charlott I would just like to ask some questions if we've seen this

2759
04:20:52.840 --> 04:20:56.040
The hearing in

2760
04:20:56.720 --> 04:21:05.439
The preliminary investigation protocol 83 84 Eh he tells Leon Eh Alfredsson then

2761
04:21:05.439 --> 04:21:12.880
anything about any crime being committed or would be committed

2762
04:21:12.880 --> 04:21:21.720
In the actual hearing etc. but he he he said that yes I almost have to look in for

2763
04:21:21.720 --> 04:21:27.119
penny because i can't pick it out do you do it because it says there on page 83 yes

2764
04:21:27.119 --> 04:21:31.279
I don't have the page references in those eh because I don't have the preliminary investigation

2765
04:21:31.279 --> 04:21:37.800
in front of me there but yes but he says it thinks that witness should not look in

2766
04:21:37.800 --> 04:21:43.080
the hearing there without it without it you may try if you don't remember then you get

2767
04:21:43.080 --> 04:21:48.359
so try to put away pap there and is it that the lawyer may ask a question and

2768
04:21:48.359 --> 04:21:53.159
If you do not remember then the lawyer must consider whether to request to be read

2769
04:21:53.159 --> 04:21:58.560
up here eh but have i written then in the interview

2770
04:21:58.560 --> 04:22:03.760
So it was as he said in the interrogation etc.

2771
04:22:03.760 --> 04:22:12.880
Eh but what I remember it was that Leon Alfredsson in interrogation says that

2772
04:22:12.880 --> 04:22:20.720
he had been waiting to get some kind of assignment so he was like ready to

2773
04:22:20.720 --> 04:22:27.479
go to go where would he go you mean no sorry leon

2774
04:22:27.479 --> 04:22:33.479
Rustig had been waiting to get a mission eh and so he went to

2775
04:22:33.479 --> 04:22:38.880
Ã–rebro yes so he he reports it and says that

2776
04:22:38.880 --> 04:22:45.319
Then sorry now I don't hear that reports it that he had received a

2777
04:22:45.319 --> 04:22:52.119
mission to commit a crime no not just no a mission

2778
04:22:52.119 --> 04:22:57.239
So I remember it was not to commit a crime just but he is waiting to get

2779
04:22:57.239 --> 04:22:59.880
go on

2780
04:23:00.000 --> 04:23:05.239
something yes and how did you interpret

2781
04:23:05.520 --> 04:23:11.640
it yes you can yes something then because it was

2782
04:23:11.640 --> 04:23:17.960
A crime time so no it is very difficult to and guess eh what young people

2783
04:23:17.960 --> 04:23:26.520
have for intentions with what they want g but you do not establish any notification of

2784
04:23:26.520 --> 04:23:33.000
that if I set up any notification no I have not done no

2785
04:23:33.000 --> 04:23:42.640
you are talking about something about you and Leon Alfsson and regarding this eh

2786
04:23:42.640 --> 04:23:45.560
The hearing should be

2787
04:23:45.720 --> 04:23:54.880
Secret no it is not that the hearing should be secret but but Leon Alfredsson

2788
04:23:54.880 --> 04:24:00.199
Don't want to stand for in interrogation who this one

2789
04:24:00.199 --> 04:24:07.520
the client is no, there is something mentioned about it

2790
04:24:07.520 --> 04:24:16.720
clients yes i leon he he is the pictures from an instagram account

2791
04:24:16.720 --> 04:24:28.399
eh on a guy who is then called the account is Hanko at Insta this guy will

2792
04:24:28.399 --> 04:24:34.680
hot hamsa and it should be this eh hamsa

2793
04:24:34.680 --> 04:24:42.640
then as who has given the mission itself it is something like Leon that

2794
04:24:42.640 --> 04:24:49.720
says my yes I show pictures and they have also attached

2795
04:24:49.720 --> 04:24:56.080
the investigation said something that it would be secret they

2796
04:24:56.080 --> 04:25:01.199
information yes he he did not want to stand for them in interrogation

2797
04:25:01.199 --> 04:25:06.439
Yes it was promised then that it would be secret

2798
04:25:06.439 --> 04:25:13.000
Eh yes there and then so he wanted them home

2799
04:25:13.000 --> 04:25:21.119
so to say so it was handled through tips but then it is enrolled in

2800
04:25:21.119 --> 04:25:26.920
because yes because, as I perceived from the investigator, that he was standing for the duties

2801
04:25:26.920 --> 04:25:30.560
later in [music]

2802
04:25:30.560 --> 04:25:35.600

04:27:28.520 --> 04:27:36.319
Yeah had a man inside that tanks a gasoline can

2824
04:27:36.399 --> 04:27:45.800

04:27:45.800 --> 04:27:49.800
do it is so long see it is hard to come

2826
04:27:49.800 --> 04:27:56.720
remember mm mm I understand but is there nothing that

2827
04:27:56.720 --> 04:28:02.119
you remember regarding where the purchase that stood out from as you thought of

2828
04:28:02.119 --> 04:28:06.920
then no, not directly

2829
04:28:06.920 --> 04:28:12.640
so no ok is something else you mine from

2830
04:28:12.640 --> 04:28:18.230
this purchase and as today thus

2831
04:28:18.230 --> 04:28:24.000
[Music] mm Yes I think he asked if I

2832
04:28:24.000 --> 04:28:30.840
had dunks mm eh but

2833
04:28:30.840 --> 04:28:39.840
eh eh so I don't remind if he bought or if he the idea of the can had

2834
04:28:39.840 --> 04:28:43.840
found okay

2835
04:28:44.239 --> 04:28:47.340
mins about it gord reach observations about by him before

2836
04:28:47.340 --> 04:28:51.560
[Music] he before remembers if you made any

2837
04:28:51.560 --> 04:28:55.840
observations of him before when he entered the store

2838
04:28:55.840 --> 04:28:58.840
eh

2839
04:29:01.000 --> 04:29:06.840
No, but he he thinks something anyway has asked for some dunk

2840
04:29:06.840 --> 04:29:13.359
Yes yes that's where I remember yes okay but you you have held a hearing with you

2841
04:29:13.359 --> 04:29:16.600
Given that you don't remember so much today so get okay with right so I thought

2842
04:29:16.600 --> 04:29:22.720
just double check on things there is on eh san 30 in the interrogation of an interrogation

2843
04:29:22.720 --> 04:29:30.720
As held on October 11 eh on SÃ¶der MPL just mm then you have received

2844
04:29:30.720 --> 04:29:36.080
tell me freely what you saw and experienced and then it was noted as he went

2845
04:29:36.080 --> 04:29:43.000
around looking in the trash can outside is something you remember today

2846
04:29:43.000 --> 04:29:50.720
No nothing i remember no then you come into the shop check around a bit pick on

2847
04:29:50.720 --> 04:29:54.680
paper and check at the mobile accessories there is something you

2848
04:29:54.680 --> 04:30:01.720
remember no he wanted an empty thump but I

2849
04:30:01.720 --> 04:30:07.560
said I can buy one that we have talked about this thunken prime crime dse yes yes

2850
04:30:07.560 --> 04:30:14.279
But that was the question of whether it was so I said so it was just that you give you

2851
04:30:14.279 --> 04:30:18.960
out dunkers if they ask for or is it so that you can buy it one

2852
04:30:18.960 --> 04:30:24.880
Instead, eh yes you can buy but sometimes it can stand empty cans

2853
04:30:24.880 --> 04:30:32.960
outside in the trash cans or so exactly that yes but I understand

2854
04:30:33.920 --> 04:30:40.920
ehm he asked if we had TMA cans on the layer glycol when found outside

2855
04:30:40.920 --> 04:30:45.760
The garbage can stand it s is something that sounds familiar

2856
04:30:45.760 --> 04:30:50.680
Mm yes it is difficult to remember it is so

2857
04:30:50.680 --> 04:30:57.040
long see and mm you have a lot of customers and mm so you have someone do you have any

2858
04:30:57.040 --> 04:31:04.359
Feeling for whether it deals with any more bottle or can than just the one that

2859
04:31:04.359 --> 04:31:08.520
you sell at the station

2860
04:31:08.520 --> 04:31:13.520
No no h

2861
04:31:13.520 --> 04:31:19.279
As it stands here I said he can buy empty cans and then he took

2862
04:31:19.279 --> 04:31:23.479
a f liter thunk and asked if one could bring

2863
04:31:31.670 --> 04:31:34.719
[Music]

2864
04:31:39.319 --> 04:31:43.760
glycol poisoned with the police where we can tune in a little neighbor did you tell

2865
04:31:43.760 --> 04:31:48.239
that you remembered then or is it something that you kept in with or that you laid

2866
04:31:48.239 --> 04:31:54.920
to as you remember no I had looked at

2867
04:31:54.920 --> 04:32:00.439
video movie mhm okay so d had you fished up the memory

2868
04:32:00.439 --> 04:32:06.520
before then before yes okay yes but then so and when did you see that movie and were

2869
04:32:06.520 --> 04:32:11.000
the same day you talked to the police or was it before at some time eh no

2870
04:32:11.000 --> 04:32:17.319
the same okay but then so this person now was something special about

2871
04:32:17.319 --> 04:32:24.640
him as otherwise his person who otherwise thought now that yes it looked at

2872
04:32:24.840 --> 04:32:30.439
memory no not what i can remember now no

2873
04:32:30.439 --> 04:32:36.359
No yes because then there is also recorded here in that company there then that I have difficulty

2874
04:32:36.359 --> 04:32:42.439
to put words into it but it was something I felt was scary with him

2875
04:32:42.439 --> 04:32:46.840
mm it can be true then yes so it is nothing I will

2876
04:32:46.840 --> 04:32:53.199
Remember now that I felt but was v a feeling then just that

2877
04:32:54.439 --> 04:32:58.560
ehm then so this is on I will not read so much but only

2878
04:32:58.560 --> 04:33:02.720
a little neighbor here I stood at the checkout and checked that he refueled and that he

2879
04:33:02.720 --> 04:33:07.561
Went from there people usually tell why you think up thumps for example to

2880
04:33:07.561 --> 04:33:11.959
they got a motor stop or similar I got feeling that he was not injured f that

2881
04:33:11.959 --> 04:33:17.879
fill up a car it was a bit more but that so it recorded it can be true

2882
04:33:17.879 --> 04:33:23.760
Lucky yes I don't know why I had that feeling it's hard to remember

2883
04:33:23.760 --> 04:33:31.480
Why I thought so no exactly yes because it says KÃ¤n also then only a foam

2884
04:33:31.480 --> 04:33:38.000
Feeling and I remembered he stuck out so it maybe a little there later

2885
04:33:38.000 --> 04:33:43.039
Have you been asked yes sorry then have asked if you have seen the man

2886
04:33:43.039 --> 04:33:49.760
Before, you remember what v you answer to that

2887
04:33:49.760 --> 04:33:55.719
No yes the answer was that you had not seen him before then one last thing here

2888
04:33:55.719 --> 04:33:59.119
Actually eh

2889
04:33:59.119 --> 04:34:03.879
ehm there is recorded here too since 31 where I got a feeling that it

2890
04:34:03.879 --> 04:34:10.160
possibly was affected by something I don't have very good control of drugs

2891
04:34:10.160 --> 04:34:15.600
m Yes no as I said I don't know I know

2892
04:34:15.600 --> 04:34:19.600
not how this person is in normal cases either so

2893
04:34:19.600 --> 04:34:27.160
No it is at least sorry yes no it no mm it is at least here now

2894
04:34:27.160 --> 04:34:32.600
that that read and approved this for the ear that a telephone interview also has

2895
04:34:32.600 --> 04:34:37.080

2896
04:34:37.080 --> 04:34:46.760
that they yes v you will ih call before mm yes okay yes but then so then it is not

2897
04:34:46.760 --> 04:34:52.600

2898
04:34:52.600 --> 04:34:59.160

04:40:00.520 --> 04:40:07.638
says something in the style of you can keep the money standing this is would direct

2952
04:40:07.638 --> 04:40:13.520
over money to the guy in the car no I will not h no eh it was long see

2953
04:40:13.520 --> 04:40:18.320
I don't remember I can't sit here and g I don't remember you don't remember

2954
04:40:18.320 --> 04:40:22.920
That is calm but I but I think like this now when you talked to the police

2955
04:40:22.920 --> 04:40:28.400
Then October 17th you think you are better mines then than you do today what did you say

2956
04:40:28.400 --> 04:40:33.160
When you talked to the police here for what we f police interrogation and it was 17

2957
04:40:33.160 --> 04:40:40.040
October exactly yes did you take that you remembered better then than you do today it was

2958
04:40:40.040 --> 04:40:44.718
long ago because I don't really remember everything that has happened

2959
04:40:44.718 --> 04:40:49.160
for I have driven many people every time yes yes no but I understand no

2960
04:40:49.160 --> 04:40:55.718
But for now it is now it is April 26 today huh and we talked about an event

2961
04:40:55.718 --> 04:41:00.878
then as on October 7 It is quite a long time see back that I understand too

2962
04:41:00.878 --> 04:41:05.878
But this police interview it was then on October 17 it was a little closer in the time

2963
04:41:05.878 --> 04:41:10.958
So my question is like this when you have described this that she left behind

2964
04:41:10.958 --> 04:41:17.320
money to the guy do you think you remembered when the trip better then than you do

2965
04:41:17.320 --> 04:41:24.360
today eh i don't really remember no no okay no okay but if we say this way then

2966
04:41:24.360 --> 04:41:29.638
When you talk to the police M told you what you knew or found on something

2967
04:41:29.638 --> 04:41:33.798
do you think or did you tell me that as you knew I told me what has

2968
04:41:33.798 --> 04:41:43.280
Happened from in my car what has happened in my car to what is s seal yes I

2969
04:41:43.280 --> 04:41:46.680
don't know these people I don't know where they come from no I have

2970
04:41:46.680 --> 04:41:51.520
no one related to them has nothing with them no they have the being customer as if you

2971
04:41:51.520 --> 04:41:59.798
would jump into taxi the same thing for you yes no but okay no but i understand you

2972
04:42:01.878 --> 04:42:07.280
eh do you remember something else about these people there was something

2973
04:42:07.280 --> 04:42:12.040
As you thought was as which was worth putting on

2974
04:42:12.040 --> 04:42:18.600
Memory they were they were nice they were not so stingy such stuff no eh she

2975
04:42:18.600 --> 04:42:24.878
sat down she talked on the phone she had phone in hand etc. as i mins

2976
04:42:24.878 --> 04:42:31.760
Just that yes but this person sitting behind was quiet he was quiet I remember

2977
04:42:31.760 --> 04:42:36.680
It was you were you person I said marte nothing

2978
04:42:36.680 --> 04:42:41.600
No you remember anything about what she was talking about on the phone no I remember

2979
04:42:41.600 --> 04:42:47.440
not no because you have received a question too is it at late 33 and then it stood

2980
04:42:47.440 --> 04:42:53.360
So here she talked about something if someone had spun money I didn't hear that

2981
04:42:53.360 --> 04:43:00.040
a lot yes i didn't hear okay i talked on the phone she she said eh like me

2982
04:43:00.040 --> 04:43:05.160
mins something if someone had taken h money or she has taken h reach as I

2983
04:43:05.160 --> 04:43:12.520
don't really remember but if s okay yes just that and then you said you don't have that

2984
04:43:12.520 --> 04:43:17.320
Very check it was ordinary customers for you who paid and were not stuck but

2985
04:43:17.320 --> 04:43:22.040
Did you say you had been asked this way what did you get for the feeling of the people and then

2986
04:43:22.040 --> 04:43:26.240
have you described like this as the police recorded what I got the feeling that

2987
04:43:26.240 --> 04:43:30.920
The woman was doing drugs I can be wrong but it was my feeling the guy was

2988
04:43:30.920 --> 04:43:38.360
quiet and just sat behind what do you think around it yes because it smells cigarette on

2989
04:43:38.360 --> 04:43:42.760
her yeah yeah ok it was what made you

2990
04:43:42.760 --> 04:43:46.958
thought it was the dog yes I thought it is something it is not like usual

2991
04:43:46.958 --> 04:43:54.840
person you see on the street always okay it was just that okay yes I understand

2992
04:43:54.840 --> 04:44:01.440
But the most important thing here that I ENT wanted to know it was, above all, to with

2993
04:44:01.440 --> 04:44:06.160
If h leave any money but it didn't remember then if you had done no

2994
04:44:06.160 --> 04:44:11.360
I am going to be honest i remind not no no but okay it understands you can be then

2995

2997
04:44:24.240 --> 04:44:29.240
well eh hello BjÃ¶rn Andersson lawyer I just wanted to ask you off with full

2998
04:44:29.240 --> 04:44:32.520
respect that there has been some time eh that it may not be easy to come

2999
04:44:32.520 --> 04:44:39.320
Remember what the taxi ride was paid the woman for Taxiresan USFF that it was

3000
04:44:39.320 --> 04:44:43.760
250 I think just right and then I ask an even more difficult question will

3001
04:44:43.760 --> 04:44:47.360
you remember which denominations she pays with what so you can remember which denominations

3002
04:44:47.360 --> 04:44:53.600
she paid by what do you mean by you can pay SEK 250 in different ways edge we

3003
04:44:53.600 --> 04:44:59.360
spoke 200 200 and then 50 kpp yes almost in

3004
04:44:59.360 --> 04:45:04.320
The hearing on page 303 you get asked how paid the woman

3005
04:45:04.320 --> 04:45:11.120
And the guy for the trip then it is in cash I got 100 100 20 20 SEK yes

3006
04:45:11.120 --> 04:45:16.798
I think I don't really remember yes it can be so 100 dogs yes because she

3007
04:45:16.798 --> 04:45:21.080
asked Afta gear yes I remember now yes she asked decrease gear I had gear

3008
04:45:21.080 --> 04:45:25.958
Yes but good it is fully understandable yes remember eh when you meet these

3009
04:45:25.958 --> 04:45:32.798
the people at the central and they and they eh book the trip or explain where they

3010
04:45:32.798 --> 04:45:37.240
Should you say you should go toward Duble, you remember what the woman says about she

3011
04:45:37.240 --> 04:45:43.160
leaving any address or similar no they did not book taxi it came from

3012
04:45:43.160 --> 04:45:47.798
Press agency kept eh and since we stood we i don't know if you've been to the central

3013
04:45:47.798 --> 04:45:51.480
It stood like taxis and since I was the farthest away

3014
04:45:51.480 --> 04:45:57.638
last k just but to you the woman said any address or similar no they said

3015
04:45:57.638 --> 04:46:02.798
How they expressed eh first they said in Til and then changed the ones I think I

3016
04:46:02.798 --> 04:46:08.360
think maybe they don't recognize how Ã–rebro is eh as soon as we arrived at

3017
04:46:08.360 --> 04:46:13.958
The petrol station where they saw eh said they can you can you stay over there

3018
04:46:13.958 --> 04:46:19.440
Just that I had to stay then when you don't fully remember I would like to read

3019
04:46:19.440 --> 04:46:24.320
what you say at the bottom of page 32 it's almost the last line before one one

3020
04:46:24.320 --> 04:46:28.718
Ask coming there then it says like this she said something with helmets but I

3021
04:46:28.718 --> 04:46:33.718
Don't remember exactly no number she said then she changes to Circle K yes it

3022
04:46:33.718 --> 04:46:39.680
are helmets, of course we get exactly the helmets the way this one goes up just

3023
04:46:39.680 --> 04:46:43.920
It yes so it was there may have been that she has mentioned helmets or helmets

3024
04:46:43.920 --> 04:46:52.840
the road or something so i good they are two in the car they talk to each other no like me

3025
04:46:52.840 --> 04:47:00.160
said she talked on the phone yes eh the other person sat back was quiet just yes you

3026
04:47:00.160 --> 04:47:05.400
Don't hear anything talking to each other during the trip no no yes thank you it was mine

3027
04:47:05.400 --> 04:47:12.520
questions etc. Thank you so much then before end we turn off recording

3028
04:47:12.638 --> 04:47:15.958
We do this even now and then the recording was up and then is

3029
04:47:15.958 --> 04:47:19.680
the witness's foreweck with Morgan Boje and it is the prosecutor who sits here who has BÃ¤rt

3030
04:47:19.680 --> 04:47:23.480
That you will be interrogated so he will start asking questions and then will

3031
04:47:23.480 --> 04:47:28.360
goals enter and all the defenders here in turn are given the opportunity to set

3032
04:47:28.360 --> 04:47:33.440
Questions but go may start please thank you hello eh you should be heard about two things

3033
04:47:33.440 --> 04:47:37.440
Actually the first is about the observation on Tulegatan 28 then so

3034
04:47:37.440 --> 04:47:42.520
it is also about the arrest of Hamads Vanan then as S to PM about but if we

3035
04:47:42.520 --> 04:47:47.400
Starting with in TNA on Tat 28 so I would like you to tell yourself what you

3036
04:47:47.400 --> 04:47:53.160
do there and what you see at the site eh I work as an intervention scout

3037
04:47:53.160 --> 04:47:59.240
thus fully civilly dressed but also intervenes as intervention police eh in our

3038
04:47:59.240 --> 04:48:03.840
service we work primarily against serious violent crimes and drug offenses in

3039
04:48:03.840 --> 04:48:10.280
the foundation the assignment we received was that a family or address could be risky

3040
04:48:10.280 --> 04:48:15.840
for any kind of act of violence I did not know exactly what they could become

3041
04:48:15.840 --> 04:48:20.878
exposed to but they had some kind of threat picture of themselves

3042
04:48:20.878 --> 04:48:24.760
Eh i together with my colleagues [music]

3043
04:48:24.760 --> 04:48:32.638
eh simply watches this address hidden eh i have information to eh look

3044
04:48:32.638 --> 04:48:37.920
At the entrance Tylegatan now I do not remember exactly the current one

3045
04:48:37.920 --> 04:48:44.878
the address if it is 28an or 30 trvis 2 28 yes eh i have at least the task to

3046
04:48:44.878 --> 04:48:54.360
keep track of that gate eh and we an occasion then a man comes on a bike

3047
04:48:54.360 --> 04:49:02.520
eh he parks the bike between 28 and 30 Eh and goes straight in then to the current card

3048
04:49:02.520 --> 04:49:08.760
eh number 28 then eh and exactly he just goes straight in and like he should

3049
04:49:08.760 --> 04:49:13.040
go straight into the entrance eh but he starts jerking in the door and then realizes that it is

3050
04:49:13.040 --> 04:49:19.400
locked eh just there we react because eh you live there or are visiting so should

3051
04:49:19.400 --> 04:49:27.840
man v know them if it eh is unlocked eh this man is then between

3052
04:49:27.840 --> 04:49:35.600
Gate 28 and 30 for a long time frequently he stands and eh pills with his

3053
04:49:35.600 --> 04:49:43.000
phone and smoke eh yes you feel nervous he rarely stands he goes

3054
04:49:43.000 --> 04:49:48.638
back and forth and eh yes but we react to him

3055
04:49:48.638 --> 04:49:57.040
eh then on one occasion when he stands the poet's gate at 28an eh or very

3056
04:49:57.040 --> 04:50:03.760
Close to connection, there will be two Soss secretaries later but at this stage

3057
04:50:03.760 --> 04:50:08.558
do we only see two women to go to this gate so they go toward 28an and

3058
04:50:08.558 --> 04:50:12.718
Then when they see this man so they turn o and go away a few hundred

3059
04:50:12.718 --> 04:50:17.400
meters and we didn't really understand what happened there but in conjunction with it

3060
04:50:17.400 --> 04:50:23.480
calls in to 112 a call from the social services that two women have thought

3061
04:50:23.480 --> 04:50:28.558
go into the gate but they thought this man felt uncomfortable mm

3062
04:50:28.558 --> 04:50:33.878
eh so it confirmed like our feeling that this man behaves

3063
04:50:33.878 --> 04:50:37.120
differently on the spot

3064
04:50:37.520 --> 04:50:43.798
eh the women go from there without and go into the gate man

3065
04:50:43.798 --> 04:50:48.240
continues to stay out of the gate and in conjunction with this during the evening has

3066
04:50:48.240 --> 04:50:53.320
We also seen a guy with a warning jacket who goes in and out of the gate eh several

3067
04:50:53.320 --> 04:50:58.558
times eh will mika throw and in and out and when we we judged him as a

3068
04:50:58.558 --> 04:51:03.760
accommodation at at the address and on one occasion then this guy comes

3069
04:51:03.760 --> 04:51:09.040
With with warning jacket eh and then start talking to this one

3070
04:51:09.040 --> 04:51:14.200
the man standing outside eh we don't know what was said between

3071
04:51:14.200 --> 04:51:20.000
But they only exchanged a few words and then the notice of the eh lined man in

3072
04:51:20.000 --> 04:51:24.718
the gate and this unknown guy go after into the gate

3073
04:51:24.718 --> 04:51:29.400
eh so we interpreted as he was talking to him and asks if he could hang

3074
04:51:29.400 --> 04:51:36.520
me in simply m then takes about 10o minutes eh I want to remember eh and

3075
04:51:36.520 --> 04:51:42.558
Then this guy comes out again eh and he sits on his bike and ride

3076
04:51:42.558 --> 04:51:48.160
from the place you before leaving this one

3077
04:51:48.160 --> 04:51:53.920
The sequence you have to find out about how we this bike is locked or

3078
04:51:53.920 --> 04:51:59.600
unlocked it so safely in pm if i have seen that observation or not eh it

3079
04:51:59.600 --> 04:52:05.120
stands in PMet the second last paragraph San 38 here yes

3080
04:52:05.120 --> 04:52:09.638
that okay so you just fish the witness his memory here as he goes out from Aden locks

3081
04:52:09.638 --> 04:52:15.520
up the bike and Ã… from the site went up to the university hall then it is good

3082
04:52:15.520 --> 04:52:20.638
I have written the PM to direct connection so I can refer to it

3083
04:52:20.638 --> 04:52:27.558
Eh he cycles from there eh we get assignments from those who own

3084
04:52:27.558 --> 04:52:32.360
the effort that we should not control him so he disappears to unknown

3085
04:52:32.360 --> 04:52:38.798
place then the hours go during the night and really nothing else is observed as

3086
04:52:38.798 --> 04:52:44.558
have with the case to do eh i'm just going to get off my pass eh

3087
04:52:44.558 --> 04:52:50.878
and other colleagues will take on and exactly when we have largely

3088
04:52:50.878 --> 04:52:56.558
landed, I hear the effort that it becomes an intervention by a person

3089
04:52:56.558 --> 04:53:02.558
Just that and then in a chat that we have, the gripping photos are placed directly on

3090
04:53:02.558 --> 04:53:08.878
This arrested man and I shake to directly that it is identical upholstery

3091
04:53:08.878 --> 04:53:15.400
eh and body constitution size eh and so on the man we

3092
04:53:15.400 --> 04:53:20.798
have observed eh eh so i my spontaneous feeling was that yes he must have been there

3093
04:53:20.798 --> 04:53:25.798
To raise simply that was how we judged you saw when there was any picture

3094
04:53:25.798 --> 04:53:31.520
on the bike also yes exactly and the same with the bike was a dark d bike I want to

3095
04:53:31.520 --> 04:53:35.760
Remember that was well in line with the one we had seen okay yes but great

3096
04:53:35.760 --> 04:53:44.160
Eh that was probably what I had in that part it was good eh since then should only

3097
04:53:44.160 --> 04:53:49.760
change pm here eh so have you been involved as I

3098
04:53:49.760 --> 04:53:55.718
understood it in the arrest of Ham's al side out in Bengtsfors that is true

3099
04:53:55.718 --> 04:54:00.320
is right eh then i would like to know a little neighbor how the inland is included and

3100
04:54:00.320 --> 04:54:06.120
What I am particularly interested in is like how mobile phone is handled etc. EH

3101
04:54:06.120 --> 04:54:14.160
We get assignments there that Hamsa should be arrested EH as suspected in this case eh

3102
04:54:14.160 --> 04:54:19.558
I probably didn't know exactly participation there and then and eh in these cases get

3103
04:54:19.558 --> 04:54:23.558
We often to it is very important with the information found

3104
04:54:23.558 --> 04:54:28.040
in the phone they use encrypted chats so that it is usually eh

3105
04:54:28.040 --> 04:54:33.040
aggravating to eh take us into the encrypted chats and one one

3106
04:54:33.040 --> 04:54:38.440
success factor in the fact that the phone is unlocked mm eh at the arrest so we got

3107
04:54:38.440 --> 04:54:43.600
that directive if he can be arrested with an open phone then it is good

3108
04:54:43.600 --> 04:54:51.920
EH Hamsa leaves his home address current day along with a

3109
04:54:51.920 --> 04:54:58.520
as we judged friend or a man and they start jogging down toward a bus stop in

3110
04:54:58.520 --> 04:55:04.878
Close connection to the home address eh my two colleagues

3111
04:55:04.878 --> 04:55:10.958
eh stops eh hamsa eh identifies as a police officer

3112
04:55:10.958 --> 04:55:14.718
and eh in conjunction with that I see that he

3113
04:55:14.718 --> 04:55:18.760
holding the phone in hand so I take it away from him because there is a decision about

3114
04:55:18.760 --> 04:55:25.200
that it should seize mm Eh so I take the phone sand with it identifying

3115
04:55:25.200 --> 04:55:32.280
themselves as police officers and eh we keep him eh it will be very like a multi -art

3116
04:55:32.280 --> 04:55:38.040
As soon as we take the phone and they grab him so he sits to

3117
04:55:38.040 --> 04:55:43.920
Physically counter -defense simply eh I exhibit the phone I see that

3118
04:55:43.920 --> 04:55:50.680
It is Face ID thus one it is unlocked with with face recognition

3119
04:55:50.680 --> 04:55:54.760
eh so i show off the phone to him and ask if it is his phone he

3120
04:55:54.760 --> 04:55:58.680
says yes it is my phone and then he immediately realizes that the phone is holding

3121
04:55:58.680 --> 04:56:03.360
on and unlocked which makes him close and grimace the face and

3122
04:56:03.360 --> 04:56:09.240
turning down the head and pushing down the face into its hood or its hood jacket

3123
04:56:09.240 --> 04:56:14.440
eh eh it was very very clear that he realized that he himself was that

3124
04:56:14.440 --> 04:56:19.680
unlock the phone with the recognition of the face etc. eh and then he does everything in

3125
04:56:19.680 --> 04:56:26.638
its power to eh eh not we should be able to unlock it with with that method etc. so

3126
04:56:26.638 --> 04:56:30.520
It was clear that it was sensitive

3127
04:56:30.520 --> 04:56:35.638
eh starts screaming clove words and we will never get into that one

3128
04:56:35.638 --> 04:56:39.400
the phone and and so there he says the end that it's not even my phone

3129
04:56:39.400 --> 04:56:46.798
And so there even though he initially said he yes to mm just

3130
04:56:47.920 --> 04:56:53.200
It is just that yes no but that's what I wanted answers to anyway thanks

3131
04:56:53.200 --> 04:56:56.120
Thank you so much then I will go to the opportunity here here please no thanks I have

3132
04:56:56.120 --> 04:57:02.760
no questions lawyer larsson no thanks lawyer eh eaten i can set someone

3133
04:57:02.760 --> 04:57:08.240
Ask Hi Hi Eh Don't know if you also work as an investigator holding police interrogation

3134
04:57:08.240 --> 04:57:14.320
and so there too okay but what is your view then eh people who are arrested

3135
04:57:14.320 --> 04:57:20.600
In general, they usually want the police to check through the phone or

3136
04:57:20.600 --> 04:57:26.920
Eh between us absolutely would you agree that most of most people did not want to

3137
04:57:26.920 --> 04:57:31.080
That they look at the phone most often so it can usually be a discussion

3138
04:57:31.080 --> 04:57:33.320
Why do you want to get into my phone and

3139
04:57:33.320 --> 04:57:39.440
eh no i have sensitive pictures there or yes here it was on in a second decision

3140
04:57:39.440 --> 04:57:45.040
so it really was struggle for life not to unlock the phone m it I

3141
04:57:45.040 --> 04:57:49.080
understands is that he he really just closed because then you can't access

3142
04:57:49.080 --> 04:57:53.120
Face recognition yes close your eyes and pushes the face into

3143
04:57:53.120 --> 04:57:58.638
his own jacket and then pushes his head toward their own knees before he

3144
04:57:58.638 --> 04:58:05.558
sitting in bus place just that okay no no more superficial thanks mm nice booklund no

3148
04:58:24.600 --> 04:58:30.240

3149
04:58:30.240 --> 04:58:33.718
take that one could have a credit card or something that thought before that

3150
