37
00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:38.840
Bobs and the cops that they call and that f will do inta and then in the end we

38
00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:42.239

previously never seen the person in the area that I did not recognize eh so

45
00:04:27.199 --> 00:04:30.759
I noticed that there is a person outside my home back and forth and

46
00:04:30.759 --> 00:04:37.840
stand and try to get into the gate as it was loose down there mm eh when I

47
00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:42.600

48
00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:47.840

49
00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:54.720

69
00:06:46.080 --> 00:06:51.800
that this is actually that is true this is something serious that will happen etc.

70
00:06:51.800 --> 00:06:57.919
Eh i first since it was so this guy that you described

76
00:07:25.800 --> 00:07:32.160
The gate up it was hard to see it was not really so bright but I noticed

77
00:07:32.160 --> 00:07:37.599
that this person was not I do not know we have never seen him

78
00:07:37.599 --> 00:07:43.000
earlier in the area we usually know each other the neighbors and the other area we

79
00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:47.680
see each other during the days but it was very unusual to me and plus I

80
00:07:47.680 --> 00:07:53.479
connected a bit with Bobs when they were on me all day during the day that it will happen

81
00:07:53.479 --> 00:07:58.240
something and there is threat picture and so directly i connected everything yes eh it

82
00:07:58.240 --> 00:08:03.680
the evening and so it was just that eh but did you someone else

83
00:08:03.680 --> 00:08:07.960
observance of this guy yes except it was a guy that he was dark

84
00:08:07.960 --> 00:08:13.280
dressed then how do you mean yes but if you were older or younger or were no it was

85
00:08:13.280 --> 00:08:19.199
pretty young guy so it was a young guy it was

86
00:08:19.280 --> 00:08:26.560
not mm around 2022 years the age can see yes

87
00:08:26.560 --> 00:08:30.840
Mm is reaching the tag that has hair color for or something

88
00:08:30.840 --> 00:08:38.000
like that he had such a short brief quite as cutting you frs it wasn't far was

89
00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:45.040
that something was pretty k as yes but just yes he had someone

90
00:08:45.040 --> 00:08:51.640
Beard or something like that I didn't really see the whole and when he got up on the stairs

91
00:08:51.640 --> 00:08:57.519
I had the phone I saw a bit through the holes but I I can't directly take

92
00:08:57.519 --> 00:09:03.120
forward him faces because it was very stressful while I had

93
00:09:03.120 --> 00:09:09.120
panic I phone was waiting for the police so I lost a lot but I will

94
00:09:09.120 --> 00:09:13.720
Remember when I bleed a little this with clothes and stuff I couldn't have directly

95
00:09:13.720 --> 00:09:19.920
be focusing early on that person no but then when i back it was already gone

96
00:09:19.920 --> 00:09:25.120
Yeah just ehm mound color then someone has mine of it

97
00:09:25.120 --> 00:09:30.120
black so it was a dark dark guy it was

98
00:09:30.120 --> 00:09:36.440
Mork but it was yes but is this something you see about the peephole in

99
00:09:36.440 --> 00:09:42.040
the outer door or see d n toward the gate gate since I came in I shouted they

100
00:09:42.040 --> 00:09:47.920
didn't he answer with my neighbor they just comit in mm so i closed quickly d

101
00:09:47.920 --> 00:09:52.480
the balcony and then back then he has been up already at the stairs exactly

102
00:09:52.480 --> 00:10:00.320
outside my door etc. where I saw a bit as I say but I did not have directly

103
00:10:00.320 --> 00:10:06.920
Focus No Prime Crime DSE But you do something special when is up there outside

104
00:10:06.920 --> 00:10:12.800
The door then you notice you do something special when up there no had the phone in hand

105
00:10:12.800 --> 00:10:19.079
I checked in the trunk a bit at him he had the cellphone in his hand but he used to take

106
00:10:19.079 --> 00:10:23.480
away the cellphone as soon as someone comes when he brings out his cellphone so it was not

107
00:10:23.480 --> 00:10:28.480
something special he g only he had the cellphone in his hand much more and then yes

108
00:10:28.480 --> 00:10:35.440
But a little clear control of the pages since you come in and so there etc. How do you mean

109
00:10:35.440 --> 00:10:40.120
that he you said he takes up the cellphone when reaching came when reaching came when reaching then comes then

110
00:10:40.120 --> 00:10:43.760
he takes his cellphone so fast when it is gone when he puts back in his

111
00:10:43.760 --> 00:10:52.240
Pocket so kind of yes and when I get extra concern when I saw this too

112
00:10:52.240 --> 00:10:58.240
clearly yes just that but I had while waiting for the police too they respond and

113
00:10:58.240 --> 00:11:03.959
will come and a little check and check here in the area eh that they have signed under

114
00:11:03.959 --> 00:11:09.200
day that there is foot image and and that person was very much for me new person

115
00:11:09.200 --> 00:11:15.399
new eh there was no one you recognized no no no no such young guy we have

116
00:11:15.399 --> 00:11:20.560
not in the area even if there are you all have their key on the gate they go in

117
00:11:20.560 --> 00:11:27.279
with so it is no one will stand outside the gates and in that way but it it

118
00:11:27.279 --> 00:11:31.880
the gate is locked otherwise on is after nine o'clock it is resolved and it was after all

119
00:11:31.880 --> 00:11:38.240
After nine they were he was in place yes what do you remember what time can be out of

120
00:11:38.240 --> 00:11:43.760
that it was after nine oh I don't actually know exactly but it could be around ten

121
00:11:43.760 --> 00:11:47.880
So the time I don't really know but I know it was after nine gates

122
00:11:47.880 --> 00:11:54.560
Be loose etc. Yes but I understand it can be around 11 you 10 11

n you shouts none of them not he not my neighbor no ok okay it there

125

133
00:12:43.639 --> 00:12:49.839
drop off and take and calm and sleep I have made the whole dark home and then have

134
00:12:49.839 --> 00:12:55.040

135
00:12:55.040 --> 00:13:00.480
So down the resort then immediately I wake up and check if there is something that happens

136

177
00:16:40.360 --> 00:16:46.720
More questions etc. then we'll see about Mås Questions Yes Thanks Hello like this I also have some

178
00:16:46.720 --> 00:16:51.560
questions eh you told us here initially that you had been in

179
00:16:51.560 --> 00:16:55.880
contact with the police several times during this day and got it that

180
00:16:55.880 --> 00:17:01.639
was there a threat to the family thought F How long before this event

181
00:17:01.639 --> 00:17:04.799
Have you been in contact with the police or with

182
00:17:04.799 --> 00:17:10.839
Bobs the day before they were at home too

183
00:17:10.839 --> 00:17:17.959
eh they told me a little briefly that there is threat picture eh but they were not entirely sure

184
00:17:17.959 --> 00:17:25.880
they didn't know but they just wanted me to inform us it could happen but they have

185
00:17:25.880 --> 00:17:30.960
not invited that we should leave the apartment etc. they have not offer it yet

186
00:17:30.960 --> 00:17:37.880
But they informed us that there is so for me it was very difficult and and take it

187
00:17:37.880 --> 00:17:43.000
here accept that because there were very much questions about why I have

188
00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:49.400
no problems with any eh why v should have there are such threats run my kids etc.

189
00:17:49.400 --> 00:17:53.919
I work my kids have school and job so there is no thing I couldn't

190
00:17:53.919 --> 00:17:59.000
Purpose immediately it f was very difficult so so at this time when you

191
00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:04.480
got information about the threat picture it was new information for you then eh that day eh d

192
00:18:04.480 --> 00:18:10.440
Inan yes when the cops were at home etc. and then you tell you about this

193
00:18:10.440 --> 00:18:15.720
observation you made this man who moved the staircase

194
00:18:15.720 --> 00:18:21.919
ehm as you described I think what did you do any connection from it

195
00:18:21.919 --> 00:18:29.159
The police had said that what you saw there what do you mean you tell you

196
00:18:29.159 --> 00:18:33.919
you say when you wake up then there will be chaos etc. but think before that do you

197
00:18:33.919 --> 00:18:38.720
any connection with between what the police have said about the threat picture man moving

198
00:18:38.720 --> 00:18:43.720
staircase yes yes but of course directly this day when they called me bobs

199
00:18:43.720 --> 00:18:51.400
called me eh when worry about me gets bigger mm when I thought yes but then must

200
00:18:51.400 --> 00:18:56.440
So I think through and believe it there must be something otherwise

201
00:18:56.440 --> 00:19:02.120
the police without grove not button on my door if there is no other seriousness

202
00:19:02.120 --> 00:19:06.880
Mm so what I thought very much after there but I couldn't take out what is

203
00:19:06.880 --> 00:19:13.240
it like hb and why mm so it makes me very difficult mm to accept this

204
00:19:13.240 --> 00:19:17.640
Mm you've been on you a little bit but I was going to ask you if you could develop

205
00:19:17.640 --> 00:19:22.760
Can you describe to us how did you experience this event what what like

206
00:19:22.760 --> 00:19:27.159
aroused it for feelings in you it is a lot that is very much indeed and

207
00:19:27.159 --> 00:19:31.120
I think if we first focus on below

208
00:19:31.120 --> 00:19:35.880
The evening can you describe to us how you felt

209
00:19:35.880 --> 00:19:42.880
Then it was a very difficult situation really as I cannot describe is

210
00:19:42.880 --> 00:19:51.840
very messy and scary can s I can sit in dark for two weeks thus

211
00:19:51.840 --> 00:19:59.960
wave and just think and so fast when reaching the fbi the man I become extra worry what is

212
00:19:59.960 --> 00:20:04.559
as happens it may come to happen because I don't know who is trying to burn

213
00:20:04.559 --> 00:20:10.840
m m my child it is very difficult situation it was for me

214
00:20:11.480 --> 00:20:18.240
really so both in the meantime but even afterwards it is so you should understand that you

215
00:20:18.240 --> 00:20:24.400
know this turmoil very much so I've lost everything mm eh I force

216
00:20:24.400 --> 00:20:30.640
also actually in contact doctor because of it mm so it was not good

217
00:20:30.640 --> 00:20:36.000
Time for me you can describe for how long this turmoil has been sitting in

218
00:20:36.000 --> 00:20:40.760
and how has the period after been for you it was very difficult especially they

219
00:20:40.760 --> 00:20:46.480
where the first two weeks eh that i could not work i could not do anything

220
00:20:46.480 --> 00:20:51.679
because they are just in control and account and it is together the cops v so fast

221
00:20:51.679 --> 00:20:56.760
my thing happened immediately i called them and contacted them so it was me for

222
00:20:56.760 --> 00:21:01.760
me it was not ordinary life etc. I did not have normal life until the police

223
00:21:01.760 --> 00:21:07.440
called and that I can go back to my job and then careful start slowly

224
00:21:07.440 --> 00:21:14.559
I force Leave home too two weeks so we should not at home etc. eh

225
00:21:14.559 --> 00:21:20.960
During the days two weeks from this event when yes etc. have you been allowed to change

226
00:21:20.960 --> 00:21:24.919
your routines or yes but that is obviously man

227
00:21:24.919 --> 00:21:29.919
Becomes otherwise, etc. It becomes obvious you lose routines you

228
00:21:29.919 --> 00:21:33.840
loses that you should thus get me because it is difficult to eat too

229
00:21:33.840 --> 00:21:40.720
I had huge stress anxiety eh so while I forcibly contact

230
00:21:40.720 --> 00:21:47.000
the doctor who received medicine can release calmly down me and try and

231
00:21:47.000 --> 00:21:53.760
Sleep etc. No it was very really the situation very difficult for us etc. and

232
00:21:53.760 --> 00:21:58.880
Do you have how have you done some G Tagels about how your children have reacted to here

233
00:21:58.880 --> 00:22:04.320
Yes they also affect mm in what way has it noticed on them the same as me they

234
00:22:04.320 --> 00:22:10.679
was also concern even if they did not want to show clearly but I felt them their

235
00:22:10.679 --> 00:22:18.080
worry also the same thing as m they had mm eh they were at work in the days late

236
00:22:18.080 --> 00:22:25.000
evenings late we used to come home really late when everything gets dark and calm

237
00:22:25.000 --> 00:22:29.559
Then you think you are like their mother in what way do you notice on them that they

238
00:22:29.559 --> 00:22:36.880
Also are worried about food I thought noticed a lot the lost food that they should

239
00:22:36.880 --> 00:22:44.640
hard to eat ehm so it was just like me and how

240
00:22:44.640 --> 00:22:49.400
How will your children become when they get worried they will be open up and talk

241
00:22:49.400 --> 00:22:56.440
Or do they get closed no no no how how it was much more quiet and

242
00:22:56.440 --> 00:23:05.480
think and as i all said to lose this with patit with not eating food

243
00:23:06.400 --> 00:23:11.240
mm mm you were awake too I usually I noticed on them that they were after all

244
00:23:11.240 --> 00:23:18.760
awake at night but was it silent more in the room bed mm it is hard to sleep

245
00:23:18.760 --> 00:23:22.120
just like me, so I was actually affected the whole

246
00:23:22.120 --> 00:23:25.080
[Music] Family

247
00:23:25.080 --> 00:23:30.400
Mm Thanks then I do not have any more questions for you etc. then we will see if

248
00:23:30.400 --> 00:23:33.360

249
00:23:33.360 --> 00:23:38.679
sitting here lawyer larsson no thanks no questions lawyer that no questions thanked

250
00:23:38.679 --> 00:23:47.440
Boklund yes I had a question here only about the threat to your son m

251
00:23:47.440 --> 00:23:53.840
The threat to your son etc. What do you know more about it or what did the police told you about

252
00:23:53.840 --> 00:24:01.279
that no but that i didn't really get direct information was the threat picture to me

253
00:24:01.279 --> 00:24:07.919
or against my son etc. but only they said there is a threat picture we have to protect you

254
00:24:07.919 --> 00:24:15.120
Mm I did not know more than that yes because you have when you are heard by the police so you have

255
00:24:15.120 --> 00:24:20.480
told a little neighbor about his dry accommodation that there would arise any threat picture on

256
00:24:20.480 --> 00:24:27.360
against him what eh you were told by the police to on the son's

257
00:24:27.360 --> 00:24:32.840
former accommodation etc so he would have been offered and do something and first

258
00:24:32.840 --> 00:24:39.000
I thanked me and then thanked no etc. it is true you remember it yes but

259
00:24:39.000 --> 00:24:44.559
It is the police they have such information yes and do you know what it was to

260
00:24:44.559 --> 00:24:51.159
do something no yes yes here they have written then on page 11 in insurance

261
00:24:51.159 --> 00:24:56.640
the protocol that he would go and hurt someone in Stockholm etc. and so he had

262
00:24:56.640 --> 00:25:02.919
First said yes but then changed and said no and then it became a threat to him

263
00:25:02.919 --> 00:25:07.399
I don't know the police know yes that was the police told me like me I know

264
00:25:07.399 --> 00:25:12.760
not really the whole story etc. they don't tell you

265
00:25:13.360 --> 00:25:18.000
much yes they told us right about stock but what I know I am very grateful

266
00:25:18.000 --> 00:25:23.600
that my son has thanked me for it did not go on with it a child m

267
00:25:23.600 --> 00:25:29.080
m Then I have no more questions m lawyer Olof no

268
00:25:29.080 --> 00:25:34.000

the recording and then recording was up and then it is the plaintiff's interrogation here with

390
00:37:11.560 --> 00:37:16.119
Allan Rashid and then Allan will go so that the prosecutor is the one who has

391

00:40:30.319 --> 00:40:35.760
murderer it was and the other is that I was not going to answer one question from

426
00:40:35.760 --> 00:40:41.800
Prosecutor I have not been treated fairly because you have to think I woke up

432
00:41:09.280 --> 00:41:14.160
right o and be completely silent but the prosecutor also has the right to ask questions so

433
00:41:14.160 --> 00:41:17.880

434
00:41:17.880 --> 00:41:23.079

Hi I will ask quite a few questions anyway Leon Eh but before I

436
00:41:28.400 --> 00:41:32.319
Starting with this so I just ask you to consider one thing I have all respect

437
00:41:32.319 --> 00:41:35.839
because you don't want to say anything it is like as you h chair totally okay

438
00:41:35.839 --> 00:41:40.520
but now keep in mind that you risk a very long prison sentence in the end of

439
00:41:40.520 --> 00:41:43.480
this negotiation so you have that mind so you don't miss that bit when

440
00:41:43.480 --> 00:41:50.680
you when choosing your strategy that hearing then first start with we have

441
00:41:50.680 --> 00:41:57.839
looked at phone numbers ending at 5140 that has to a phone that took in

442
00:41:57.839 --> 00:42:01.000
seizure from you this is your

443
00:42:01.440 --> 00:42:08.359
phone since then we have looked at a signal Alas San called S78 is that

444
00:42:08.359 --> 00:42:13.920
Your signal Aljas has looked at a signal that

445
00:42:13.920 --> 00:42:19.800

447
00:42:24.319 --> 00:42:27.319
him

448
00:42:28.440 --> 00:42:34.480

00:55:41.760 --> 00:55:46.160
Can you tell me a little bit what was it what was you talking about then

587
00:55:46.160 --> 00:55:51.000
So the police what I do not remember it was giant length

588
00:55:51.000 --> 00:55:58.079
Mm I say you have talked a little bit about Leon's belongings yes what what

589
00:55:58.079 --> 00:56:02.680
Do you know you know anything about the n öck sofa choice yes it was like this

590
00:56:02.680 --> 00:56:07.079
that eh the same night as Leon went or the same

591
00:56:07.079 --> 00:56:15.640
day eh so i was there with eh two other eh and eh we took drugs then when i

592
00:56:15.640 --> 00:56:21.359
woke up so he was scream away then i'd go out and face them

593
00:56:21.359 --> 00:56:26.400
eh and since i took back that way i could take back

594
00:56:26.400 --> 00:56:33.440
then so when i'm maybe 10 meters from the gate eh they shout and serger that it

595
00:56:33.440 --> 00:56:38.240
standing TV outside his door too and then I thought to go back and leave

596
00:56:38.240 --> 00:56:43.400
it and then when i open the door eh so the police

597
00:56:47.720 --> 00:56:54.319
there so it wasn't v so this you have you have gathered some stuff for leon

598
00:56:54.319 --> 00:56:59.720
No have not collected no you have acted so that so no one so that if

599
00:56:59.720 --> 00:57:04.520
one would get stuck in some way that they no did not get away no lean has not said

600
00:57:04.520 --> 00:57:09.799
to me to gather stuff no no no it is you sure yes i have said

601
00:57:09.799 --> 00:57:16.359
that because eh I don't want what is the name of the other guys names no

602
00:57:16.359 --> 00:57:21.400
then there when the police arrived I was stressed etc. but I we agreed that you

603
00:57:21.400 --> 00:57:27.720
have said in police interviews that you are because you sam together Leon's stuff yes

604
00:57:27.720 --> 00:57:32.280
But I have said yes okay and what was it you said what was the reason you

605
00:57:32.280 --> 00:57:37.280
Collect up Leon's stuff then as you said I said he told me

606
00:57:37.280 --> 00:57:43.200
to make it yes but that is not right no exactly and where and what what do you say

607
00:57:43.200 --> 00:57:45.720
lasting reason he has said it was then something special that would

608
00:57:45.720 --> 00:57:50.160
So nothing special so that

609
00:57:50.160 --> 00:57:55.520
is not really right it was just something I said etc. I say that

610
00:57:55.520 --> 00:57:59.799
you had told the police then that it would gather Leon's stuff in case he

611
00:57:59.799 --> 00:58:04.359
would get stuck so that the police or SOS or anyone else would come

612
00:58:04.359 --> 00:58:12.720
ate the stuff yes exactly eh jaus it was yes okay i also say that you have

613
00:58:12.720 --> 00:58:16.559
helped Leon then by doing in the way it has been a support for him one

614
00:58:16.559 --> 00:58:21.359
security for him by looking at his stuff but then you now mean to

615
00:58:21.359 --> 00:58:27.880
Skill against the police that it is not true yes no that is not right no no okay

616
00:58:27.880 --> 00:58:34.000
Okay one eye just gonna make a listing here

617
00:58:46.200 --> 00:58:52.799
Eh mm there is, among other things, on page 403 when I just double check this now then

618
00:58:52.799 --> 00:58:57.319
that it's no more crazy Leon has said that if I don't

619
00:58:57.319 --> 00:59:01.440
coming back so I would take care of his things he said before he went

620
00:59:01.440 --> 00:59:05.440
And that was not true then no it is not true but that was what I said

621
00:59:05.440 --> 00:59:13.480
Yes but just exactly that you

622
00:59:19.280 --> 00:59:23.559
eh did you know anything about who this client was or who it was

623
00:59:23.559 --> 00:59:29.039
that had, as Leon had been in contact with to step then no no had you

624
00:59:29.039 --> 00:59:33.200
any nickname or something no so i can't say i know

625
00:59:33.200 --> 00:59:37.799
So it eh what he tells me and then what I have seen in his phone

626
00:59:37.799 --> 00:59:44.640
it is but i don't know who mm because there is also where i need

627
00:59:44.640 --> 00:59:49.359
probably just look a little neighbor at this it is like

Okay, I understand

657
01:03:00.079 --> 01:03:03.960
Then there is and this is the summary hearing so it can be

658
01:03:03.960 --> 01:03:07.440
a little performer but there is at 46 just well double check now because you say you

659
01:03:07.440 --> 01:03:11.440
does not remember who it is that has done what has offered L about this that you do not

660
01:03:11.440 --> 01:03:17.720
knew this then then you got the question at 406 after you denied crime then a

661
01:03:17.720 --> 01:03:23.599
suspected interrogation tell me all about this event Örebro so talked about that

662
01:03:23.599 --> 01:03:27.720
Leon then it stands like this v feel hike

663
01:03:27.720 --> 01:03:31.160
Three months ago it was he who offers me to follow this on

664
01:03:31.160 --> 01:03:37.400
The thing is that Leon Rustic offers you to offer you to come along and step

665
01:03:37.400 --> 01:03:44.400
Eh what v did you say eh tuning that leon rustic offers you to follow along and step

666
01:03:44.400 --> 01:03:47.760
So I can't say that he's told me I have only seen

667
01:03:47.760 --> 01:03:54.839
Messages etc. where they said to pick up as many you can it had you seen yes it is

668
01:03:54.839 --> 01:03:58.760
What I have seen but not that he has told me that I will follow with no

669
01:03:58.760 --> 01:04:03.920
NO NO NO NO OK EH I said no Actually he goes it later

670
01:04:03.920 --> 01:04:08.680
Yes it is true or mm then i didn't know either if it was

671
01:04:08.680 --> 01:04:13.920
northbö yes i didn't know no just like that but then then it came so

672
01:04:13.920 --> 01:04:20.200
It was another guy hambo who offered this job to Leon yes it could be

673
01:04:20.200 --> 01:04:26.599
so yeah but i don't remember no there were people over h who are his reball he on this

674
01:04:26.599 --> 01:04:35.079
The job yes I don't know no no just that but that it may be like that

675
01:04:35.079 --> 01:04:41.160
Yes exactly

676
01:04:44.000 --> 01:04:50.160
Mm and what was it that did you not know anything what

677
01:04:50.160 --> 01:04:56.039
would be done what what Leon would do now as he sat on the train no

678
01:04:56.039 --> 01:05:01.760
I didn't know anything so I said that I didn't want to keep up with no

679
01:05:01.760 --> 01:05:08.200
then yes no because there is a little more precise

680
01:05:08.200 --> 01:05:11.920
information here as as what it should be about as well as that D as I am changed

681
01:05:11.920 --> 01:05:18.520
a little neighbor but still got some information 411 because with you it is also

682
01:05:18.520 --> 01:05:23.880
reaching summary for know man they are a little easier to read about it

683
01:05:23.880 --> 01:05:28.839
Not getting eh's quarrels about words and

684
01:05:28.839 --> 01:05:35.520
between you can say this ehm how how come you don't

685
01:05:35.520 --> 01:05:41.200
that you did not keep up with this yes I said I regretted I did not want to

686
01:05:41.200 --> 01:05:45.839
make it no no but i understand it did you say but why don't you want to do it

687
01:05:45.839 --> 01:05:52.240
because I had been sitting on sis eh and i came out and i got apartment so i

688
01:05:52.240 --> 01:05:58.760
wanted to take the chance to take care of me etc. and just that just

689
01:05:59.359 --> 01:06:05.400
that's exactly because it also says on 411 here that in exactly the same way so that it

690
01:06:05.400 --> 01:06:11.760
that is nothing strange but that but so have you told you what

691
01:06:11.760 --> 01:06:19.799
it was as it was about here and you remembered did not say you were no but because then stands

692
01:06:19.799 --> 01:06:24.520
that is like this now that Alfon tells us that it was a guy named Hamko who offered

693
01:06:24.520 --> 01:06:32.559
rusti 200 thousands to blast a gate there is something you feel

694
01:06:32.559 --> 01:06:38.000
again thus that with blasting gate it is

695
01:06:38.000 --> 01:06:42.279
Just what Leon has believed that he is going to do etc. But no one has said he to say

696
01:06:42.279 --> 01:06:48.180
he'll do it no okay it was speculation

697
01:06:48.180 --> 01:06:53.960
[Music] mm just that

698
01:06:57.119 --> 01:07:05.240
Just that and what was it for who was on the top the donor then so who was

699
01:07:05.240 --> 01:07:10.480
What I do not know no because it appears here as well in the same paragraph then it

700
01:07:10.480 --> 01:07:15.400
As the police recorded here when Alfon thought that

701
01:07:15.400 --> 01:07:23.559
yes now so like this ehm rob has told me that it would step to the fox that it was

702
01:07:23.559 --> 01:07:30.440
A job for the fox against the strawberry yes how is that thing or

703
01:07:30.440 --> 01:07:34.039
Really or incorrectly just that day he does not tell you when he

704
01:07:34.039 --> 01:07:39.400
went he has told me that maybe a few days before but just that

705
01:07:39.400 --> 01:07:45.119
the day when he went he said nothing mm no ok okay he said it later

706
01:07:45.119 --> 01:07:49.880
Days type in the evening the night before he went hbo no

707
01:07:49.880 --> 01:07:55.680
the evening the same day yes yes okay so when he was in Öbro yeah okay he has

708
01:07:55.680 --> 01:08:01.119
not said anything when he was on the train or on his way no but you were perceived

709
01:08:01.119 --> 01:08:04.880
So did you realize that he would step when put on the train no not when he put

710
01:08:04.880 --> 01:08:08.640
themselves on the train I knew nothing I knew nothing and I didn't think so

711
01:08:08.640 --> 01:08:14.480
a lot on it mm just that yes but i

712
01:08:14.480 --> 01:08:18.239
Understand yes

713
01:08:22.480 --> 01:08:30.359
understand this now eh we talked about

714
01:08:30.359 --> 01:08:37.880
Hanko have you had any contact with the Hanko himself yes a little

715
01:08:37.880 --> 01:08:44.520
ehm we talk about for or after the event or both and thus may have

716
01:08:44.520 --> 01:08:52.480
been eh the year before eh and then maybe a little but we have not written with

717
01:08:52.480 --> 01:09:00.120

718
01:09:00.120 --> 01:09:06.880

no have you been in touch with N HK and something after

723
01:09:29.080 --> 01:09:36.440
The proportion thus we did not write him after the testimony hearing

724
01:09:36.440 --> 01:09:41.960
Mm eh when i said i had the testimony it was kind of it mm late

725
01:09:41.960 --> 01:09:45.199
have we not written anything so with each other we have sent pictures only

726
01:09:45.199 --> 01:09:51.359
So Snap Pictures Okay We haven't written anything with each other no okay

727
01:09:51.359 --> 01:09:56.239
So that after the event itself, the witness came the hay so it is there apartment

728
01:09:56.239 --> 01:10:01.000
Leon's apartment of that is what I tell you about yes and then you have had

729
01:10:01.000 --> 01:10:06.560
Contact Prim Crime DSE Yes or so I wrote to him that I had VN

730
01:10:06.560 --> 01:10:11.880
interrogation yes yes that is the one where we have written with each other about mm and what

731
01:10:11.880 --> 01:10:14.360
is this discussion about then

732
01:10:14.360 --> 01:10:19.360
or i just said i had witness for hears yes what did hamk say something about it

733
01:10:19.360 --> 01:10:25.600
Then that I don't remember no okay

734
01:10:25.600 --> 01:10:30.320
How did this conversations feel it okay yes so I will

735
01:10:30.320 --> 01:10:36.400
not remember it was a long time see yes you have somehow been threatened or

736
01:10:36.400 --> 01:10:47.080
anything by someone no no no you are sure yes mm

737
01:10:48.280 --> 01:10:54.320
okay eh and hemp then he says something or does he do something about as if

738
01:10:54.320 --> 01:11:00.560
about Leon Rustic then what this conversation now as you have you and

739
01:11:00.560 --> 01:11:05.320
Hanko is in any way about Leon Rustic also V he made or not

740
01:11:05.320 --> 01:11:09.640
done no I don't think it no it was just that I told you about

741
01:11:09.640 --> 01:11:15.480
The witness hearing etc. It is only that you tell about the witness's company yes yes

742
01:11:15.480 --> 01:11:19.679
Okay yes but

743
01:11:20.560 --> 01:11:24.560
Just mm

744
01:11:26.280 --> 01:11:28.679
just

745
01:11:30.560 --> 01:11:38.760
that yes you got no information at all from hamk what would have happened then no

746
01:11:38.760 --> 01:11:45.960
no did you know what had happened to Leon in this mode when you n when you

747
01:11:45.960 --> 01:11:50.040
have for with the police in the apartment you know you know that it is actually

748
01:11:50.040 --> 01:11:57.800
Gripen then yes so I look at the news etc. eh yes just that so that's just the way I

749
01:11:57.800 --> 01:12:03.639
got r yes okay just

750
01:12:07.440 --> 01:12:12.960
This is because it would have been contact with Hamko after the witness hearing

751
01:12:12.960 --> 01:12:18.199
It is something that has also talked about in interrogation then

752
01:12:18.199 --> 01:12:23.840
ehm There is a task there that deviates from what you say now about this

753
01:12:23.840 --> 01:12:32.360
the contacts in late 163 eh second question and the third question because then you have

754
01:12:32.360 --> 01:12:37.880
got the question like this then you have to read at the same time a tck

755
01:12:37.880 --> 01:12:44.080
Just should we just bring out page 463 and so the second question yes yes then stands

756
01:12:44.080 --> 01:12:48.480
This is how much have you and Hanko been in contact after the smiling is arrested

757
01:12:48.480 --> 01:12:53.120
And that then follows the police when I wrote to Hanko after I had

758
01:12:53.120 --> 01:12:59.320
Witnesses yes and then I wrote that the police had pictures of him he said that

759
01:12:59.320 --> 01:13:04.400
If someone comes it comes home to me and then he sends a picture at the address

760
01:13:04.400 --> 01:13:11.360
where my dad lives yes is not right it is not true no later

761
01:13:11.360 --> 01:13:17.880
So it appears the next part here then develop that he said you would not say

762
01:13:17.880 --> 01:13:23.840
something he said the guys know where you live and send my dad's old address

763
01:13:23.840 --> 01:13:30.360
And my old address yes it is not right no okay it is not true then is after all

764
01:13:30.360 --> 01:13:34.840
The question is of course how does it come so that it is like this then in the publisher I do not know

765
01:13:34.840 --> 01:13:39.199
No, so that with the guys I know where you live it may have been me

766
01:13:39.199 --> 01:13:45.920
mins that you were affected that day eh when I saw that message that

767
01:13:45.920 --> 01:13:52.679
may have been in that signal chat etc. in the group I have seen that message

768
01:13:52.679 --> 01:13:57.840
but that it was not directed at me yeah but your dad's address then is well

769
01:13:57.840 --> 01:14:01.480
Pretty right from you I think yes but that is not in line with the address

770
01:14:01.480 --> 01:14:08.440
It is not true no it will be like this on when I just said it yes

771
01:14:08.440 --> 01:14:14.760
Okay want to want to put E Hams or No

772
01:14:15.719 --> 01:14:24.159
no want to frsa to go free so that where i don't care it doesn't care no

773
01:14:24.159 --> 01:14:28.639
ok my s no so you want you don't want to put

774
01:14:28.639 --> 01:14:33.480
HSA but still it appears then that he would

775
01:14:33.480 --> 01:14:39.120
have threatened you by sending the address to your dad yes f that the guys know

776
01:14:39.120 --> 01:14:43.600
what you g yes you don't know why you said so

777
01:14:43.600 --> 01:14:47.639
there with the guys knowing where you should be right but I can't say that I

778
01:14:47.639 --> 01:14:53.040
Remember no, no really, so it was a long time since I didn't remember no

779
01:14:53.040 --> 01:14:56.639
But then the question is like this now that it can be true that it actually went on

780
01:14:56.639 --> 01:15:00.520
the way I read that you don't remember today yes I

781
01:15:00.520 --> 01:15:07.719
Don't remember no I remember only in the mean yes yes yes

782
01:15:10.360 --> 01:15:15.679
Okay ok but in and now you get to correct wrong now but it means it can go

783
01:15:15.679 --> 01:15:18.520
to the way I have read but it may also be

784
01:15:18.520 --> 01:15:23.800
Wrong so i'm not remembered no yes

785
01:15:25.239 --> 01:15:27.560
but then

786
01:15:31.199 --> 01:15:39.239
So then port is a little more about what will then shop

787
01:15:39.960 --> 01:15:50.200
If about eh your contacts with with Hamsa or hamk then

788
01:15:50.200 --> 01:15:55.520
[Music] ehm yes I heard it right that so you

789
01:15:55.520 --> 01:15:59.639
had not received any information about the incident from Hamgård no I got

790
01:15:59.639 --> 01:16:03.639
No information no information

791
01:16:06.080 --> 01:16:12.149
No [music]

792
01:16:12.560 --> 01:16:20.159
ehm because then there is a task at 460 here that is about just that type there

793
01:16:20.159 --> 01:16:26.920
There is some other information and then we are 460 then we are at

794
01:16:28.520 --> 01:16:33.960
and [music]

795
01:16:34.159 --> 01:16:42.159
M It is then a little brief this with doing things before what knows about D so

796
01:16:42.159 --> 01:16:48.239
If the question is in the middle, the lawyer now finds yes eh so it is about

797
01:16:48.239 --> 01:16:53.840
that Leon would have received money type 300 kr

798
01:16:53.840 --> 01:16:59.560
similar but then the question comes then was Leon who told you he

799
01:16:59.560 --> 01:17:05.840
received money then the answer is the police recorded no it was hamko hambko said that

800
01:17:05.840 --> 01:17:12.920
Leon took food money and went yes the day after I believed it was mm just that okay

801
01:17:12.920 --> 01:17:19.960
So that is true anyway mm yes but then so

802
01:17:21.000 --> 01:17:26.840
eh then there is another task here on the same Tem as you then said that you

803
01:17:26.840 --> 01:17:31.880
had not received any information from Hamk about what Leon had done for

804
01:17:31.880 --> 01:17:34.880
anything

805
01:17:35.000 --> 01:17:43.600
eh and then it is on p 465 and st for the middle about a conversation

were something those with some gun m that he would get a gun but I don't know

916
01:29:06.199 --> 01:29:12.480
so there no why would he get some gun as it knows it didn't hang together

917
01:29:12.480 --> 01:29:17.360
with the fact that he would step as you had received I do not know but what usually man

918
01:29:17.360 --> 01:29:24.280

01:29:24.280 --> 01:29:29.840
say I know it yes no one has said m that he is going to shoot me no but yes it

920
01:29:29.840 --> 01:29:34.320
was something with him to get a gun etc. yes but I understand and how

921
01:29:34.320 --> 01:29:38.360
will s that then you want it to send a video on this then yes I want to

923
01:29:44.320 --> 01:29:47.639
Mm just

924
01:29:48.560 --> 01:29:54.080
Then we have the event then

925
01:29:54.840 --> 01:29:57.719
this with the fact that there will be problems with the train

926
01:29:57.719 --> 01:30:03.080
Yes where it helped him but then we have time here now it is on p 108 but it has

927
01:30:03.080 --> 01:30:10.080
Go 1446 Prime Crime DS but you but you think

928
01:30:10.080 --> 01:30:14.360
self that you helped Leon in that situation so to come yes exactly I helped he

929
01:30:14.360 --> 01:30:20.159
toe But I didn't know any crime would be committed no no but exactly

930
01:30:20.159 --> 01:30:25.239
Eh it is so that he gets stressed so experience reaching stress yes exactly for him

931
01:30:25.239 --> 01:30:29.760
did not have much battery on their phone how else is it with Leon small

932
01:30:29.760 --> 01:30:36.000
perception is he is easily stressed so he a calm person otherwise he

933
01:30:36.000 --> 01:30:41.400
is a calm or he like keeps everything within him he is not so much outward no

934
01:30:41.400 --> 01:30:47.080
he I experience he as a calm person like that but when things like become becomes

935
01:30:47.080 --> 01:30:51.560
hard time he gets stressed then I feel calm even those situations yes I

936
01:30:51.560 --> 01:30:57.600
Believe calm or stressed I am stressed then

937
01:30:57.600 --> 01:31:00.159
Yes, okay

938
01:31:01.320 --> 01:31:07.760
Yes yes so help him with this then

939
01:31:11.880 --> 01:31:16.679
Eh just like that then it's something we can't see here because you get asked it

940
01:31:16.679 --> 01:31:24.199
is on page 109 from Leon for question 16 2957 what do you do at the police

941
01:31:24.199 --> 01:31:32.440
Yeah what is that something yes i walked by yes yes i would eh go home to

942
01:31:32.440 --> 01:31:37.719
my friend etc. and to get there if you go from eh where Leon lives so you have to go

943
01:31:37.719 --> 01:31:43.440
past the police house, etc. and how did he know about it when he saw me at

944

951
01:32:24.320 --> 01:32:29.199
everything okay but then fte it on the snap map anyway yes so

You mean that you knew to reach where in Örebro so yes I knew he

Was in Örebro but I thought he was going to Stockholm etc. Yes just that

954
01:32:38.880 --> 01:32:42.000
Did you think so even when he sat the car

955
01:32:42.000 --> 01:32:48.400
Yes I didn't know what it was what was for car or who he was with no no

01:35:31.880 --> 01:35:36.960

984
01:35:44.239 --> 01:35:49.440
Mm but you are still friends so you were Leon yes

985
01:35:49.440 --> 01:35:54.440
yes, like his friend could not tell him that it was very bad idea

986
01:35:54.440 --> 01:35:59.400
to do this what you do d you this I said that he is constantly in three

987
01:35:59.400 --> 01:36:05.239
weeks maybe mm yes late when he chose to go then I

988
01:36:05.239 --> 01:36:12.040
couldn't what should I say yes when he was on the way does not

989
01:36:12.040 --> 01:36:18.080
For example, yes but I said it first yes etc. I understand but now now now turns still

990
01:36:18.080 --> 01:36:22.199
Know like that now it is like this, still seriously this now now says in all

991
01:36:22.199 --> 01:36:28.040
fall self to do something yes

992
01:36:34.000 --> 01:36:40.400
No then just after this then he replies to your question film then

993
01:36:40.400 --> 01:36:46.280
Or yes not when I do it so you can do so where I will cod then write

994
01:36:46.280 --> 01:36:54.400
you 248 no brother s leon joha haaha it will see the news has your reply man

995
01:36:54.400 --> 01:36:58.320
and Ma check what a quick on

996
01:37:00.719 --> 01:37:06.080
cod is this something that is part of the lead to try to make Leon not

997
01:37:06.080 --> 01:37:14.719
well that the abomination what do you mean to be when he writes when I will cod yes

998
01:37:14.719 --> 01:37:22.239
and you serve no brother so it sounds from my side like you were trying to get

999
01:37:22.239 --> 01:37:26.800
him to actually implement, the snare brought he should not do it no I

1000
01:37:26.800 --> 01:37:30.840
didn't want him to implement it no yes yes you said and you said that too

1001
01:37:30.840 --> 01:37:35.360
that you sent notification that he would film for makes the reached stressed then that

1002
01:37:35.360 --> 01:37:40.159
he would fine it I buy but just this message it says I will

1003
01:37:40.159 --> 01:37:46.159
cod and you say v no yes but what I mean that if the police then he was

1004
01:37:46.159 --> 01:37:51.199
afraid that the police saw what we wrote etc. what I mean that if they have already seen

1005
01:37:51.199 --> 01:37:55.280
So he has already coded etc. yes but it will come a little later if you say so

1006
01:37:55.280 --> 01:38:00.199
Also, but in order to, like when breathing, cod, no, it means that

1007
01:38:00.199 --> 01:38:04.920
I perceive all cases as you are trying to encourage to continue but so

1008
01:38:04.920 --> 01:38:10.199
I can't say I don't remember no but I don't think I encourage

1009
01:38:10.199 --> 01:38:15.400
no no but it's ok what I'm just trying to understand how you

1010
01:38:15.400 --> 01:38:19.320
thought I won't try to make it all the opinion but only

1011
01:38:19.320 --> 01:38:24.480
But then so but then this continues after the man and checks what snares at

1012
01:38:24.480 --> 01:38:31.159
cod so continue there then page 112 film only i want to see yes it is

1013
01:38:31.159 --> 01:38:36.639
same as sag to yes so I would like to be stressed

1014
01:38:37.599 --> 01:38:44.840
Mm just that you get any answer then from Leon it does not send to the group

1015
01:38:44.840 --> 01:38:50.080
or something it is between you and me what is it for the group he is talking about then

1016
01:38:50.080 --> 01:38:55.440
No I don't remember this is this signal gray dead everyone and yes it can be

1017
01:38:55.440 --> 01:39:00.679
So I don't remember had you access to what is seen there eh I think I

1018
01:39:00.679 --> 01:39:05.679
was with it at the beginning eh but that I left it fairly quickly as

1019
01:39:05.679 --> 01:39:11.760
I said I regretted etc. eh yes don't think I was in the group at all and n

1020
01:39:11.760 --> 01:39:15.719
When time you think you leave this group then then

1021
01:39:15.719 --> 01:39:21.480
Be the sixth in that case yes okay or so I don't remember which day

1022
01:39:21.480 --> 01:39:26.480
But it was the same day that the tickets booked like me

1023
01:39:26.480 --> 01:39:32.040
just left that okay but yes in before this is now we any case then how

1024
01:39:32.040 --> 01:39:36.560
as a one one taken

1025
01:39:36.960 --> 01:39:44.960
Okay just like that then this then continues this conversation 2150 then with

1026
01:39:44.960 --> 01:39:50.080
Questions from you when they are three they are they are two when you are going to step when do you get

1027
01:39:50.080 --> 01:39:53.440
The money yes

1028
01:39:54.639 --> 01:39:59.760
That's when I was in the group Eh a few days before mm yes that was when I

1029
01:39:59.760 --> 01:40:03.400
saw messages that he would receive money

1030
01:40:03.400 --> 01:40:09.760
Prime crime dse but in this situation so know that leam

1031
01:40:09.760 --> 01:40:16.239
is in Öbro anyway what no I think it no okay he had

1032
01:40:16.239 --> 01:40:20.599
not on the snap map I cannot say that if you have gone on or if you

1033
01:40:20.599 --> 01:40:26.639
is left okay but I knew he had gone to Örebro but then I thought that

1034
01:40:26.639 --> 01:40:32.040
he was going to Stockholm etc. Okay not that he would stay no yes just that

1035
01:40:32.040 --> 01:40:40.000
Just that but then eh shall we see where I was

1036
01:40:44.199 --> 01:40:48.440
somewhere when are you going to step when do you get the money

1037
01:40:48.440 --> 01:40:54.400
Yeah i remember being in responding to that

1038
01:40:54.639 --> 01:41:01.080
eh no if they die i get the money yes so have

1039
01:41:01.080 --> 01:41:05.599
you if they can get out it is knit

1040
01:41:05.719 --> 01:41:12.440
Yes what does this mean to you this what what did you think would

1041
01:41:12.440 --> 01:41:16.599
happen so then I know

1042
01:41:18.280 --> 01:41:22.360
Not if they die I get the money means he's going to kill someone maybe it is

1043
01:41:22.360 --> 01:41:26.560
obvious to reach should yes but I don't know was when

1044
01:41:26.560 --> 01:41:34.719
no why no, but that the l who will do it yes the tare he screams it to

1045
01:41:34.719 --> 01:41:40.199
me yes yes but just just

1046
01:41:46.320 --> 01:41:54.920
that yes your answer then yes but hello fog then send themselves to film

1047
01:41:54.920 --> 01:42:02.119
it again then film yes the same cause as before yes

1048
01:42:11.599 --> 01:42:20.159
M Then this appears this I send at 2208 here now since it is at

1049
01:42:20.159 --> 01:42:25.280
73 yes but where are you sent twice what is

1050
01:42:25.280 --> 01:42:31.159
It then yes but what is it then it says how I should film but that's the time

1051
01:42:31.159 --> 01:42:37.320
Two I will do it yes and what is it to do then it is like people

1052
01:42:37.320 --> 01:42:42.800
Will die me now yes exactly yes just

1053
01:42:42.960 --> 01:42:45.960
the

1054
01:42:48.440 --> 01:42:54.000
Okay then it appears that he is himself here too no one is going to

1055
01:42:54.000 --> 01:43:01.679
Eh i i think like this now eh it's hard of course but you feel after all

1056
01:43:01.679 --> 01:43:07.040
Leon etc. he has really good yes he has gone up to higher brother then for

1057
01:43:07.040 --> 01:43:13.760
that as it seems then killing someone or more people

1058
01:43:14.280 --> 01:43:21.920
ehm how do you think he is still affected by the contacts that you have it I

1059
01:43:21.920 --> 01:43:27.719
did not think about at all but cases when he is alone in a city that for F may that he

1060
01:43:27.719 --> 01:43:32.119
lonely he is alone in a city yes that he does not live in.

1061
01:43:32.119 --> 01:43:37.239
crime and so he still has a friend with him on the phone with whom you have contact with

1062
01:43:37.239 --> 01:43:42.560
front and back yes it is a stress factor for hono that

1063
01:43:42.560 --> 01:43:45.840
could be able to abstain from doing this you think or you think that yes

1064
01:43:45.840 --> 01:43:52.080
But it is perhaps a support for her yes I do not know he told me that

1065
01:43:52.080 --> 01:43:58.920
he would go home okay yes when did he say it then i miss not

1066
01:43:58.920 --> 01:44:05.560
i miss i woke up at night he called me yes okay

1067
01:44:05.560 --> 01:44:11.719
okay mm but while as n those with the contacts now still so you don't know about

1068
01:44:11.719 --> 01:44:17.320
man if you were a support for him or no so I I am barely anything

1069
01:44:17.320 --> 01:44:23.400
From that night I was very affected so I can't say no

1070
01:44:23.400 --> 01:44:27.520
If I serve that I remember then I lie etc.

1071
01:44:27.520 --> 01:44:33.119
Absolutely, but if I now claim like this then that if under the circumstances that

1072
01:44:33.119 --> 01:44:38.000
I have told us about now foreign city we have gone very serious crime that one has

1073
01:44:38.000 --> 01:44:44.560
that friend on the phone then contact that does not allocate but more a support

1074
01:44:44.560 --> 01:44:48.360
So there l with a little more of windows but still there is then I would probably

1075
01:44:48.360 --> 01:44:52.199
know the person that it was a support for me you think I deviate from it

1076
01:44:52.199 --> 01:44:57.760
that is normal when I reason like that or do I sound reasonable so I understood

1077
01:44:57.760 --> 01:45:04.800
not the question no I try to think into Leon's situation where yes no thus

1078
01:45:04.800 --> 01:45:09.599
The idea behind why I wrote so it was that he would be stressed and regret

1079
01:45:09.599 --> 01:45:14.040
Yes it wasn't that I would help him okay because you may know that I sew

1080
01:45:14.040 --> 01:45:17.920
To the applicant is tuned that they with the contact are a support for Leon Yes I know I know

1081
01:45:17.920 --> 01:45:23.840
Mm okay but that wasn't the idea behind no

1082
01:45:25.440 --> 01:45:31.280
then there is a little more they come brother they will harass you angry anyway on

1083
01:45:31.280 --> 01:45:38.880
the end of page 113 2210 What v What does hazel mean in the context

1084
01:45:38.880 --> 01:45:44.679
deceive yes yes is the money we are talking about then or something else

1085
01:45:44.679 --> 01:45:50.000
Yeah i think that i don't remember

1086
01:45:50.760 --> 01:45:54.840
No I understand

1087
01:45:55.920 --> 01:46:00.960
Then there are some questions since 114 here middle

1088
01:46:00.960 --> 01:46:06.199
-—-—-

1089
01:46:06.199 --> 01:46:13.719
got gasoline or something yes sit man weaker then yes he answers

1090
01:46:13.719 --> 01:46:20.040
gasoline yes yes exactly yes v so your what you answer

1091
01:46:20.040 --> 01:46:27.080
on this so I said something that he would show etc. yes yes I was

1092
01:46:27.080 --> 01:46:31.480
curious exactly what you were

1093
01:46:32.880 --> 01:46:40.199
curious just like that then he sends to you 22 23 I'll leave two packages

1094
01:46:40.199 --> 01:46:43.280
strawberry outside to mock the strawberry you

1095
01:46:43.280 --> 01:46:47.520
know what do you think about it then the whole bit

1096
01:46:47.520 --> 01:46:50.880
yes I know

1097
01:46:51.840 --> 01:46:56.480
Not because I guess yes then you will be so S that if I am wrong because I guess that

1098
01:46:56.480 --> 01:47:00.080
Yet have had some control over this bunch of conflict with shootings and beds

1099
01:47:00.080 --> 01:47:06.320
and the like with the strawberry and fox and yes so I do not have very much

1100
01:47:06.320 --> 01:47:11.920
check no actually no but maybe a little even or no almost not

1101

1104
01:47:27.840 --> 01:47:31.000

1105
01:47:31.000 --> 01:47:36.199
The actors I didn't think okay

Laughed yes

1109

That's right

1110
01:47:59.880 --> 01:48:07.800
It then if we continue 115 then Leon will be spruce a little spruce where they are located

Yes yes H may a her organist and such a yes h had you reach you had any calls or

1112
01:48:15.760 --> 01:48:19.679
something during this period is in then obviously one

1113
01:48:19.679 --> 01:48:27.199
apartment eh i remember he e send a picture on on

1114
01:48:27.199 --> 01:48:32.599
Someone on the couch where he was in the light was the picture that I showed

01:48:37.560 --> 01:48:42.280
You saw the whole sofa you saw the whole sof okay yes though it was kind of the same picture

1117
01:48:42.280 --> 01:48:51.920
Although it was dark yes yes okay I understand

1118
01:48:55.080 --> 01:49:01.560
But since then 2247 here you asked but brother should not light no no brother sar

1119
01:49:01.560 --> 01:49:06.920
leen v gets the case today no i get the case i know

1120
01:49:06.920 --> 01:49:12.679
not yes I just ask yes because it sounds a little spruce that is like trying to

1121
01:49:12.679 --> 01:49:16.800
pushes him to do this anyway, but why did nothing happen why do

1122
01:49:16.800 --> 01:49:20.880
So I didn't push I just asked he yes I wanted so I wanted to know

1123
01:49:20.880 --> 01:49:27.800
What happens I was worried about Leon yes yes I can understand yes so I wanted to

1124
01:49:27.800 --> 01:49:33.679
Like knowing what happens yes so we actually see it there

1125
01:49:33.679 --> 01:49:41.960
Also the last there when 2248 you will be horned so horned tr but cheated yes yes

1126

Yes then further forward a little time here then

1128
01:49:51.639 --> 01:49:57.480
or 16 so do you ask when should you do it

1129
01:49:57.480 --> 01:50:02.119
Shouldn't you shoot someone yes so that is a little wrong

1130
01:50:02.119 --> 01:50:09.000
St my interpretation so s i will do it at two when

1131
01:50:09.560 --> 01:50:18.239
Depending yes where you get the money forget about movie

1132
01:50:18.239 --> 01:50:23.000
What is the last thing that really happened here

1133
01:50:23.000 --> 01:50:29.360
Yes in the evening v you had any call or something after this then no I

1134
01:50:29.360 --> 01:50:35.560
don't think so no no no i should not forget the answers on

1135
01:50:35.560 --> 01:50:40.719
the question to film and film the same as before or yes he said

1147
01:51:43.719 --> 01:51:47.679
Saying you are arrested when I was shocked that he was arrested when I thought has

1148
01:51:47.679 --> 01:51:51.079
he did it or not yes exactly what he said he was going home that he was not

1149
01:51:51.079 --> 01:51:55.119
would make it okay because you said before h I asked two

1160
01:52:55.480 --> 01:53:00.199

Eh but i don't know why i took screenshot if i should be honest no

1162
01:53:08.000 --> 01:53:13.159
okay right there late

1163
01:53:13.159 --> 01:53:18.159
so do you have sometime during time here now

1164
01:53:18.159 --> 01:53:24.840
Leon went on the train until you know that it is arrested you have

1165
01:53:24.840 --> 01:53:29.639
been in contact with the police or something

1166
01:53:29.639 --> 01:53:37.520
No and why don't you have it because e or what do you mean to

1167
01:53:37.520 --> 01:53:42.400
mean that you have found out of gradually but do you have the same the same

1168
01:53:42.400 --> 01:53:49.440
day he went or yes but if s yes exactly but f thought he ate at least i

1169
01:53:49.440 --> 01:53:53.960
had for with the police the day after yes but just yes it was when I told you everything

1170
01:53:53.960 --> 01:53:58.440
I know yes but then you knew that len said you were yes I read it on

1171
01:53:58.440 --> 01:54:03.360
The news yes exactly but I think so before Lean gets arrested when he like

1172
01:54:03.360 --> 01:54:09.280
have then gone off by the train and when it is ready for it then gradually that he

1173
01:54:09.280 --> 01:54:15.400
scolded a whole fucking apartment and similar that people will die

1174
01:54:15.400 --> 01:54:19.920
Yes why don't you contact the police then because I don't want people to go

1175
01:54:19.920 --> 01:54:27.920
To my gate and blast my gate no yes and contact the police anonymously then no

1176
01:54:27.920 --> 01:54:34.440
I didn't think about it no wasn't thinking about it no dde you at all

1177
01:54:34.440 --> 01:54:37.560
about what would happen to people that it was the idea that people would

1178
01:54:37.560 --> 01:54:45.520
die i didn't think so much no because it's still pretty badly thinking

1179
01:54:45.520 --> 01:54:52.520
If people put life into as well as yes etc.

1180
01:54:52.639 --> 01:54:56.560
Then there is actually an obligation to do this that if one now gets

1181
01:54:56.560 --> 01:55:00.480
knowledge that a seriously a very serious crime that is committed has

1182
01:55:00.480 --> 01:55:06.159
man an obligation as well as eh reveal this r actually

1183
01:55:06.159 --> 01:55:12.000
Yeah i have been expelled because i don't want people to go to my gate burst

1184
01:55:12.000 --> 01:55:18.639
my gate or kill me m yes since i didn't know one could be anonymous

1185
01:55:20.280 --> 01:55:25.320
No ok but about me but i but i about i

1186
01:55:25.320 --> 01:55:28.880
perceive that it is right here so you simply ignored it because you thought

1187
01:55:28.880 --> 01:55:32.560
that it is important that you yourself are safe

1188
01:55:32.679 --> 01:55:38.800
Then he had a little yes exactly mm yes plus he said he would he regretted

1189
01:55:38.800 --> 01:55:42.199

1190
01:55:42.199 --> 01:55:49.280
This one with Leon saying he was going home yes

1191
01:55:49.280 --> 01:55:56.639

1192
01:55:56.639 --> 01:56:00.040
have said that no one has asked the question I think it is important that it will

1193
01:56:00.040 --> 01:56:05.960
forward here in court yes yes it is not that you try to protect Leon simply

1194
01:56:05.960 --> 01:56:11.960
No after you found out that he himself says that Hanö bought voluntarily

1195

02:02:53.239 --> 02:02:58.480
And yes I believed he was going to Stockholm yes that was what he himself too

1258
02:02:58.480 --> 02:03:06.079
Thought yes eh but first took BLETT to Örebro etc. mm

1259
02:03:06.079 --> 02:03:12.000
and then reason you help him with how to change and s and so eh what

1260
02:03:12.000 --> 02:03:15.840
did you say it was eh he had a little battery and I experienced he as

1261
02:03:15.840 --> 02:03:23.760
stressed etc. so it was only to be able to travel by train to Örebro helped

1262
02:03:24.239 --> 02:03:27.239
mm

1263
02:03:29.719 --> 02:03:36.400
eh if we then look at these calls and as prosecutors

1264
02:03:36.400 --> 02:03:40.960
have gone through pretty unlucky now with

1265
02:03:42.679 --> 02:03:50.159
you v what prosecution mean here that you would have

1266
02:03:50.159 --> 02:03:57.360
encouraged him what is your thought when you talk to

1267
02:03:57.360 --> 02:04:05.000
him or writes with him fast s you said on prosecution question that you wanted to do

1268
02:04:05.000 --> 02:04:09.280
him stressed so he would not do anything

1269
02:04:09.280 --> 02:04:14.760
Without him would wonder

1270
02:04:14.760 --> 02:04:22.000
mm is your purpose as you think so you how long h you

1271
02:04:22.000 --> 02:04:28.559
And Leon Rust clearly acquainted and so there you had a good contact Johan so we

1272
02:04:28.559 --> 02:04:34.840
have not known each other for so long maybe two months max two three months yes yes

1273
02:04:34.840 --> 02:04:40.559
But then you have been hanging out of slippery time so we were with each other type every day yes so

1274
02:04:40.559 --> 02:04:43.800
you had had a good

1275
02:04:48.000 --> 02:04:53.480
relationship you eh thought too

1276
02:04:53.480 --> 02:05:03.960
on you were quite long time that went when Leon Rusk pondered on this he had

1277
02:05:03.960 --> 02:05:08.960
received this offer to step for even how long

1278
02:05:08.960 --> 02:05:18.480
about you think he talks about it one to three weeks etc. reach so and what was

1279
02:05:18.480 --> 02:05:25.239
your v hara you him and what do you think during these this time then I have

1280
02:05:25.239 --> 02:05:32.159
said he is not worth making it no you advised so way etc. mm and it was

1281
02:05:32.159 --> 02:05:41.559
every day he asked so he does and so don't

1282
02:05:41.920 --> 02:05:47.119
Mm you and then you yourself when

1283
02:05:47.119 --> 02:05:53.760
you man words a train ticket we have seen here eh eh to you you can just tell

1284
02:05:53.760 --> 02:06:00.280
briefly how it turned out it was you asked for a tret no i didn't pray for a toet

1285
02:06:00.280 --> 02:06:10.079
Eh but the idea was that I first made G yes how long eh it a maximum of 30

1286
02:06:10.079 --> 02:06:15.679
minutes an hour maybe after I said no I regretted so that it is a

1287
02:06:15.679 --> 02:06:24.000
half -hour hour as you first say and then you arrange with tet yes eh but they

1288
02:06:24.000 --> 02:06:29.079
I said it before they bought TB mm and they bought TB after I said I didn't

1289
02:06:29.079 --> 02:06:35.559
wanted yes but it was never used then no

1290
02:06:35.559 --> 02:06:41.639
Eh you yes we have seen in the conversation here at

1291
02:06:41.639 --> 02:06:47.320
that he was asked to bring as many friends as possible

1292
02:06:47.320 --> 02:06:55.520
Mm, there were more people who became when what you know, so people do not know about it but

1293
02:06:55.520 --> 02:07:00.400
not that they were offered etc. how many people thought it was who knew about it

1294
02:07:00.400 --> 02:07:07.400
Here I don't know quite a few but I can't say exact number no but 10

1295
02:07:07.400 --> 02:07:14.559
20 30 Yes but maybe F 10 had too

1296
02:07:14.559 --> 02:07:21.520
got iBand or eh I can't say that I don't know

1297
02:07:21.520 --> 02:07:26.679
feeling at least they knew it but not that they were allowed to offer

1298
02:07:26.679 --> 02:07:29.679
No

1299
02:07:32.440 --> 02:07:37.480
m you you see there too in these

1300
02:07:37.480 --> 02:07:42.559
the conversations and as the prosecutor has gone through here usually the analysis

1301
02:07:42.559 --> 02:07:49.480
eh you talk if you talk about weapons and you wanted a picture of the weapon and

1302
02:07:49.480 --> 02:07:55.760
said the revolver eh yes what what did you really know

1303
02:07:55.760 --> 02:08:00.280
you had he said that now I will have revolver and now I will

1304
02:08:00.280 --> 02:08:06.480
burn v do you get it from v no one has told him he is going to do

1305
02:08:06.480 --> 02:08:10.079
No that is what he thought he would do but no one has told him he

1306
02:08:10.079 --> 02:08:14.400
would do it was just speculation yes so he didn't know either he knew

1307
02:08:14.400 --> 02:08:17.400
not

1308
02:08:24.960 --> 02:08:33.119
After all, you hear here we have seen the first time on October 8 by the police etc. and

1309
02:08:33.119 --> 02:08:41.599
Then you are referred to witness yes etc. and then you told you that there was something

1310
02:08:41.599 --> 02:08:48.920
split for the fox yes yes but yes the police do not perceive anything

1311
02:08:48.920 --> 02:08:54.639
more about that then you are not heard for one and you are entirely on the loose between

1312
02:08:54.639 --> 02:09:01.760
October 8 and November 17 when you are arrested yes etc.

1313
02:09:01.760 --> 02:09:06.559
eh you are there many who contact you under it

1314
02:09:06.559 --> 02:09:13.280
the time or trying about what then or yes about everything about what you know about it and

1315
02:09:13.280 --> 02:09:18.760
what has happened and or do you contact some no it is mostly so that

1316
02:09:18.760 --> 02:09:21.960
There were people who under where was somewhere yes

1317
02:09:21.960 --> 02:09:26.960

1318
02:09:26.960 --> 02:09:31.960
Smögen when I told you what had happened etc. yes type

1319
02:09:31.960 --> 02:09:38.079
So it was in the newspapers pretty quickly yes there were quite a few who found out

1320
02:09:38.079 --> 02:09:41.880
that without them contacted me too

1321
02:09:42.000 --> 02:09:52.079
Yes but then you will be eg here on November 17 then and he

1322
02:09:52.079 --> 02:09:58.360

If you want yourself you don't have to say anything but you get that opportunity first

1394

Then the prosecutor will ask questions to you and your defender and others

1395
02:16:39.559 --> 02:16:44.000
Defenders should also have the opportunity and defendant at the tree, of course

But do you want to say something myself first yes I can start telling myself etc.

So helped him with it and then I got this for the code for my phone on sms

1404
02:17:22.760 --> 02:17:27.040
So as the prosecutor showed since I gave him the code and then he could activate

1411
02:17:56.920 --> 02:18:01.760
him the code also to my old snap and then when it comes to this to

1412
02:18:01.760 --> 02:18:05.519
one has shown that I have written to any girl on instagram that I sent

1413
02:18:05.519 --> 02:18:09.000
to her my old snap I have sent so I sent her my

1414
02:18:09.000 --> 02:18:13.240
old snap because I don't want to give her my what is the new snap then on

1415
02:18:13.240 --> 02:18:18.080
new snap I have only so few people who are familiar and so not as before I

1416
02:18:18.080 --> 02:18:22.479
had kind of 500 people people I didn't know and so yes on the new snap I

1417
02:18:22.479 --> 02:18:26.280
had only people I knew and my girlfriend then and my girlfriend she has what

1418
02:18:26.280 --> 02:18:30.200
is it called access to she has read the north to my new snap so she usually

1419
02:18:30.200 --> 02:18:34.000
Go through my new snap and check if I write with other girls and stuff like that

1420
02:18:34.000 --> 02:18:37.800
When h where the girl asked about my snap I sent this one my old one in case

1421
02:18:37.800 --> 02:18:41.760
and I ask why I didn't send my new and thus just old it was

1422
02:18:41.760 --> 02:18:45.240
That's why I sent old for my girl usually go through my snab and check for

1423
02:18:45.240 --> 02:18:48.160
I write with other girls and I usually use my old snap myself

1424
02:18:48.160 --> 02:18:51.399
So then when I usually go in write with other girls and since I have too

1425
02:18:51.399 --> 02:18:56.160
formed on my old snap that I usually go in and so use this yes try

1426
02:18:56.160 --> 02:19:01.479
Get hold of yes then when it comes to this crime so I knew

1427
02:19:01.479 --> 02:19:04.200
nothing about this I had nothing with this to do it was then it

1428
02:19:04.200 --> 02:19:11.399
the day after l voice was arrested when I got a call time in the morning such as

1429
02:19:11.399 --> 02:19:15.559
Man showed at 09 something I don't remember exactly but yes I got

1430
02:19:15.559 --> 02:19:20.719
A call of a number that had not saved on my phone so I replied

1431
02:19:20.719 --> 02:19:25.000
I asked what is the name of the person I just who is it and since it was Leon

1432
02:19:25.000 --> 02:19:28.679
alkri who died he said it was he since I was quick to ask i just what

1433
02:19:28.679 --> 02:19:33.639
How did you get my number and what do you want when he said he got to take on my number

1434
02:19:33.639 --> 02:19:37.240
by signal for one can see on the signal of others' persons number it is

1435
02:19:37.240 --> 02:19:40.599
As you can see what you don't have to ask the app itself to get information

1436
02:19:40.599 --> 02:19:45.960
There is, like you, you show for all the number so it is from there he received

1437
02:19:45.960 --> 02:19:50.399
My number he said and since he asked if I knew if R had been arrested so

1438
02:19:50.399 --> 02:19:54.520
I so no I knew nothing for the last time I had contact with rck it was

1439
02:19:54.520 --> 02:19:59.120
When we were placed at home together and I had him on my

1440
02:19:59.120 --> 02:20:02.439
old snap and I didn't have him on my new one then so I usually have contact with

1441
02:20:02.439 --> 02:20:08.080
him since too i have not h his phone number on someone else on

1442
02:20:08.080 --> 02:20:11.520
somewhere else on social media and to add people on what is it called

1443
02:20:11.520 --> 02:20:15.120
signal so you need phone numbers and i don't have h his

1444
02:20:15.120 --> 02:20:21.359
phone number then eh what is it called eh wait what was it yes explained that

1445
02:20:21.359 --> 02:20:25.200
With Signal Snapchat then what is it exactly called then what is it called this

1446
02:20:25.200 --> 02:20:29.000
the call when we didn't talk so long so it was max type f minutes or

1447
02:20:29.000 --> 02:20:34.120
Two minutes so on this conversation we what is called then he said he was alfredsson

1448
02:20:34.120 --> 02:20:38.040
he asked if I knew then where n r was as I said since I said that we

1449
02:20:38.040 --> 02:20:43.439
had contact then on v as I then said exactly yes what was this let me

1450
02:20:43.439 --> 02:20:46.840
remember yes exactly he asked if i knew since i told him now i knew

1451
02:20:46.840 --> 02:20:50.960
not for s go i had contact with him it was at hb home since he ask

1452
02:20:50.960 --> 02:20:53.479
So if I knew anything about this crime so I just no since I

1453
02:20:53.479 --> 02:20:56.960
So didn't believe myself I didn't even believe this that the guy had coded

1454
02:20:56.960 --> 02:21:00.520
for something or if he has done something so he only you can check

1455
02:21:00.520 --> 02:21:05.120
Internet search for it so I searched that picture from then what is it called

1456
02:21:05.120 --> 02:21:09.439
The article on my phone man has found out what is it called telephone emptying it is

1457
02:21:09.439 --> 02:21:13.960
from there eh I have the picture from what is the name of the act itself and

1458
02:21:13.960 --> 02:21:17.280
the one from there I saw that it was enon person who had been what is it called

1459
02:21:17.280 --> 02:21:22.840
arrested for general fuel when it was the present that was then for I

1460
02:21:22.840 --> 02:21:26.319
didn't even know what it means so i didn't think so much about it after

1461
02:21:26.319 --> 02:21:31.160
I loos on I don't know if it was right after or later in the day then

1462
02:21:31.160 --> 02:21:36.359
Because Leon Alfredsson told me this with that my number through signal then

1463
02:21:36.359 --> 02:21:41.000
I wanted to check so I downloaded signal on my phone and I wrote my

1464
02:21:41.000 --> 02:21:44.800
number i tried to log in m it did not go i think it might be so that

1465
02:21:44.800 --> 02:21:48.600
the person using the account thus linked to my number either he

1466
02:21:48.600 --> 02:21:52.439
has changed number or so he is called it deleted the account for it was not possible to

1467
02:21:52.439 --> 02:21:55.680
Login I don't know why or if there was anything else I have no one

1468
02:21:55.680 --> 02:21:59.399
Enter so I didn't think much about it that is why there is spore on my

1469
02:21:59.399 --> 02:22:08.040
Phone thus on the signal app then if what is called then wonders yes then when it

1470
02:22:08.040 --> 02:22:12.080
applies to these pictures that have been owed to eh in this picture of myself

1471
02:22:12.080 --> 02:22:18.080
where there is an r emoji an r emoji this picture it is taken on August 1st

1472
02:22:18.080 --> 02:22:22.000
You can see the date is up there if you check the time for prosecutors have posted to

1473
02:22:22.000 --> 02:22:26.240
it must have been created October 8th though it is not true it may be that I

1474
02:22:26.240 --> 02:22:29.560
took screenshot on October 8 in the picture itself but the picture itself has already

1475
02:22:29.560 --> 02:22:34.280
Been finished and posted on August 1st so why I have emojis thus

1476
02:22:34.280 --> 02:22:38.080
It was just an emoji I chose I have nothing with this conflict that

1477
02:22:38.080 --> 02:22:40.800
do or what gang I so I do not even belong to this conflict

1478
02:22:40.800 --> 02:22:45.359
or fst and so small have said I do not want to be involved in that

1479
02:22:45.359 --> 02:22:49.960
So I would not show to people that I belong to any network o so

1480
02:22:49.960 --> 02:22:54.760
because people would see that where it would hit me my family and so

1481
02:22:54.760 --> 02:22:58.280
Why should I show myself and r emoji the only thing I thought about I wanted to

1482
02:22:58.280 --> 02:23:02.240
only part joint i had in hand because i have v nam named family members on

1483
02:23:02.240 --> 02:23:07.319
Instagram so I put this emojin by the hand as you see in the picture it is there

1484
02:23:07.319 --> 02:23:10.439
I do not let it be so that I will be over my head or somewhere and

1485
02:23:10.439 --> 02:23:15.800
so like sinol I am going to be at hand because part jint had in hand and then

1486
02:23:15.800 --> 02:23:20.160
These other pictures then on Benzema and what is it called and what is it called

1487
02:23:20.160 --> 02:23:25.080
from the barrel conflicts but there were pictures you see clearly these

1488
02:23:25.080 --> 02:23:28.760
pictures they are taken from instagram and tictok there are no pictures like

1489
02:23:28.760 --> 02:23:32.080
people have sent to me and as I feel as I said I have no connection

1490
02:23:32.080 --> 02:23:37.240
to folkrot or any other k network these images they are taken from tiktok and

1491
02:23:37.240 --> 02:23:41.319
What is it called Instagram it from social media and you see it too

1492
02:23:41.319 --> 02:23:45.520
Look at the picture so then why I have it just on

1493
02:23:45.520 --> 02:23:48.640
My phone It is no wonder, so almost all young people in the whole of Sweden have

1494
02:23:48.640 --> 02:23:51.880
It on your phone and you follow what you read on news every day

1495
02:23:51.880 --> 02:23:56.160
What happens in Sweden thus this wave of violence then that e gates are blown up and

1496
02:23:56.160 --> 02:24:00.279
So like and I follow myself this conflict I have so I have yes

1497
02:24:00.279 --> 02:24:04.160
A little control over it not so much but I usually follow it on social media

1498
02:24:04.160 --> 02:24:08.680
Because it is rapping and so as is involved I usually listen to this one

1499
02:24:08.680 --> 02:24:15.399
the rapper I usually follow it so that's why I have it on my phone and yes late

1500
02:24:15.399 --> 02:24:18.319
It was also another I wanted to comment on that was this with that

1501
02:24:18.319 --> 02:24:23.200
Prosecutor he called the police Morgan what is it called regarding this

1502
02:24:23.200 --> 02:24:28.000
the intervention the day I want to tell you briefly too so you can hear my part too

1506
02:24:39.840 --> 02:24:44.080
The bus to school when I didn't know the police had saved but they had spam

1507
02:24:44.080 --> 02:24:47.760
on me they did not seize me outside the gate or so they followed me all the way

1508
02:24:47.760 --> 02:24:52.520
without me noticing to the bu station well there when i was well the bus d

1509

02:25:12.120 --> 02:25:15.920
So it's tv hurt I scream I just e letting go I turn I didn't know

1515
02:25:15.920 --> 02:25:19.600

they started screaming since you know people started to wonder the only buff arrived

1520
02:25:35.920 --> 02:25:40.319
He thought what the hell is H about since then h only we are police officers we are police officers

1521
02:25:40.319 --> 02:25:44.040
Then when they noticed people started coming to put me in the car where I asked them to

1522

1524
02:25:52.840 --> 02:25:56.800
there is something now in the car you will see you will see for times worse this so

1525
02:25:56.800 --> 02:25:59.439
I just won't do anything I did nothing since they pulled that one

1526
02:25:59.439 --> 02:26:02.160
the card yes you resist even though it made no resistance they jump on me

1527
02:26:02.160 --> 02:26:05.720
from nowhere so it was just the had you say and one to the thing I will

02:26:05.720 --> 02:26:10.439
Continue also be quiet I do not know what is it called eh will be quiet

1529
02:26:10.439 --> 02:26:14.800
Prosecutors can ask their questions and then I also know that this is serious

1530
02:26:14.800 --> 02:26:17.760
So brat as I suspected why not wanting to mention this person

1531
02:26:17.760 --> 02:26:22.040
who have to my snapchat and number so i don't want names in him

1532
02:26:22.040 --> 02:26:25.200
Because you know for yourself what it is, so it is nothing strange with the people they

1533
02:26:25.200 --> 02:26:28.720
get shot they get dead they get blasted for such things to be named

1534
02:26:28.720 --> 02:26:32.240
or man b out any person i don't want to get involved in anything i have

1535
02:26:32.240 --> 02:26:35.600
not with this conflict to do or reach some of the crime that

1536
02:26:35.600 --> 02:26:39.160
do I don't want to expose my family to proceed so I hope you understand and

1537
02:26:39.160 --> 02:26:44.359
respect what I will not name that person or any other yes is

1538
02:26:44.359 --> 02:26:51.120
Clearly thank you so much then prosecution should be given the opportunity to ask questions here etc. Thank you

1539
02:26:51.120 --> 02:26:56.800
The hello I was just thinking about asking you first you have during the police interrogations that held

1540
02:26:56.800 --> 02:27:02.399
with you exploited your right not to answer any questions or

1541
02:27:02.399 --> 02:27:08.240
How it is totally okay that you don't say anything but go I have to get

1542
02:27:08.240 --> 02:27:13.600
Asking Questions R St question is true that it does not say on

1543
02:27:13.600 --> 02:27:16.800
some questions on Len if you don't want to comment so you can just say none

1544
02:27:16.800 --> 02:27:20.359
comment can no no i will keep being quiet on yes okay yeah okay

1545
02:27:20.359 --> 02:27:25.359
So you are not going to answer that question now yes but on f may ask questions and about Ham

1546
02:27:25.359 --> 02:27:30.319
is quiet so may ask the next question simply reach well then then we run on it it is

1547
02:27:30.319 --> 02:27:35.720
No problem I noted as I said was that you in the police chose not to answer

1548
02:27:35.720 --> 02:27:41.120
some questions and you have now left a story today about your attitude toward

1549
02:27:41.120 --> 02:27:46.600
The different parts that you are added to load are because you have chosen to customize

1550
02:27:46.600 --> 02:27:50.640
it after the police investigation when it ends in life so you know what answers

1551
02:27:50.640 --> 02:27:54.560
suits you best as you do

1552
02:27:57.560 --> 02:28:01.880
So when it comes to [music]

1553
02:28:01.880 --> 02:28:07.279
eh why do you leave no comments during the police investigation it was because

1554
02:28:07.279 --> 02:28:11.920
you planned from the beginning that it adapted to

1555
02:28:13.160 --> 02:28:19.279
the investigation the telephone number that ends at 65 99 to telephone that was taken

1563
02:29:03.640 --> 02:29:08.359
signal contact that had borrowed

1564
02:29:13.359 --> 02:29:17.479
the telephone number about the explanation for the loan of

1565
02:29:17.479 --> 02:29:22.880
Signal Contact Phone Number Tie as to why he then needs to borrow

1566
02:29:22.880 --> 02:29:26.720
borrow the snap account as well where one does not have that type of eligibility requirement in order to

1567
02:29:26.720 --> 02:29:31.240
able to use snap you have to even e a phone this

1568
02:29:31.240 --> 02:29:36.439
the friend what is the name of this friend that

1569
02:29:42.319 --> 02:29:50.240
is meant how is it that this signal or sorry sn's

1570
02:29:50.240 --> 02:29:55.240
chat traffic that then this unknown friend would have committed

1571
02:29:55.240 --> 02:29:58.240
or lied behind it there is a shovel in your

1572
02:29:58.240 --> 02:30:04.279
phone which then not which then not the conversations

1573
02:30:04.279 --> 02:30:09.200
do if it is now that it is not you who used

1574
02:30:09.200 --> 02:30:13.640
the one we will come to these two accounts

1575
02:30:13.640 --> 02:30:16.399
used in parallel with each other with the same

1576
02:30:16.399 --> 02:30:22.920
content thus in large parts that is, both your signal button

1577
02:30:22.920 --> 02:30:26.840
Chat account is involved in the same conversations including the fact that reveal

1578
02:30:26.840 --> 02:30:32.439
Kill everyone and with Leon Alfredsson where one deals with that

1579
02:30:32.439 --> 02:30:38.720
upcoming deeds to happen and after event it will be it coming

1580
02:30:38.720 --> 02:30:44.120
itself that your phone is physically located with data traffic to Bengtsfors where you

1581
02:30:44.120 --> 02:30:48.040
written while I conversations happen although it is then

1582
02:30:48.040 --> 02:30:51.920
Late at night in the morning

1583
02:30:58.479 --> 02:31:04.680
If you have now used another Snapchat account which account have you used

1584
02:31:05.240 --> 02:31:11.680
then and how can you disclose a snapchat account to another person in that way

1585
02:31:11.680 --> 02:31:15.600
do not want to reach some kind of security regarding your own

1586
02:31:15.600 --> 02:31:19.880
Conversations your contacts

1587
02:31:20.040 --> 02:31:25.800
Although an old account which contacts did you have with Leon

1588
02:31:25.800 --> 02:31:29.120
Rustic at HVBhemmet

1589
02:31:30.279 --> 02:31:35.920
the conversation with Leon Alfsson you have threatened him with some time the same with

1590
02:31:35.920 --> 02:31:43.160
This is that you know where he lives somewhere for the guys to give up on him

1591
02:31:43.160 --> 02:31:47.200
sent his father's old address or

1592
02:31:47.720 --> 02:31:52.920
Similar have reached others who knew had that you had had a conversation

1593
02:31:52.920 --> 02:31:57.240
with Leon Alfredsson so that it is somehow reasonable for someone else

1594
02:31:57.240 --> 02:32:02.640
person could have done this in that case and in that case

1595
02:32:04.040 --> 02:32:08.960
who foxes symbol why do you send it the same

1596
02:32:08.960 --> 02:32:13.520
day if it is so that you send it the same day that the deed would have

1597
02:32:13.520 --> 02:32:19.000
happened why do you say you want to hide a joint where the whole exhaled air

1598
02:32:19.000 --> 02:32:23.760
in front of you of smoke so it is very clearly visible in the picture anyway what you hold on

1599
02:32:23.760 --> 02:32:30.359
with why sitting is straight over the hand

1600
02:32:33.080 --> 02:32:39.520
then it is a coincidence that you wear the fox on you while this goal and they

1601
02:32:39.520 --> 02:32:44.000
conversations that i have on you have sent is about stepping fst fox

1602
02:32:44.000 --> 02:32:48.120
is SL though

1603
02:32:50.200 --> 02:32:53.920
made the objection to the case that you have had no possibility that

1604
02:32:53.920 --> 02:32:59.040
Finance some kind of opportunity then I ask how it will be that 145000

1605
02:32:59.040 --> 02:33:03.479
SEK is taken at home in your apartment formally speaking from your brother the same day

1606
02:33:03.479 --> 02:33:09.240
As new rush wait what did you say SEK 145000 you are taken seized from a brother

1607
02:33:09.240 --> 02:33:14.040
the same day as an h not from him no from

1608
02:33:14.040 --> 02:33:18.720
The brother do you have any explanation for

1609
02:33:18.760 --> 02:33:22.319
that it is thinking about

1610
02:33:24.240 --> 02:33:30.680
go what do you have for you and Leon Alfon for quick contacts after the event itself

1611
02:33:30.680 --> 02:33:34.800
what is documented that it sent

1612
02:33:34.800 --> 02:33:42.240
things these eavesdropped conversations about stepping and that hungs have to gather together

1613
02:33:42.240 --> 02:33:49.319
paper and about big summer money your phone that has intercepted what

1614
02:33:49.319 --> 02:33:52.880
shop telling about that have you continued to have committed the same type of crime as not as

1615
02:33:52.880 --> 02:33:58.439
For here today it is a coincidence that it is talked about the same things that the person who

1616
02:33:58.439 --> 02:34:01.960
Should step

1617
02:34:01.960 --> 02:34:06.319
How can it be that you involved in that kind of conversation about it now have not

1618
02:34:06.319 --> 02:34:09.120
anything with this that

1619
02:34:17.800 --> 02:34:25.800
do why we changed viewing names on snap just on October 9, 2023 so close after

1620
02:34:25.800 --> 02:34:30.399
the incident why it was not happened before in that case if it was so that someone else

1621
02:34:30.399 --> 02:34:33.200
Person on this

1622
02:34:34.840 --> 02:34:40.640
Account What have you had for contact with Leon Alfson We Snapp in June It wants

1623
02:34:40.640 --> 02:34:45.560
say before the event what have you had contacts then

1624
02:34:50.439 --> 02:34:56.720
If now you are not who is behind the snapp conversations at the time of crime

1625
02:34:56.720 --> 02:35:02.040
which occurs together that occurs with Len Rustic and

1626
02:35:02.040 --> 02:35:07.040
counterpart so I asked the question before will they be on your phone then

1627
02:35:07.040 --> 02:35:11.640
Ask the next question H will parts of them the most incriminating parts that

1628
02:35:11.640 --> 02:35:15.720
they are deleted on your phone that you see that they are found not which

1629
02:35:15.720 --> 02:35:18.720
content

1630
02:35:19.880 --> 02:35:22.760
Then as we certainly from Leon

1631
02:35:27.080 --> 02:35:32.680
led how could you know that it was just in Örebro you would look for a TRT

1632
02:35:32.680 --> 02:35:39.120
Violent acts where Leon Rusti was involved after you talked to Leon Alfsson how

1633
02:35:39.120 --> 02:35:43.720
Did you know what event you would look for it G so many people in Sweden

1634
02:35:43.720 --> 02:35:48.640
for a day it could know that it was, after all, the one who makes an impression on the page

1635
02:35:48.640 --> 02:35:57.240
168 in the analysis that your phone for the morning of 8

1636
02:36:06.600 --> 02:36:13.920
October is that you have instigated this that it is you who lies

1637
02:36:13.920 --> 02:36:20.080
behind chatting there when Leon Alfson is being able to try to look at the song that we

1638
02:36:20.080 --> 02:36:22.520
talking about

1639
02:36:31.439 --> 02:36:36.840
Today we'll see I'll just double check what you said before

1640
02:36:45.000 --> 02:36:51.680
Even if you are now so afraid to be associated with the Fox network as you actually did

1641
02:36:51.680 --> 02:36:56.960
As you said it was then it turns out that you are so careful that you

1642
02:36:56.960 --> 02:37:04.000
sitting with what at least I interpret as a rä symbol on your left hand in

1643
02:37:04.000 --> 02:37:08.920
photographs that you yourself say you have shared with

1644
02:37:17.160 --> 02:37:21.160
of mm

1645
02:37:28.080 --> 02:37:34.040
Thanks thank you so much then your defense or we will go for the go on for forgetting here

1646
02:37:34.040 --> 02:37:38.279
Well, no thanks no questions no then you should defend for opportunity here please

1647
02:37:38.279 --> 02:37:42.600
Yes I was going to ask Hansa you reply if you want but prosecution mentioned this one

1648
02:37:42.600 --> 02:37:47.240
the audio file where it is mentioned to step and I can for your knowledge so that it happens

1649
02:37:47.240 --> 02:37:52.279
Two weeks after e rus understand this event, you want to say something about

1650
02:37:52.279 --> 02:37:56.399
It yes, exactly this thing this thing does not have with this goal

1651
02:37:56.399 --> 02:38:00.040
at all to do since I am not talking about something step or

1652
02:38:00.040 --> 02:38:03.279
something that is another person who calls it is he who says and it is about

1653
02:38:03.279 --> 02:38:07.240
Completely different thing he says I can fix a guy so it is not with it that

1654
02:38:07.240 --> 02:38:14.200
do talk about completely different kiss and this with paper and Åkl paper would

1655
02:38:14.200 --> 02:38:18.760
Picked up and such stuff that it would be yes so prosecutors try to get it

1656
02:38:18.760 --> 02:38:21.200
here looks like it has to do with this goal of doing it has nothing with it

1657
02:38:21.200 --> 02:38:26.160
Here's the goal of making that conversation it was that it was the day we helped

1658
02:38:26.160 --> 02:38:29.760
a friend and move and I hurt me and I also see in the conversation I

1659
02:38:29.760 --> 02:38:33.319
Only I injured can pick up gloves work gloves in order to thus

1660
02:38:33.319 --> 02:38:36.600
help with the move and I say it took a round we will load on

1661
02:38:36.600 --> 02:38:41.760
stuff and since I ask the guy he lives near this eh what is that apartment

1662
02:38:41.760 --> 02:38:45.800
we would move and where there were no papers or anything so I needed

1663
02:38:45.800 --> 02:38:48.920
Paper So here I have Papers now you understand it has nothing with burned

1664
02:38:48.920 --> 02:38:52.120
to do otherwise if it would be with it wrestles could have said yes picked up

1665
02:38:52.120 --> 02:38:55.520
happens gasoline or something but it is just paper it is nothing that way

1666
02:38:55.520 --> 02:39:02.200
illegal with paper no and rustic and you have been sitting on HVB or have feel

1667
02:39:02.200 --> 02:39:07.920
you any other of those sitting here today no no no no it is not true

1668
02:39:07.920 --> 02:39:11.040
defended or do you know someone else like do you have yes no so I feel

1669
02:39:11.040 --> 02:39:14.120
no one else before, so I do not know SMS owners even why should I do

1670
02:39:14.120 --> 02:39:17.160
something or instigating someone to do something n not I know the people

1671
02:39:17.160 --> 02:39:20.080
Why what do I have against them, even though I knew people I would never

1672
02:39:20.080 --> 02:39:25.600
do sow this crime etc. and I showed during the case here that your

1673
02:39:25.600 --> 02:39:30.479
this snapkit old that it said it was in Skåne and then is mine

1674
02:39:30.479 --> 02:39:33.640
Ask you have yes exactly that, yes exactly it is true that it was in

1675
02:39:33.640 --> 02:39:37.760
Skåne that too but you can say that the person who was at the account at the time

1676
02:39:37.760 --> 02:39:42.160
he was in Skåne such as Alfred who told me that one could see the person

1677
02:39:42.160 --> 02:39:45.640
wherever he was at the police station anything where it was the same thing here man

1678
02:39:45.640 --> 02:39:48.840
can see where exactly the person is the one who uses the account and he is in

1679
02:39:48.840 --> 02:39:51.600
Skåne and I have never been one to Skåne in my entire life never been in

1680
02:39:51.600 --> 02:39:55.040
Scan never i have no connections to Skåne okay then the prosecutor mentions that

1681
02:39:55.040 --> 02:39:59.920
Your phone has been active There are data and connections at the time and for

1682
02:39:59.920 --> 02:40:04.920

1684
02:40:07.640 --> 02:40:11.920
all the time and then also eh it even stands for itself the preliminary investigation to

1685
02:40:11.920 --> 02:40:15.760

1686
02:40:15.760 --> 02:40:18.920

1695
02:40:59.800 --> 02:41:04.800
And then Sandra now for this goes in the same way as for the others here to

1696
02:41:04.800 --> 02:41:09.319
you first get the opportunity to say anything here if you want if it is as

1697
02:41:09.319 --> 02:41:14.319
Prosecutors claim that you have done eh and then the prosecution will have the opportunity to

1698
02:41:14.319 --> 02:41:19.720
Ask questions and goals know the tree and then all the defenders EH will first

1699

1704

02:43:01.600 --> 02:43:05.960
closer to one of the microphones so where yes came picture

1720
02:43:05.960 --> 02:43:12.920
then so yeah so you can talk to more into the microphone so it hears you want to take over

1721
02:43:12.920 --> 02:43:22.720
that you sn all yes you you you said your v called yes and then he asked if I

1722
02:43:22.720 --> 02:43:29.359
could lend my apartment eh because I don't live there but I live with a

1723
02:43:29.359 --> 02:43:34.359
other so it said he would be allowed to borrow mine

1724
02:43:34.359 --> 02:43:40.800
Apartment I got a time I was going to meet him at the station and so took

1725
02:43:40.800 --> 02:43:47.680
we taxi home to me eh and then I showed him around the apartment and then pulled

1726
02:43:47.680 --> 02:43:50.080
I from there

1727
02:43:51.760 --> 02:43:57.680
Was there something else in the apartment then no not what I know I remember I was

1728
02:43:57.680 --> 02:44:02.520
very affected so it may have been where I actually don't know mm was there anybody

1729
02:44:02.520 --> 02:44:08.000
person whom you knew who agreed to his element as Larson has mentioned no

1730
02:44:08.000 --> 02:44:12.520
It is not amigo as angry seat or similar no absolutely not no okay he

1732
02:44:18.359 --> 02:44:24.960
but then so simple you eh who is this friend when it needs

1733
02:44:24.960 --> 02:44:29.520
we don't go into mm and just so we understand then

1734
02:44:29.520 --> 02:44:34.120
each other clearly and clearly you know who it is but don't want to tell you this

1735
02:44:34.120 --> 02:44:42.760
mm okay eh know Daniel this friend yes m it makes h okay you can just tell

1736
02:44:42.760 --> 02:44:46.680
A little grom with you and Daniel so the relationship gets ready for us so say that

1737
02:44:46.680 --> 02:44:50.720
you have been married like that but can we tell yourself yes what should I say we were married

1738
02:44:50.720 --> 02:44:56.439
and then he started taking heroin and then I left him etc. and when in time we are

1739
02:44:56.439 --> 02:44:59.520
then about it was probably a month before

1740
02:44:59.520 --> 02:45:05.640
This happens, etc. he has been shown something in your apartment after that

1741
02:45:05.640 --> 02:45:11.160
No you are sure of no I am not but not when i have been there in all

1742
02:45:11.160 --> 02:45:18.399
Case when you've been there no okay What is what are you knowing

1743
02:45:18.399 --> 02:45:24.399
about the friend and why should you do this no it was nothing special at all

1744
02:45:24.399 --> 02:45:29.720
would come h so get a friend he just said mm there was nothing strange at all

1745
02:45:29.720 --> 02:45:36.080
mm he has set up and let me be allowed to live with him then but feel acquaintance to

1746
02:45:36.080 --> 02:45:42.200
him and so there so there was no weirdness no f they speak none

1747
02:45:42.200 --> 02:45:46.200
weirdness where I claim that you are interrogation early and told it it was

1748
02:45:46.200 --> 02:45:53.840
A friend of you who would come no friend yeah yeah okay okay and that i said

1749
02:45:53.840 --> 02:46:00.520
from the beginning too okay just right

1750
02:46:01.080 --> 02:46:05.840
What I thought we might be able to take it right away so it gets clarified

1751
02:46:05.840 --> 02:46:15.080
Page 569 Here mentioned a task eh it g that summary in itself

1752
02:46:15.399 --> 02:46:20.920
But in the middle here, the question if you remembered you would meet someone it

1753
02:46:20.920 --> 02:46:24.960
day and then we talk on October 7 when m eh then the answer is the police have

1754
02:46:24.960 --> 02:46:30.800
Signed here now yes but you know that I have done me what should I say

1755
02:46:30.800 --> 02:46:35.760
So I lend the apartment to a friend friend for it to come on

1756
02:46:35.760 --> 02:46:41.040
Visit I didn't know it again anything I don't have to do with that then have

1757
02:46:41.040 --> 02:46:47.800
the police wrote wrong there then it will so my friend's friend yeah okay exactly what I was

1758
02:46:47.800 --> 02:46:52.399
after all, from the start but that you are not my friend etc. without it being a

1759
02:46:52.399 --> 02:46:57.920
friend of him and when you meet up Leon then

1760
02:46:57.920 --> 02:47:04.200
what like what have you been told about that meeting then nothing I got a

1761
02:47:04.200 --> 02:47:11.240
Time I would be at the eh station so I went there and stood there then and

1762
02:47:11.240 --> 02:47:16.240
Then he came up to me He recognized me well I think

1763
02:47:16.240 --> 02:47:20.840
mm just that mm

1764
02:47:20.880 --> 02:47:28.720
And yes what do what do you do then eh we take a taxi to me

1765
02:47:28.720 --> 02:47:33.880
mm do you buy something yes i buy a lighter he asked if i had lighter

1766
02:47:33.880 --> 02:47:37.359
so i went in and bought a teeth and so mm and so i was inside and bought a

1767
02:47:37.359 --> 02:47:41.399
Candy bag for myself before just that so first you buy a candy bag for you

1768
02:47:41.399 --> 02:47:45.640
yourself and then so when get there so you buy a lit for him

1769
02:47:45.640 --> 02:47:51.200
Yeah how will s you buy a lit for him when he asked for a lighter yes

1770
02:47:51.200 --> 02:47:55.439
Then I said I can go in and buy one for you and why was it so to Mö Skå

1771
02:47:55.439 --> 02:48:00.240
then but then it is no wonder why would I not be

1772
02:48:00.240 --> 02:48:06.479
my friends' friends are my friends yes okay yes you had no liters of own

1773
02:48:06.479 --> 02:48:12.200
from the beginning no okay no one i wanted to give anyway no

1774
02:48:12.200 --> 02:48:17.120
Okay I understand then we have looked at pictures and movies and stuff like that

1775
02:48:17.120 --> 02:48:20.960
until when you receive this lights up the money too and pick up

1776
02:48:20.960 --> 02:48:24.680
Something on the floor can you tell us a little about your own words like what is happening no

1777
02:48:24.680 --> 02:48:28.560
It is nothing strange so I have been convicted before because they have found

1778
02:48:28.560 --> 02:48:34.240
my DNA stuff on site my lawyer here showed when he did

1779
02:48:34.240 --> 02:48:39.359
case request so I may not really want to leave me a lighter for

1780
02:48:39.359 --> 02:48:47.200
I don't know if he is going out on less crime eh type go out and break storage on

1781
02:48:47.200 --> 02:48:51.880
evenings or so there are many of my friends who do it etc. Don't you trust

1782
02:48:51.880 --> 02:48:56.920
The no, but it is not that difficult, so you can lose a lighter when

1783
02:48:56.920 --> 02:49:01.680
You are out of it is no wonder they have even find

1784
02:49:01.680 --> 02:49:08.080
Computers and stuff that belongs to Örebro Municipality in my cars so that so friend's

1785
02:49:08.080 --> 02:49:10.960
friends it is not going like all the way it is not that you trust them for

1786
02:49:10.960 --> 02:49:16.840
A thing so -called I trust him he would never put anything on the spot

1787
02:49:16.840 --> 02:49:21.920
intention but it is easy to lose if you are out and make stuff small

1788
02:49:21.920 --> 02:49:26.479
criminal things deeds but means that you understood that this is

1789
02:49:26.479 --> 02:49:29.399
about crime that was what one did no it was not so i said now

1790
02:49:29.399 --> 02:49:34.319
Do you distort my sentences yes no I just ask but it wore it

1791
02:49:34.319 --> 02:49:39.319
appreciated I don't know what other people do on their

1792
02:49:39.319 --> 02:49:46.080
leisure this with that you were afraid to leave DNA on the lighter it is after all

1793
02:49:46.080 --> 02:49:51.200
something that I claim has not come up with anything for police with has done it

1794
02:49:51.200 --> 02:49:56.760
was the first thing i said j jaar i history because i don't want to

1795
02:49:56.760 --> 02:50:01.760
My friend is going to get involved in this and it is for my own safety now I

1796
02:50:01.760 --> 02:50:06.120
not with fix take me now prime.se

1797
02:50:07.640 --> 02:50:10.640
Ok

1798
02:50:12.399 --> 02:50:17.120
Mm precisely that because there is information about

1799
02:50:17.120 --> 02:50:19.960
For example

1800
02:50:20.760 --> 02:50:23.840
Looking at the page

1801
02:50:24.640 --> 02:50:30.760
588 so you have there is some other explanation for this tend

1802
02:50:30.760 --> 02:50:33.800
first stick yes as I just said just right

1803
02:50:33.800 --> 02:50:38.960
just so I didn't want my friend to get involved in this for my

1804
02:50:38.960 --> 02:50:42.760
own safety so I came up with one

1805
02:50:42.760 --> 02:50:49.279
Other version etc. But now we are so far so now I feel that it better to

1806
02:50:49.279 --> 02:50:54.520
I am honest yes just that but if we say this then then need

1807
02:50:54.520 --> 02:50:57.920
We don't read anything is true that it was before the sign on among the

1808
02:50:57.920 --> 02:51:01.640
Other risk of Corona Eh

1809
02:51:01.640 --> 02:51:08.279
compulsive thoughts yes, although it is true to a certain extent also do it but that is true

1810
02:51:08.279 --> 02:51:15.430
that I have said that etc. Okay I understand ehm

1811
02:51:15.430 --> 02:51:18.540
[Music]

1812
02:51:19.960 --> 02:51:24.439
But to leave Leon in this case alone in the apartment as well as how did you think

1813
02:51:24.439 --> 02:51:31.359
around it then yes it is my friend's responsibility that his friends take care of themselves in my

1814
02:51:31.359 --> 02:51:36.920
Housing yes just as I did in his friends

1815
02:51:36.920 --> 02:51:41.800
Housing but you talk about people putting the municipality's computers in your car

1816
02:51:41.800 --> 02:51:46.040
and other things that you dare not leave DNA on lit and yet like you sound

1817
02:51:46.040 --> 02:51:50.880
him stay there and alone as you say trusts well that she does not reason yes

1818
02:51:50.880 --> 02:51:58.120
How can you trust him then I don't know v I will explain to

1819
02:51:58.120 --> 02:52:03.239
the sake of clarity I do not know what to form so that you understand me right in

1820
02:52:03.239 --> 02:52:10.439
This I don't know who he is no I don't know what he's doing I know that around

1821
02:52:10.439 --> 02:52:15.840
my friends and me so there are very criminal acts that are not done

1822
02:52:15.840 --> 02:52:21.920
murder and none of them without people out and break at nights in advance and stuff etc.

1823
02:52:21.920 --> 02:52:27.040
and that I leave from a lighter to someone I don't know if he is holding on

1824
02:52:27.040 --> 02:52:32.479
with that and he drops the one I know there are many others who have

1825
02:52:32.479 --> 02:52:36.800
lost several times when they have been out they have been allowed to go back to the scene

1826
02:52:36.800 --> 02:52:42.080
and pick up their stuff but that doesn't mean i think

1827
02:52:42.080 --> 02:52:47.880
that he is going to do something like that and I trust he doesn't cut away from me etc.

1828
02:52:47.880 --> 02:52:51.960
I t, for example, that I could leave the theft in your apartment without

1829
02:52:51.960 --> 02:52:56.479
been out and broken and only contact to Örebro is just your apartment so that

1830
02:52:56.479 --> 02:53:01.880
haven't I even thought of no okay no but then so it understands

1831
02:53:01.880 --> 02:53:08.479
ehm in the taxi then you can tell us a little about the trip then who is paying and and and

1832
02:53:08.479 --> 02:53:13.840
so on it is me who pay I got a smaller s of money etc. but I

1833
02:53:13.840 --> 02:53:20.359
Where did my friend meet and then it was said that I would pay the taxi with them and

1834
02:53:20.359 --> 02:53:27.760
then he would get the rest of the money that was over mm okay eh so we went and took

1835
02:53:27.760 --> 02:53:32.600
a taxi only i paid then i gave him the money okay how much money got

1836
02:53:32.600 --> 02:53:39.080
he i don't know exactly a 1000 patch 1500 it was food for a few days mm we stepped

1837
02:53:39.080 --> 02:53:43.560
off in by the ground too for me to show him where closest wants to beat yes yes

1838
02:53:43.560 --> 02:53:49.399
yeah just that for you i never have food home with me no no okay

1839
02:53:49.399 --> 02:53:51.560
just

1840
02:53:52.040 --> 02:53:58.279
it would you get something yourself for this you have a friend no it was my friend

1841
02:53:58.279 --> 02:54:03.840
He needed a favor etc he needed help and he is very lonely so I

1842
02:54:03.840 --> 02:54:07.720
thought it was fun for H that he would get friends who came to say okay

1843
02:54:07.720 --> 02:54:12.520
And when when was it you got this money and the mission itself then eh yes

1844
02:54:12.520 --> 02:54:18.439
It was probably an hour before I was m it an hour before yes okay so before

1845
02:54:18.439 --> 02:54:23.600
it knows absolutely nothing then but no okay

1846
02:54:23.600 --> 02:54:29.120
Mm have you seen any gasoline can or bottle similar to those we have seen in here in

1847
02:54:29.120 --> 02:54:37.160
the apartment something nothing such no you when it comes to this money then gets

1848
02:54:37.160 --> 02:54:41.000
you correct if i'm wrong but you have i say you have left completely different

1849
02:54:41.000 --> 02:54:45.920
information about where this money comes from eye eh I said well that I was

1850
02:54:45.920 --> 02:54:50.880
my so -called money first then yes but just yes no it is not true as I said

1851
02:54:50.880 --> 02:54:58.319
keep my friend outside here mm mm okay but then so and Sandra told in

1852
02:54:58.319 --> 02:55:02.479
later interrogation that the points come from the friend or how yes yes but I

1853
02:55:02.479 --> 02:55:06.160
still want to double check the ones that exist

1854
02:55:07.359 --> 02:55:14.120
Here's exactly that and what about this bike as it is not my bike I

1855
02:55:14.120 --> 02:55:17.760
thought it was there first because i had a black bike but it was full black

1856
02:55:17.760 --> 02:55:22.880
my cy bike etc so I know nothing about that bike okay and what was it like

1857
02:55:22.880 --> 02:55:27.399
In fact, it fck it to come to the conclusion that it was no longer a bike then

1858
02:55:27.399 --> 02:55:32.399
mine was completely black mm I see the pictures it is marks on that bike

1859
02:55:32.399 --> 02:55:37.840
Who has where I have read pel yes yes in it there are pictures of the bike etc. and

1860
02:55:37.840 --> 02:55:44.160
it has marks on it it had not mine was whole black okay so that bike that

1861
02:55:44.160 --> 02:55:48.800
had got rid of when it has disappeared in some other way then yes etc.

1862
02:55:48.800 --> 02:55:54.279
the same day from your apartment no it wasn't what I said no I wasn't

1863
02:55:54.279 --> 02:56:01.479
back to my apartment before the days just before I was arrested yes okay but

1864
02:56:01.479 --> 02:56:06.399
that the bike has made it from an apartment as yes I even think it

1865
02:56:06.399 --> 02:56:12.800
is in the pupa being that my I had a friend lived with me where I suspect that

1866
02:56:12.800 --> 02:56:17.239
it is he who has taken the bike from there when the police threw him out let my

1867
02:56:17.239 --> 02:56:25.080
apartment etc. Without approval on my side okay and who was this then we

1868
02:56:25.080 --> 02:56:31.920
don't have to go into name no no there is m up there too

1869
02:56:32.120 --> 02:56:35.439
Mm just

1870
02:56:35.840 --> 02:56:39.560
It mm late

1871
02:56:39.560 --> 02:56:47.359
eh we were inside a little neighbor at Daniel there so where he had he had stuck you said

1872
02:56:47.359 --> 02:56:51.359
have you like have you and Daniel been in contact something in conjunction with

1873
02:56:51.359 --> 02:56:57.200
this event no because we have a purely now one

1874
02:56:57.200 --> 02:57:01.920
connection between you and Daniel as his DNA is on that cans and on a couple

1875
02:57:01.920 --> 02:57:08.000
Gloves when smile clutch do you mean yes the clutch is

1876
02:57:08.000 --> 02:57:13.960
it is that when Leon is arrested, there is there on or at his person's objects that

1877
02:57:13.960 --> 02:57:20.160
has daniels it doesn't have to mean that me and Daniel have had contact no so

1878
02:57:21.319 --> 02:57:27.319
For sorry it's just indications everything it just indications yes

1879
02:57:27.319 --> 02:57:31.840
okay [music]

1880
02:57:31.840 --> 02:57:37.279
Mm but i think like this now you have any control over if Daniel was something in your

1881
02:57:37.279 --> 02:57:41.200
apartment if when you were not there no I have not

1882
02:57:41.200 --> 02:57:47.080
No i had no key i can't lock you have asked your friend anything about

1883
02:57:47.080 --> 02:57:52.000
This then how it is related to no I have not why do you not have it why

1884
02:57:52.000 --> 02:57:56.080
would I therefore be suspected of crime which you know after

1885
02:57:56.080 --> 02:58:01.920
Like the police fuk on yes but I have already heard everything from my friend

1886
02:58:01.920 --> 02:58:06.359
and what did you hear from your friend then we need we don't have to go into it we

1887
02:58:06.359 --> 02:58:11.239
can leave my friend outside it mm Although you do not talk about him anymore without

1888
02:58:11.239 --> 02:58:14.080
just about the information that you have provided to you that is, what you have known to

1889
02:58:14.080 --> 02:58:19.760
and once you know that no comment

1890
02:58:19.760 --> 02:58:23.359
Okay then

1891
02:58:27.520 --> 02:58:32.960
So these gloves that Leer is wearing when he arrests recognize they are for your

1892
02:58:32.960 --> 02:58:36.120
Apartment No.

1893
02:58:36.840 --> 02:58:43.080
No just like that then we have some searches too

1894
02:58:43.080 --> 02:58:48.239
on this event on your phone thus quite late after the incident is

1895
02:58:48.239 --> 02:58:53.200
It no wonder what is it strange about it yes but tell me what should

1896
02:58:53.200 --> 02:58:58.720
I tell me why were you why not that is what is it I would

1897
02:58:58.720 --> 02:59:03.880
prove h saying this is what you are suspected of crime I claim that you have done

1898
02:59:03.880 --> 02:59:07.520
one more divorced to Medh for preparation for murder yes I know I have taken it

1899
02:59:07.520 --> 02:59:12.200
And of course I wonder why you have sought information for this

1900
02:59:12.200 --> 02:59:15.560
the incident that you are suspected of that makes you sit here today yes I know

1901
02:59:15.560 --> 02:59:20.920
not you know don't believe yourself no you may not set you may not

1902
02:59:20.920 --> 02:59:25.399
ask questions back and the prosecutor is trying to formulate questions and then so

1903
02:59:25.399 --> 02:59:29.239
Do you choose whether or not to answer so that prosecutors try to formulate questions

1904
02:59:29.239 --> 02:59:33.439
And and Sandra Petterson does not ask questions back on the prosecution why

1905
02:59:33.439 --> 02:59:38.160
Have you searched for information about the one I knew I was withdrawn in that

1906
02:59:38.160 --> 02:59:44.200
m and I knew my ex -man was detained for that so it is clear about

1907
02:59:44.200 --> 02:59:48.600
one is interested and wonders what it is

1908
02:59:48.600 --> 02:59:52.399
where it says it will cod soon it means

1909
02:59:52.399 --> 02:59:56.200
Nothing means nothing no it means nothing i sit here five

1910
02:59:56.200 --> 03:00:01.520
months later or how but it doesn't say i'm prime.se have you

1911
03:00:01.520 --> 03:00:05.640
cod now yes apparently I have r because i sit here after five

1912
03:00:05.640 --> 03:00:12.160
months okay okay then so cod it doesn't mean that

1913
03:00:12.160 --> 03:00:19.880
one is guilty in any way one can cod innocent as well

1914
03:00:19.880 --> 03:00:26.520
Okay but if you get suspected of crime you have coded then or are to be judged

1915
03:00:26.520 --> 03:00:31.439
first but you cod you do when you get locked up if you become

1916
03:00:31.439 --> 03:00:39.399
arrested in i i i a lob it does not mean that you owe no man can

1917
03:00:39.399 --> 03:00:46.920
cod as innocent mm during the time as you before you were arrested after the event

1918
03:00:46.920 --> 03:00:50.000
So do you have after I think change phone numbers then so you have swap

1919
03:00:50.000 --> 03:00:55.200
Phone Numba wand once va according to can see not even twice yes why

1920
03:00:55.200 --> 03:00:59.880
have you done it as it is not something strange I change the phone to

1921
03:00:59.880 --> 03:01:03.760
phone numbers as often i change lingerie so it always has been for

1922
03:01:03.760 --> 03:01:08.439
me why is it so because they get stolen they disappear i drop them

1923
03:01:08.439 --> 03:01:14.840
The kids have Sunder them etc. Okay I understand but just that it happens

1924
03:01:14.840 --> 03:01:18.279
so closely related to this event with something somewhat active choice only one

1925
03:01:18.279 --> 03:01:25.279
pure coincidence yes just a pure coincidence and I wish and this so with the phase in hand

1926
03:01:25.279 --> 03:01:31.200
so had I wanted to have the phone left etc that I had then and why had

1927
03:01:31.200 --> 03:01:36.640
you wanted it then because I had a prove even more of my virginity in this

1928
03:01:36.640 --> 03:01:42.399
Okay what had we found then nothing okay that is exactly what is the thing ie

1929
03:01:42.399 --> 03:01:48.640
found as little as this time okay mm

1930
03:01:48.640 --> 03:01:52.600
and why do you stay away from the police where because i put to do be ill

1931
03:01:52.600 --> 03:01:57.040
I didn't stay away I was sick but you sat if saying so here is

1932
03:01:57.040 --> 03:02:00.319

1974
03:05:39.080 --> 03:05:42.840
you tell us anything about your condition your health condition and how

1975
03:05:42.840 --> 03:05:49.040
had been the time before the police eh it wasn't good I was bedridden in two

1976
03:05:49.040 --> 03:05:54.720
months m simply i had kidneybäck infection and so i had an infection in

1977
03:05:54.720 --> 03:05:59.920
the spine while the doctor missed etc so I was in to urgently when I went

1978
03:05:59.920 --> 03:06:03.920
Ambulance in the first time etc. I understand on what you told you have followed

1979
03:06:03.920 --> 03:06:10.040
reporting about this mm eh when and how did you realize that your ex -man Daniel

1980
03:06:10.040 --> 03:06:18.439
where was deprived of liberty pretty fast yes my friend called me yes pretty fast yes

1981
03:06:18.439 --> 03:06:22.120
is it only then that you get to know about it when he is already

1982
03:06:22.120 --> 03:06:25.239
Liberty now I did not understand it was then in Samand with the fact that he was

1983
03:06:25.239 --> 03:06:28.200
detainee as you understood it was

1984
03:06:28.200 --> 03:06:34.920
Just then eh you tell you that it will be until early December

1985
03:06:34.920 --> 03:06:41.040
Eh what have you known and what have you had an idea of the police's interest in

1986
03:06:41.040 --> 03:06:44.600
For you as we know, after all, in this investigation is there, so I have understood

1987
03:06:44.600 --> 03:06:51.160
that they have wanted to have me eh on interrogation yes eh but I didn't think it was

1988
03:06:51.160 --> 03:06:55.760
that I was as seriously involved as I am because one time for it

1989
03:06:55.760 --> 03:07:01.399
Booked interrogation before I was sick so it was quite long between the dates

1990
03:07:01.399 --> 03:07:07.359
from when at the hearing would be sky so you have known and you have been called

1991
03:07:07.359 --> 03:07:14.760
to to police interrogation yes through contact with the police yes yoke you and you mentioned so

1992
03:07:14.760 --> 03:07:21.319

1993
03:07:23.479 --> 03:07:28.239
ehm you tell you about your illness and we can too

1994
03:07:28.239 --> 03:07:32.279
eh backwards you have told you and it appears that you have a

1995
03:07:32.279 --> 03:07:38.040
abuse problems bit made clear that it did not include heroin but during

1996
03:07:38.040 --> 03:07:43.319
this period around the crime and until you seize how was it with

1997
03:07:43.319 --> 03:07:48.080

2030
03:10:56.399 --> 03:11:00.880
time in early September so he was not at home when I got home one day

2031
03:11:00.880 --> 03:11:06.760
eh you touched it but in terms of access to the apartment eh how has

2032
03:11:06.760 --> 03:11:11.840
It has been with it to be able to access the apartment how there are many who

2033
03:11:11.840 --> 03:11:17.800
have lived there in and out mm and then I had not much let take mm

2034
03:11:17.800 --> 03:11:23.000
and that you did not have key v what the means has the apartment been unlocked

2035
03:11:23.000 --> 03:11:29.279
Yes but then you know so Daniel has moved out of the apartment

2036
03:11:29.279 --> 03:11:32.279
Yes

2037
03:11:33.560 --> 03:11:40.560
ehm you get omb then to lend that apartment and then you pray to

2038
03:11:40.560 --> 03:11:44.840
The station and so you got questions and were confronted with information in I

2039
03:11:44.840 --> 03:11:49.840
the preliminary investigation into what you said said about that you remember what you said in

2040
03:11:49.840 --> 03:11:56.359
Your first interrogation question again did not understand you received

2041
03:11:56.359 --> 03:12:00.680
questions about why you have handled the tänan on it

2042
03:12:00.680 --> 03:12:07.640
ways that you do remember what you told you then yes that I am careful etc.

2043
03:12:07.640 --> 03:12:12.319
eh considering that the prosecutor read up and who has said later for I would

2044
03:12:12.319 --> 03:12:16.600
want to reproduce then if you don't remember exactly why picks up the tän so for

2045
03:12:16.600 --> 03:12:20.279
I am careful if I don't know people how do you mean I don't know what

2046
03:12:20.279 --> 03:12:23.720
my stuff ends up i'm just careful of myself because i live that life that

2047
03:12:23.720 --> 03:12:27.319
I do I don't know what lit harbor since I don't know the man I know

2048
03:12:27.319 --> 03:12:31.200

03:12:31.200 --> 03:12:36.399
have said so in the first hearing we'll see which side was it yes sorry I

2050
03:12:36.399 --> 03:12:42.520

2051
03:12:42.520 --> 03:12:46.239
initial short interrogation the first longer hearing held with Sandra

2052
03:12:46.239 --> 03:12:50.359
Pettersson wherever is there somewhere about the page is almost at the bottom

2053
03:12:50.359 --> 03:12:55.560
Page 554 This is the third question from the bottom why do you pick up the lighter so it

2054
03:12:55.560 --> 03:12:58.960
subsequent question how does mean

2055
03:13:00.800 --> 03:13:06.840

2057
03:13:20.880 --> 03:13:29.120
ehm about the money you eh describes food money etc. We see that the lighter is paid

2058
03:13:29.120 --> 03:13:36.640
with a 500 lamp yes eh as you remed it is the 500 patch of own money or is

2060
03:13:43.680 --> 03:13:49.080
Certainly hear a taxi driver later and I have seen information that the taxi ride should

2061
03:13:49.080 --> 03:13:55.080
have cost SEK 250 you have any idea of taxi ride cost yes

2062

2063
03:14:01.120 --> 03:14:05.600
you remember with cash yes and and be your own cash or cash no

2064
03:14:05.600 --> 03:14:10.880
it was as I would give it was the friend's intention that you got these

2065
03:14:10.880 --> 03:14:17.319
Money also so as not to pay the taxi yes and do you have any idea then

2070
03:14:58.600 --> 03:15:01.560
has been there for background or what the prosecutor is on there for a background

2071
03:15:01.560 --> 03:15:09.479
Yes did you have any knowledge of the criminal plans of others or whatever

2072
03:15:09.479 --> 03:15:15.880

heroin it was in September you said yes and I understood it as it was a bit

2098
03:17:41.640 --> 03:17:48.359
of a red line for you yes yes it is your view that Daniel is so deep in

2099
03:17:48.359 --> 03:17:52.640
the abuse that he starts with heroin then it is pretty bad yes it is not

2100
03:17:52.640 --> 03:17:56.640
would you say it is his main feature in normal cases yes in ordinary cases but

2101
03:17:56.640 --> 03:18:01.279
Not when we do with the item no so this was really a decline in

2102
03:18:01.279 --> 03:18:06.640
The abuse can be said so yes eh then the prosecutor has asked a lot of questions about it

2103
03:18:06.640 --> 03:18:11.399
Here the friend who both lending out your apartment yes but eh is not that you

03:18:15.199 --> 03:18:20.080
Daniel got involved without the only pure conclusions from my s yes speculation

2106
03:18:20.080 --> 03:18:25.080

Ask as you defense asked what was a little unclear answer it is about

2110
03:18:37.680 --> 03:18:43.000
that Daniel would have been in an apartment and been thrown out of neighbor M when time

2111
03:18:43.000 --> 03:18:48.840

The recording so we have input and then there is a hearing with Daniel

2119
03:19:27.080 --> 03:19:32.680
Pettersson here when Daniel then comes to the same way as for the others here

2120
03:19:32.680 --> 03:19:35.720
that you first have the opportunity to say something yourself first if you want

2121
03:19:35.720 --> 03:19:39.000
don't need it but you get that opportunity first and then you will

2122
03:19:39.000 --> 03:19:43.520
get questions from the prosecutor and perhaps from the target tree and eh then will

2123
03:19:43.520 --> 03:19:47.279
the defenders have the opportunity also your defender will have the opportunity first yes

2124
03:19:47.279 --> 03:19:52.000
But do you want to say something yourself first about what is said here yes

2125
03:19:52.000 --> 03:19:58.760
So what should I start

2126
03:19:58.760 --> 03:20:04.840
Eh i can start by wake up on a toilet prime crime

2127
03:20:04.840 --> 03:20:14.279
DSE Because I was I am, as I said, homeless and wake up reach toilet was

2129
03:20:19.520 --> 03:20:28.040

[Music] so

2132
03:20:38.319 --> 03:20:45.160
Yeah so I just should take the day of the day as well as do what you usually do when you

2133
03:20:45.160 --> 03:20:50.080
is because, as I said I am n i am an addict

2134
03:20:50.080 --> 03:20:55.359

2135

or Österplan is called S's yes mm just okay so that is why you go

2183
03:25:48.560 --> 03:25:53.520
cyclary there then so it is why you cycle right there then to yes that

2184
03:25:53.520 --> 03:25:58.439
So was it just cycled there that

2185
03:25:58.439 --> 03:26:04.960
was like my body just went so there so drove by itself etc. yes but

2186
03:26:04.960 --> 03:26:09.199
It is not that you chose the needle in another place so as not to wake up

2187
03:26:09.199 --> 03:26:17.080
much attention up no, for no no what did you have that can with

2188
03:26:17.080 --> 03:26:23.800
gasoline and so when it was on the east floor then was that can with gasoline as you

2189
03:26:23.800 --> 03:26:29.960
You bought at Södermalm's bag I have a bag on one bag is my home

2190
03:26:29.960 --> 03:26:34.439
Like then it is clothes and stuff so you have bags and stuff after all

2191
03:26:34.439 --> 03:26:39.279
when cycling around yes and is home yes so they are in the bag okay

2192
03:26:39.279 --> 03:26:45.800
Mm just that mm and how long did you take all this as i had no mobile

2193
03:26:45.800 --> 03:26:52.239
or clock so i don't know no yes when you bought on the east floor then what do you

2194
03:26:52.239 --> 03:26:56.840
then then v in other place yes just yes

2195
03:26:56.840 --> 03:27:01.520
cycled back up to Olof Palme where we met so we just shifted yes late

2196
03:27:01.520 --> 03:27:05.520
Went we ate whose hobb was he left there when you or was he there in place when

2197
03:27:05.520 --> 03:27:11.520
you got there or yes he was already there yes okay got it approved then what you bought

2198
03:27:11.520 --> 03:27:16.760
Was that where you would do yes I got the drugs so yes

2199
03:27:16.760 --> 03:27:20.560
Because it feels a bit neighbor as a coincidence how much ethanol you shop as looking

2200
03:27:20.560 --> 03:27:24.800
up bottle as i understand it va or have understood it wrong that you are forced to look

2201
03:27:24.800 --> 03:27:30.279
up mortgage bottles or bottle to the speech we must have something to pour out

2202
03:27:30.279 --> 03:27:39.399
Like yes it was then then I usually root for pledged money yes but was it

2203
03:27:39.399 --> 03:27:43.640
Just one and a half liters of zero you would buy it I don't really remember

2204
03:27:43.640 --> 03:27:51.479
It was just there so okay okay as I said I'm in

2205
03:27:51.479 --> 03:27:56.760
severe abuse during this period so it is very foggy mm it is

2206
03:27:56.760 --> 03:28:00.359
Almost so that I don't feel good either, it's almost like that I don't

2207
03:28:00.359 --> 03:28:08.160
want to live mm mm and when you get when you hand over then d gasoline and

2208
03:28:08.160 --> 03:28:13.239
The ethanol is it when you get yes we simply change then I jump on the bike and

2209
03:28:13.239 --> 03:28:17.520
just pulls to the nearest public toilet mm

2210
03:28:17.520 --> 03:28:24.880
m and how much money represents this drug approximately f yes what can

2211
03:28:24.880 --> 03:28:29.439
it be what was it 2 g about what could it be

2212
03:28:29.439 --> 03:28:38.239
400 400 approximately mm mm and this by getting SEK 400 approximately

2213
03:28:38.239 --> 03:28:44.479
is paid for shopping some gasoline and a little ethanol it feels like pretty good

2214
03:28:44.479 --> 03:28:49.399
Paid had ner no thing to put and the purpose of that

2215
03:28:49.399 --> 03:28:56.359
Well to get as much paid as 400 kral you got t gr the yes I got

2216
03:28:56.359 --> 03:29:01.720
no money no okay no but i'm a bit of a blow i use pay so you

2217
03:29:01.720 --> 03:29:07.160
Got drugs yes I call as payment yes yes but ok we say this

2218
03:29:07.160 --> 03:29:13.439
instead then to get such a large exchange for this service as drug value

2219
03:29:13.439 --> 03:29:20.160
about SEK 400 m refuel around it as well as it was felt strange or that

2220
03:29:20.160 --> 03:29:27.239
So it was no thought that I can feel good for a couple of hours

2221
03:29:27.239 --> 03:29:32.199
as well as you asked this person what the gasoline would be used for no that

2222
03:29:32.199 --> 03:29:37.000
Here so this was a completely random person as well as

2223
03:29:37.000 --> 03:29:44.239
I I don't know I didn't stand and shit chat with him so I just wanted to go fast

2224
03:29:44.239 --> 03:29:48.479
Okay but if if I have understood it right now all that you said and that is so

2225
03:29:48.479 --> 03:29:51.439
you said forewear too but if i have understood it right now then you might

2226
03:29:51.439 --> 03:29:55.399
not so much about what Nen is to be used for but it is important that you get it

2227
03:29:55.399 --> 03:30:01.239
drug no but then i don't know

2228
03:30:01.239 --> 03:30:08.560
what no no yes you did not ask what yes you did not ask h said you were no so

2229
03:30:08.560 --> 03:30:14.680
I was so in I had only one thing yes okay no but then we release you we have

2230
03:30:14.680 --> 03:30:22.239
found yours also has on a pair of gloves that Le Rus is wearing etc. you have

2231
03:30:22.239 --> 03:30:28.040
any knowledge of coming i know nothing about some gloves

2232
03:30:28.040 --> 03:30:32.560
No is it true that Sandra says that you have been in her position not become

2233
03:30:32.560 --> 03:30:37.760
Explained by one's neighbor Wanted is his name I think but I have not been where I

2234
03:30:37.760 --> 03:30:43.239
have been to Palme Torg and then I have gone and drugged since reach no I have

2235
03:30:43.239 --> 03:30:47.439
not been there no i have not had to reach contact with her at all

2236
03:30:47.439 --> 03:30:52.479
And you haven't been that kind of the day before or reach that either then no no no

2237
03:30:52.479 --> 03:30:57.720
Do you have any explanation how it turns out that gasoline ends up with Leon

2238
03:30:57.720 --> 03:31:04.720
and that gloves with your DNA end up with Leon No No No idea because I think

2239
03:31:04.720 --> 03:31:08.880
so then that since you have been married to Sandra so I think you have

2240
03:31:08.880 --> 03:31:11.880
somehow have contact with her

2241
03:31:11.880 --> 03:31:16.439
and I think like this that you somehow contact with Sandra

2242
03:31:16.439 --> 03:31:21.920
and make sure that gasoline and gloves come to Leon but that is not true then

2243
03:31:21.920 --> 03:31:27.600
So no no okay you recognize these

2244
03:31:27.600 --> 03:31:33.239
Gloves No I have never seen them before no

2245
03:31:33.239 --> 03:31:37.720

2250
03:31:56.680 --> 03:32:02.600

Yes the apartment and laundry room etc. then I see a guy who goes

2301
03:36:21.439 --> 03:36:27.880
outside the gate back and forth and eh he writes on the phone

2302
03:36:27.880 --> 03:36:34.000

2306
03:36:52.560 --> 03:36:57.040
But I went there were many times I saw anyway as I went ahead and

2307
03:36:57.040 --> 03:37:02.680
back many times mm so start to look a bit strange just that

2308
03:37:02.680 --> 03:37:11.359
it by viik etc. yes what what happened what happened since then eh shall we

2309
03:37:11.359 --> 03:37:17.960
See yes it was well when I was done with the laundry and by at ten o'clock

2310
03:37:17.960 --> 03:37:24.560
So then he wants to follow M into the gate yes and then it was locked so stood behind

2311
03:37:24.560 --> 03:37:29.520
me and then I looked at the look at him and

2312
03:37:29.520 --> 03:37:35.760
Then he said he would want to enter his grandmother or grandmother etc. and then released

2313
03:37:35.760 --> 03:37:43.560
i just in but it didn't feel so good then so yes i went leave the laundry and

2314

So I went out again and the wig was around the block mm and then

2315
03:37:48.040 --> 03:37:54.080
went back in and hold in the stairwell and then then put cigarette butts in the lock

2316
03:37:54.080 --> 03:38:01.479
on the door etc. and so it could not be locked ok so it stood down then yes exactly

2317
03:38:01.479 --> 03:38:05.720
Mm and then I went and then checked in the stairwell if he was left etc I thought

If one were to burglary in the wind or something like that there yes just

2319
03:38:11.160 --> 03:38:18.439

in the same direction he comes from towards Til Centrum

2435
03:49:27.439 --> 03:49:32.520
Eh but then me and my colleagues are so close then that we can grab him and

2436
03:49:32.520 --> 03:49:38.800
put him down on the ground eh then we drag him away quite far

2437
03:49:38.800 --> 03:49:45.439
In the parking lot directly there as we do not know what it is that has laid eh

2438
03:49:45.439 --> 03:49:52.680
on the ground or whatever in the local area mm eh and visit him for

2439
03:49:52.680 --> 03:49:57.159
to see if one has something dangerous or otherwise on of interest

2440
03:49:57.159 --> 03:50:03.399
eh we post his mobile eh letter him on the ground

2441
03:50:03.399 --> 03:50:12.800
eh and a moment after he has been arrested eh so the screen lights up there eh

2442
03:50:12.800 --> 03:50:17.800
and it looks like it is a message received in any form

2443
03:50:17.800 --> 03:50:23.840
of app and that you get a note about it eh from whom it was what it says and there

2444
03:50:23.840 --> 03:50:31.399
can i read that it stands dead all eh can't see the username or i

2445
03:50:31.399 --> 03:50:35.000
don't remember that anyway

2446
03:50:35.640 --> 03:50:43.319
eh so that's what happens etc. what does he do on the spot then

2447
03:50:43.319 --> 03:50:47.520
So we arrived come back to the bike do new tagel so what what

2448
03:50:47.520 --> 03:50:54.000
then undertakes for something no it is hard to see eh as it is so

2449
03:50:54.000 --> 03:51:01.479
pass dark where eh those street lights do not really reach there

2450
03:51:01.479 --> 03:51:07.279
It is like the darkest place in the courtyard if you say m eh but he travel

2451
03:51:07.279 --> 03:51:13.920
He is on and pick up with some eh eh letter in the bike he has the bike yes

2452
03:51:13.920 --> 03:51:18.720
In front of him you can say when I come against him and then he is squatting

2453
03:51:18.720 --> 03:51:23.760
eh and like yes I don't see what he does but the feeling is that he is on

2454
03:51:23.760 --> 03:51:29.279
something there when he's a squat eh so he gets up from there when i call to

2455
03:51:29.279 --> 03:51:35.239
it is a police officer then mm and the place he stood squatting then there was something of

2456
03:51:35.239 --> 03:51:41.080
interest where s when k checking yes just because late we should check what

2457
03:51:41.080 --> 03:51:46.239
it is as actually being laid there at the entrance eh and then when we go in via a

2458
03:51:46.239 --> 03:51:52.880
another apartment to be able to look at hold eh then we see that at the bike eh so

2459
03:51:52.880 --> 03:52:01.199
is there a gasoline can a glycol unclear content in them and then also

2460
03:52:01.199 --> 03:52:07.479
a pet bottle that we see is filled with some kind of yes half -clear liquid what I

2461
03:52:07.479 --> 03:52:13.800
can remember mm eh unclear content it is with but we then suspect that it is

2462
03:52:13.800 --> 03:52:21.439
somewhat flammable or explosive etc. mainly flammable as mm was based

2463
03:52:21.439 --> 03:52:25.239
the circumstances of the scene now came those objects have been there already when

2464
03:52:25.239 --> 03:52:29.479
the parked bike or how do you look at it

2465
03:52:29.479 --> 03:52:34.760
thing eh no that they

2466
03:52:34.760 --> 03:52:41.800
Eh that we had seen we had I had been there for a good while and look there

2467
03:52:41.800 --> 03:52:47.600
eh so I would say that and we had also moved in the area so it had

2468
03:52:47.600 --> 03:52:54.680
stood a yes one than a pet bottle I could very well have missed but not

2469
03:52:54.680 --> 03:53:03.640
the red dunken no it had I seen etc. you have any idea how

2470
03:53:03.640 --> 03:53:07.279
long time it takes roughly from the time he comes to the place from that it

2471
03:53:07.279 --> 03:53:14.560
decides to intervene eh yes it goes pretty fast eh

2472
03:53:14.560 --> 03:53:19.040
comes cycling there and turns pretty straight away then everything happens in a

2473
03:53:19.040 --> 03:53:25.600
dense foals so from seeing him come cycling to

2474
03:53:25.600 --> 03:53:33.600
that he is actually arrested so one and a half minutes about maybe mm it goes

2475
03:53:33.600 --> 03:53:38.640
fast how long had you been at the site approximately and observed or

2476
03:53:38.640 --> 03:53:42.040
scouted as it is called

2477
03:53:42.159 --> 03:53:48.680
So at that particular position, then M had against the same gate if you say so

2478
03:53:48.680 --> 03:53:53.479
it v made yes just that yes but it had

2479
03:53:53.479 --> 03:54:00.800
were a few hours anyway etc. there would have been more people who heard in or

2480
03:54:00.800 --> 03:54:06.960
Had there been any somin except the gate time you stood there

2481
03:54:07.600 --> 03:54:14.840
Eh i know there were people moving outside but never to ell

2482
03:54:14.840 --> 03:54:24.319
Port without the gates letters I want to remember etc. Okay and but I am etc. but gates

2483
03:54:24.319 --> 03:54:30.359
Blö did you say yes exactly mm What was it that made the decision to intervene against

2484
03:54:30.359 --> 03:54:36.359
This person then eh no but the behavior

2485
03:54:36.359 --> 03:54:45.840
eh both tien on the day and eh eh how he looks around even before he turned

2486
03:54:45.840 --> 03:54:52.520
eh made the gut feeling said it was interesting and then when he puts

2487
03:54:52.520 --> 03:54:58.319
themselves in yes in the darkest place but still near

2488
03:54:58.319 --> 03:55:05.680
number 28 where eh and put out some content in front of the entrance where it stands

2489
03:55:05.680 --> 03:55:12.000
well clear that we have to check reach MM a rather hypothetical question but you can

2490
03:55:12.000 --> 03:55:16.680
do the best yet I thought like this if there was any person who did not

2491
03:55:16.680 --> 03:55:21.399
shown a suspicious behavior that had, like, had gone towards the gate and entered there

2492
03:55:21.399 --> 03:55:27.439
Had that person also been checked you believe

2493
03:55:28.319 --> 03:55:35.880
Eh yes it will be very difficult and the threshing to check someone was

2494
03:55:35.880 --> 03:55:43.800
very low in this situation eh so eh

2495
03:55:44.760 --> 03:55:53.680
Yes it is, after all, it is difficult to say eh mm it is, after all it had come

2496
03:55:53.680 --> 03:56:00.520
Like yes no it is almost almost not possible and say risk I would

2497
03:56:00.520 --> 03:56:05.960
say the probability is very high that eh yes the first to come to

2498
03:56:05.960 --> 03:56:12.960
the gate current night and above all so late had been checked mm just

2499
03:56:12.960 --> 03:56:17.239
it ehm you had some tags to the gate

2500
03:56:17.239 --> 03:56:22.560
or reaching ways to get into this port number 28 eh I had it in

2501
03:56:22.560 --> 03:56:28.920
Any case no I understand how long was it thought you would stay

2502
03:56:28.920 --> 03:56:33.359
left about then on the spot it was like all night or was it

2503
03:56:33.359 --> 03:56:40.279
Mm yes v what i know we had no eh

2504
03:56:40.359 --> 03:56:47.760
eh restriction set or end time no it was good no but then exactly that i

2505
03:56:47.760 --> 03:56:53.479
thought about what has been spoken a little bit about fimples and dishes and the like so

2506
03:56:53.479 --> 03:56:56.840
The question is is there any one has been any person who has stood and smoked there

2507
03:56:56.840 --> 03:57:02.239
As you have seen eh not as I have seen no no and it

2508
03:57:02.239 --> 03:57:07.600
Here the person arrested have you seen any signs that he would have smoked or

2509
03:57:07.600 --> 03:57:11.560
handled cigarettes in some way

2510
03:57:12.000 --> 03:57:17.399
Eh yeah i know he i know he had liters on

2511
03:57:17.399 --> 03:57:25.640
Eh i can't remember now eh if he had cigarettes on but we

2512
03:57:25.640 --> 03:57:32.040
Wrote up eh eh what was found on him and

2513
03:57:32.040 --> 03:57:37.760
Things were also seized so it should be stated there etc. Yes but it does it he

2514
03:57:37.760 --> 03:57:43.359
did not smoke under yes while I observe him from the time he came

2515
03:57:43.359 --> 03:57:47.760
cycling until he was arrested so he didn't smoke anyway but liters I know

2516
03:57:47.760 --> 03:57:52.960
that he was wearing etc. yes but what good but then I'm done anyway then thanks

2526
03:58:35.239 --> 03:58:41.120
where what you usually usually do as a head not like this so put away there a little neighbor

2527
03:58:41.120 --> 03:58:45.199
As long as we get so that but prosecution will start to stand questions here m

2528
03:58:45.199 --> 03:58:49.399
well yes but thank you hello hi i have understood it as you work for

2529
03:58:49.399 --> 03:58:54.680
The social service as a social secretary is correct and this applies to the

2530
03:58:54.680 --> 03:59:01.800
October 7, 2023 yes eh I understand that you have worked then yes

2531
03:59:01.800 --> 03:59:06.359
Yes that is true we can tell you a little bit about what it was you would do and

2532
03:59:06.359 --> 03:59:11.600
what happened and possibly at a time so you did during this time eh we had

2533
03:59:11.600 --> 03:59:16.199
had talks with the police regarding yes but that it was a family that needs

2534
03:59:16.199 --> 03:59:21.439
protected that there was a threat so me and my colleague go out for

2535
03:59:21.439 --> 03:59:29.800
that yes but we shall protect a person eh we get okay by the police to go into

2536
03:59:29.800 --> 03:59:35.640
The area so we go in and stand in the parking lot that is quite close to where it

2537
03:59:35.640 --> 03:59:42.120
the person lives as we are going to pick up etc. when we sit in the car eh so we see

2538
03:59:42.120 --> 03:59:47.279
that there is a person outside the gate to the one where we are going to go in

2539
03:59:47.279 --> 03:59:53.199
eh so we wait to go out or go in there because we think yes it can

2540
03:59:53.199 --> 03:59:56.640
be who is standing where there is no need to be something but on the basis that we

2541
03:59:56.640 --> 03:59:59.920
knew it was ongoing threats so we thought we'll take it safe for

2542
03:59:59.920 --> 04:00:05.159
insecure and sitting left mm so we wait and it

2543
04:00:05.159 --> 04:00:11.279
maybe a quarter of the first direk taken what the way at about then I think

2544
04:00:11.279 --> 04:00:16.359
We roll into the area type at 22 something mm okay somewhere where give

2545
04:00:16.359 --> 04:00:20.279
and take yes no but eh and so wait okay so you wait 10 minutes quarter so

2546
04:00:20.279 --> 04:00:27.479
you yes but about mm eh and then so yes but the person stands yes but just not

2547
04:00:27.479 --> 04:00:31.479
in front of the gate without a bit on the side of as well as as

2548
04:00:31.479 --> 04:00:38.479
eh so we talk to a person in the house then eh and yes but first she says yes but

2549
04:00:38.479 --> 04:00:42.600
there maybe only a neighbor who is out smoking or something mm and we said but

2550
04:00:42.600 --> 04:00:49.319
We still await so until we know eh and then it will probably come

2551
04:00:49.319 --> 04:00:54.279
any other neighbor after a while and goes in and then this person joins into

2552
04:00:54.279 --> 04:01:01.199
the stairwell mm eh so yes but then we talk again with

2553
04:01:01.199 --> 04:01:05.359
the family that and like this await does not go out

2554
04:01:05.359 --> 04:01:12.880
eh and then so check yes but a person out of the keyhole and sees that it is not

2555
04:01:12.880 --> 04:01:19.399
some neighbor because they see the person going up and then goes down through to yes that

2556
04:01:19.399 --> 04:01:24.159
It comes up and we check for the gate where they live and then go down again

2557
04:01:24.159 --> 04:01:28.680
eh so me and my colleague after a while because then it goes down and there are some

2558
04:01:28.680 --> 04:01:33.040
minutes we think you might be someone who went in somewhere or yes mm so then

2559
04:01:33.040 --> 04:01:37.920
If we go out and then we pass as well as the gate just goes by and then

2560
04:01:37.920 --> 04:01:42.040
we turn and go back and then we see that there is a person as well as inside

2561
04:01:42.040 --> 04:01:47.760
The stairwell before dies as well as downstairs downstairs where it came in mm

2562
04:01:47.760 --> 04:01:54.080
Eh and yes but I think it's both we and mom call the police eh

2563
04:01:54.080 --> 04:02:01.880
based on situation etc. so yes so we go back and sit in the car and then

2564
04:02:01.880 --> 04:02:06.960
after a while so yes but will someone come and cycle past we do not think anymore

2565
04:02:06.960 --> 04:02:10.680
on it but we think we don't see if it comes from the house or not but that

2566
04:02:10.680 --> 04:02:16.399
bikes past a person yes eh and then so pole and check the stairwell and then it is

2567
04:02:16.399 --> 04:02:21.720
no one there exactly that yes when the person you observe then can

2568
04:02:21.720 --> 04:02:29.040
try to describe him to the seed yes but kind of normal length normal weight dark

2569
04:02:29.040 --> 04:02:34.120
pants either yes but dark jacket also either black or type dark blue

2570
04:02:34.120 --> 04:02:42.120
down jacket etc. dark shoes etc. This is where we see like yes age something like yes but

2571
04:02:42.120 --> 04:02:47.000
quite young around 20 years of age I guess mm mm mm hair color or something like that

2572
04:02:47.000 --> 04:02:50.920
can you observe so i don't think i see

2573
04:02:50.920 --> 04:02:54.760
The hair wonders if it is hood on or if it is but

2574
04:02:54.760 --> 04:02:59.960
mm spontaneous yes no I dare not really say it no but it is quiet you

2575
04:02:59.960 --> 04:03:05.439
eh just has his behavior in general is

2576
04:03:05.439 --> 04:03:09.120
that something that feels like feels like web or could it been

2577
04:03:09.120 --> 04:03:14.000
Anyone that but only that he stood in an inappropriate place right then

2578
04:03:14.000 --> 04:03:18.520
we experienced or I experienced like he was nervous it was like wandered

2579
04:03:18.520 --> 04:03:24.920
A little off and on and thus it felt like yes but nervous in the behavior etc.

2580
04:03:24.920 --> 04:03:32.040
Eh so M understands just that it said he followed someone reaching who lives there

2581
04:03:32.040 --> 04:03:36.439
inside the stairwell has any idea of how that person looked up it as

2582
04:03:36.439 --> 04:03:43.000
I said the one who lived in the house then no but long eh and kind of ward jacket on

2583
04:03:43.000 --> 04:03:49.279
or something with reflexes on just the dirty type yes but work pants something

2584
04:03:49.279 --> 04:03:55.439
such boots etc. mm just that

2585
04:03:55.880 --> 04:04:02.239
ehm just about when you see that guy in the tpp house you get any contact

2586
04:04:02.239 --> 04:04:08.040
or something then or no no no i don't know if he sees us like we

2587
04:04:08.040 --> 04:04:12.080
just walked by and then we turned and went back as well and saw that there was a

2588
04:04:12.080 --> 04:04:16.199
person there so then we thought we would not go in no exactly no but what should

2589
04:04:16.199 --> 04:04:20.439
When I get answers to my questions anyway etc. Thank you so much then Mother's Bet

2590
04:04:20.439 --> 04:04:25.000
Träde gets the opportunity yes thank you also some questions you eh you told you here

2591
04:04:25.000 --> 04:04:29.840
about the threat picture that you got it there was against the family and contacts only

2592
04:04:29.840 --> 04:04:34.640
Too clear debt who in the family is what you have contact with it is the mother in

2593
04:04:34.640 --> 04:04:39.640
The family that I have contact with the mother etc. and

2594
04:04:39.640 --> 04:04:46.600
You also told us here that eh eh it was a sequence where you see that

2595
04:04:46.600 --> 04:04:50.840
A neighbor goes in and that a person follows in and that you then talk to

2596
04:04:50.840 --> 04:04:57.040
The family again etc. eh tells the mother about it is the mother you talk to too m mm

2597
04:04:57.040 --> 04:05:01.800
she tells if she has made any observations or yes but she sees then

2598
04:05:01.800 --> 04:05:05.920
For first she thinks that maybe just a neighbor or someone standing

2599
04:05:05.920 --> 04:05:11.439
Outside and smoke eh but then she sees that yes but then when we call and say

2600
04:05:11.439 --> 04:05:16.840
That a person has entered so type, she checks out through the peephole and sees

2601
04:05:16.840 --> 04:05:21.560
that a person comes up on the floor where she lives and is there a

2602
04:05:21.560 --> 04:05:25.159
tag and then goes down again and she did not recognize the person who says it is

2603
04:05:25.159 --> 04:05:32.000
no neighbor and get worried that she will be worried then mm so she would call

2604
04:05:32.000 --> 04:05:38.479
Police etc. just for my next question is and it's really about it

2605
04:05:38.479 --> 04:05:43.640
first contact when you inform about the threat picture and then ongoing contact

2606
04:05:43.640 --> 04:05:48.239
evening you can describe a little how what is your impression how does mom react

2607
04:05:48.239 --> 04:05:50.920
here the information she receives from you under

2608
04:05:50.920 --> 04:05:58.199
Tonight no but at first she is not so worried before we get there but

2609
04:05:58.199 --> 04:06:03.279
yes agree that, as we should make sure that the smallest child becomes

2610
04:06:03.279 --> 04:06:09.840
protected but then when she sees the person in the stairwell and does not recognize it

2611
04:06:09.840 --> 04:06:16.680
that when she gets yes you are experienced becomes very worried mm eh so and on which

2612
04:06:16.680 --> 04:06:22.520
way it is noticeable that they become very worried no but more but upheld or

2613
04:06:22.520 --> 04:06:26.000
Like so, S feels that I don't recognize this person there is no one

2614
04:06:26.000 --> 04:06:30.800
neighbor and he just came up and watched and yes that it was nasty so she would

2615
04:06:30.800 --> 04:06:37.720
call the police directly etc. and eh then I wonder too have you had

2616
04:06:37.720 --> 04:06:42.399
any more contact with the mother or someone else in the family after this

2617
04:06:42.399 --> 04:06:45.399
The event

2618
04:06:46.040 --> 04:06:51.319
Yes we had a follow -up call the day

2619
04:06:51.640 --> 04:06:59.560
After who participated in the conversation it was me and mom who talked then etc.

2620
04:06:59.560 --> 04:07:04.720
eh just to, like yes but tune in to the way it became and that they are protected

2621
04:07:04.720 --> 04:07:12.000
everyone and how was her state of mind then no but stressed

2622
04:07:12.000 --> 04:07:19.880
or but like worried etc. she told me something about how they

2623
04:07:19.880 --> 04:07:26.479
The other families had reacted to what has happened to what they were aware

2624
04:07:26.479 --> 04:07:31.880
If no then I think we just talk about as well as her experience and

2625
04:07:31.880 --> 04:07:37.840
since the smallest child as you say the one we had contact around it was

2626
04:07:37.840 --> 04:07:44.560
the conversation revolved around MM and as well as to make sure they all had come

2627
04:07:44.560 --> 04:07:50.640
to another place protected as well as so mm for the whole family then yes as yes etc.

2628
04:07:50.640 --> 04:07:54.720
exactly we have had a statement that one has stayed away from

2629
04:07:54.720 --> 04:08:00.680
The home for a period eh is something you know about yes yes but

2630
04:08:00.680 --> 04:08:07.159
I know then and then at least that they no one was left in after yes then I know

2642
04:09:10.319 --> 04:09:15.880
first with your own words about what you see what happens on the spot then then maybe I have

2643
04:09:15.880 --> 04:09:19.319
any further supplementary question on this

2644
04:09:19.319 --> 04:09:30.000
Yes yes we were at the place where I and a colleague sat in a building at

2645
04:09:30.000 --> 04:09:35.239
The address kept supervision I don't remember exactly what time

2646
04:09:35.239 --> 04:09:40.560
were eh there were a little people in motion late

2647
04:09:40.560 --> 04:09:49.279
comes a person on a bicycle eh who then stays outside a gate that we

2648
04:09:49.279 --> 04:09:55.359
sitting and watching mm eh and what I remember was that it was one

2649
04:09:55.359 --> 04:09:59.960
bicycle basket on the bike eh bike was well dark bike basket was

2650
04:09:59.960 --> 04:10:05.680
well black if I don't remember the wrong prime.se eh something is in the bike basket I

2651
04:10:05.680 --> 04:10:11.840
can't see what is something red and it is one he has a plastic bag one

2652
04:10:11.840 --> 04:10:18.760
Want a bag on the board eh stands for a little while outside a gate

2653
04:10:18.760 --> 04:10:24.560
If I don't remember wrong goes a few meters away eh we don't see what

2654
04:10:24.560 --> 04:10:30.319
he's doing right there then he goes back in front of the gate he puts down something

2655
04:10:30.319 --> 04:10:34.479
which is not at the moment or then can see what it is

2656
04:10:34.479 --> 04:10:39.920
eh then he goes back to his bike that stands a few meters away under a tree

2657
04:10:39.920 --> 04:10:44.760
and starts to do something where he sits down crouches down and does

2658
04:10:44.760 --> 04:10:49.560
something where eh then my colleague runs out and

2659
04:10:49.560 --> 04:10:53.199
together with other colleagues who are there

2660
04:10:53.199 --> 04:11:00.239
Eh yes grabs this person and I stand in this building and look

2661
04:11:00.239 --> 04:11:06.600
All the time because we leave some equipment there so I can't leave

2662
04:11:07.920 --> 04:11:14.479
Mm that's probably what I remember by that particular event etc. Absolutely great it is

2663
04:11:14.479 --> 04:11:18.119
just a control question there so there is no misunderstanding there when you

2664
04:11:18.119 --> 04:11:21.640
says it sees something red in the bicycle basket and that it sees a bag on

2665
04:11:21.640 --> 04:11:28.279
The board we talk about by definition different objects as yes exactly the bike basket sits

2666
04:11:28.279 --> 04:11:32.600
after all on the board and there is something red in the bike basket and then is

2667
04:11:32.600 --> 04:11:37.080
it a white plastic bag then as it says Willis on if I don't miss m on as

2668

04:12:28.800 --> 04:12:32.239
applies to your observations then in connection with

2679
04:12:32.239 --> 04:12:39.840
The house search on Fjällvägen in Uddevalla on October 8, 2023 you know which

04:12:51.640 --> 04:12:56.399
be good but you can v tell yourself then first what yes but what happens

2683
04:12:56.399 --> 04:12:59.640
What observations are made for this occasion so maybe I put some

2684
04:12:59.640 --> 04:13:05.640
supplementary questions on it late yes thank you eh i together with colleague then make a

2685
04:13:05.640 --> 04:13:11.319
Husak on Fjällvägen 28E Eh and the apartment then at

2686
04:13:11.319 --> 04:13:17.960
the ground floor eh eh and even then in associated storage then on the same plane

2687
04:13:17.960 --> 04:13:26.319
Eh and this store is empty and there is a bathtub in I in this

2688
04:13:26.319 --> 04:13:33.439
the storage room but nothing else eh you are doing some kind of work

2689
04:13:33.439 --> 04:13:37.199
with ventilation drums in in itself

2690
04:13:37.199 --> 04:13:43.159
the apartment there so yes it looks a bit like a construction site to some extent in

2691
04:13:43.159 --> 04:13:47.279
and so on ehm and

2692
04:13:47.279 --> 04:13:54.080
eh yes we are in this one and always now we just this assignment we have

2693
04:13:54.080 --> 04:13:59.080
really no more knowledge that we will then make the house the case for

2694
04:13:59.080 --> 04:14:05.000
eh in Uddevalla we do not own the case but the Örebro case and we have very

2695
04:14:05.000 --> 04:14:10.279
scarce information in what has otherwise happened but we will do h.

2696
04:14:10.279 --> 04:14:17.000
at least mm ehm it is the apartment itself so it is

2697
04:14:17.000 --> 04:14:23.000
A little disorder in this apartment as there is some clothes holes and noise eh

2698
04:14:23.000 --> 04:14:30.119
There is a lot of disk there is a little flip boxes eh eh it says a big tvl

2699
04:14:30.119 --> 04:14:35.600
Åda in the apartment and no television but we get it later that it stands after all

2700
04:14:35.600 --> 04:14:41.680
Outside the apartment m When we do house things, we always lock the apartments

2701
04:14:41.680 --> 04:14:47.880
so that no one then comes in eh but all of a sudden a person comes into

2702
04:14:47.880 --> 04:14:57.239
the apartment and then with own key eh and we identify this person

2703
04:14:57.239 --> 04:15:04.399
eh no weirdness he behaves in a good and and pleasant way toward

2704
04:15:04.399 --> 04:15:09.760
us eh and his name is Leon then

2705
04:15:09.760 --> 04:15:16.920
Alfredsson he had no identification with him there without we do

2706
04:15:17.040 --> 04:15:20.040
Dataslayer

2707
04:15:25.450 --> 04:15:28.620
[Music]

2708
04:15:32.119 --> 04:15:39.159
Even a hearing with him that is documented on who sees dies then

2709
04:15:39.159 --> 04:15:45.040
ehm he then demonstrates that he has exhibited this TV for a one -camera

2710
04:15:45.040 --> 04:15:51.000
would pick up this TV later and it is then eh under a lake and that

2711
04:15:51.000 --> 04:15:57.359
is just outside in the stairwell and there is also a one bag and this one

2712
04:15:57.359 --> 04:16:03.399
The contents of the bag is, among other things, a black suit a white shirt a white tie

2713
04:16:03.399 --> 04:16:13.199
and there were some fine shoes there in size 41 Eh a confirmation Bible etc. and h

2714
04:16:13.199 --> 04:16:21.279
computer in a one computer bag eh then there was also some empty patrol sleeve there and that

2715
04:16:21.279 --> 04:16:29.040
Here, after all, EH is taken and we use Vilh Skar Le he would like to

2716
04:16:29.040 --> 04:16:32.800
look in this bag but he must not do it because he wonders if it was

2717
04:16:32.800 --> 04:16:41.439
something that belonged to him but but VSK can then seize it

2718
04:16:41.439 --> 04:16:49.800
eh to named eh we he knew that his friend then

2719
04:16:49.800 --> 04:16:57.439
Leon Kg Rik was arrested there and that information he had received from

2720
04:16:57.439 --> 04:17:02.960
Media and yes I thought it felt a little unclear why this one

2721
04:17:02.960 --> 04:17:08.760
the bag was packed with all belongings and why it was then

2722
04:17:08.760 --> 04:17:18.040
a one suit and a Bible and eh yes with white tie and a cartridge sleeve it was yes

2723
04:17:18.040 --> 04:17:24.800
A little unusual things I think eh then there were probably two mobile phones

2724
04:17:24.800 --> 04:17:30.199
there that was out some older model and some shaver but they cannot

2725
04:17:30.199 --> 04:17:35.319
say that I remember if it lay in that bag or if he wore them in

2726
04:17:35.319 --> 04:17:43.040
jacket or otherwise I don't know that but it was there was some kind

2727
04:17:43.040 --> 04:17:49.239
phone and so on we film this apartment and so there is well in i i

2728
04:17:49.239 --> 04:17:58.159
the case where eh I also have a hearing with

2729
04:17:58.159 --> 04:18:05.479
with Leon on site there and I don't really know about I will read

2730
04:18:05.479 --> 04:18:10.600
the interrogation or say because I think you have access to this

2731
04:18:10.600 --> 04:18:17.439
the interrogation eh where eh we have and you I thought about one

2732
04:18:17.439 --> 04:18:23.439
thing this bag now with the suit and confirmation Bible and you got any

2733
04:18:23.439 --> 04:18:29.119
information about like who would have packed this bag yes I took it

2734
04:18:29.119 --> 04:18:36.479
Like that it was Leon Alfredsson then who would have packed down some things

2735
04:18:36.479 --> 04:18:44.439
as which would then be eh eh good

2736
04:18:44.439 --> 04:18:52.159
eh for for eh to his friend then etc. so it was he who had exhibited it was

2737
04:18:52.159 --> 04:18:55.920
So as I perceived yes just that

2738
04:18:55.920 --> 04:19:01.159
ehm and the friend was it v who was it was it was located insered or where someone

2739
04:19:01.159 --> 04:19:06.000
other who was intended no no the buddy as he had

2740
04:19:06.000 --> 04:19:12.000
packed the bag and so was his clothes and so on in this one

2741
04:19:12.000 --> 04:19:19.680
The bag it was Leo he I call Leo Käg rustic then just that

2742
04:19:19.680 --> 04:19:22.680
just

2743
04:19:23.159 --> 04:19:28.840
ehm said something about why he now maybe we will not be on for but say

2744
04:19:28.840 --> 04:19:33.399
anything about why he has packed this bag then what the purpose

2745
04:19:33.399 --> 04:19:38.720
with yes eh eh I for me and wrote it

2746
04:19:38.720 --> 04:19:44.760
somewhere in either in the ear

2747
04:19:44.760 --> 04:19:55.199
eh or if it was in PMet where I can't pick it out of my memory there

2748
04:19:55.199 --> 04:20:00.800
But but out I think he said so in case it would happen to him something

2749
04:20:00.800 --> 04:20:05.359
prime.se yes I understand

2750
04:20:05.359 --> 04:20:10.840
eh heard right that it said he knew that something had happened too

2751
04:20:10.840 --> 04:20:19.760
With yes he had taken part in via media just that yes but it hard and so

2752
04:20:19.760 --> 04:20:24.680
had he figured out that it must be him because he then knew he had

2753
04:20:24.680 --> 04:20:28.680
went to Örebro just that yes but what good no but

2754
04:20:28.680 --> 04:20:32.640

2757
04:20:41.560 --> 04:20:47.159
Thanks Yes Hi Lawyer Charlotte Boklund Hello

2758
04:20:47.159 --> 04:20:52.840
Charlott I would just like to ask some questions if we've seen this

2759
04:20:52.840 --> 04:20:56.040
The hearing in

2760
04:20:56.720 --> 04:21:05.439
The preliminary investigation protocol 83 84 Eh he tells Leon Eh Alfredsson then

2761
04:21:05.439 --> 04:21:12.880
anything about any crime being committed or would be committed

2762
04:21:12.880 --> 04:21:21.720
In the actual hearing etc. but he he he said that yes I almost have to look in for

2763
04:21:21.720 --> 04:21:27.119
penny because i can't pick it out do you do it because it says there on page 83 yes

2764
04:21:27.119 --> 04:21:31.279
I don't have the page references in those eh because I don't have the preliminary investigation

2765
04:21:31.279 --> 04:21:37.800
in front of me there but yes but he says it thinks that witness should not look in

2766
04:21:37.800 --> 04:21:43.080
the hearing there without it without it you may try if you don't remember then you get

2767
04:21:43.080 --> 04:21:48.359
so try to put away pap there and is it that the lawyer may ask a question and

2768
04:21:48.359 --> 04:21:53.159
If you do not remember then the lawyer must consider whether to request to be read

2769
04:21:53.159 --> 04:21:58.560
up here eh but have i written then in the interview

2770
04:21:58.560 --> 04:22:03.760
So it was as he said in the interrogation etc.

2771
04:22:03.760 --> 04:22:12.880
Eh but what I remember it was that Leon Alfredsson in interrogation says that

2772
04:22:12.880 --> 04:22:20.720
he had been waiting to get some kind of assignment so he was like ready to

2773
04:22:20.720 --> 04:22:27.479
go to go where would he go you mean no sorry leon

2774
04:22:27.479 --> 04:22:33.479
Rustig had been waiting to get a mission eh and so he went to

2775
04:22:33.479 --> 04:22:38.880
Örebro yes so he he reports it and says that

2776
04:22:38.880 --> 04:22:45.319
Then sorry now I don't hear that reports it that he had received a

2777
04:22:45.319 --> 04:22:52.119
mission to commit a crime no not just no a mission

2778
04:22:52.119 --> 04:22:57.239
So I remember it was not to commit a crime just but he is waiting to get

2779
04:22:57.239 --> 04:22:59.880
go on

2780
04:23:00.000 --> 04:23:05.239
something yes and how did you interpret

2781
04:23:05.520 --> 04:23:11.640
it yes you can yes something then because it was

2782
04:23:11.640 --> 04:23:17.960
A crime time so no it is very difficult to and guess eh what young people

2783
04:23:17.960 --> 04:23:26.520
have for intentions with what they want g but you do not establish any notification of

2784
04:23:26.520 --> 04:23:33.000
that if I set up any notification no I have not done no

2785
04:23:33.000 --> 04:23:42.640
you are talking about something about you and Leon Alfsson and regarding this eh

2786
04:23:42.640 --> 04:23:45.560
The hearing should be

2787
04:23:45.720 --> 04:23:54.880
Secret no it is not that the hearing should be secret but but Leon Alfredsson

2788
04:23:54.880 --> 04:24:00.199
Don't want to stand for in interrogation who this one

2789
04:24:00.199 --> 04:24:07.520
the client is no, there is something mentioned about it

2790
04:24:07.520 --> 04:24:16.720
clients yes i leon he he is the pictures from an instagram account

2791
04:24:16.720 --> 04:24:28.399
eh on a guy who is then called the account is Hanko at Insta this guy will

2792
04:24:28.399 --> 04:24:34.680
hot hamsa and it should be this eh hamsa

2793
04:24:34.680 --> 04:24:42.640
then as who has given the mission itself it is something like Leon that

2794
04:24:42.640 --> 04:24:49.720
says my yes I show pictures and they have also attached

2795
04:24:49.720 --> 04:24:56.080
the investigation said something that it would be secret they

2796
04:24:56.080 --> 04:25:01.199
information yes he he did not want to stand for them in interrogation

2797
04:25:01.199 --> 04:25:06.439

2800
04:25:21.119 --> 04:25:26.920

2801
04:25:26.920 --> 04:25:30.560

2802
04:25:30.560 --> 04:25:35.600

Yeah had a man inside that tanks a gasoline can

2824
04:27:36.399 --> 04:27:45.800

do it is so long see it is hard to come

2826
04:27:49.800 --> 04:27:56.720
remember mm mm I understand but is there nothing that

2827
04:27:56.720 --> 04:28:02.119
you remember regarding where the purchase that stood out from as you thought of

2828
04:28:02.119 --> 04:28:06.920
then no, not directly

2829
04:28:06.920 --> 04:28:12.640
so no ok is something else you mine from

2830
04:28:12.640 --> 04:28:18.230
this purchase and as today thus

2831
04:28:18.230 --> 04:28:24.000
[Music] mm Yes I think he asked if I

2832
04:28:24.000 --> 04:28:30.840
had dunks mm eh but

2833
04:28:30.840 --> 04:28:39.840
eh eh so I don't remind if he bought or if he the idea of the can had

2834
04:28:39.840 --> 04:28:43.840
found okay

2835
04:28:44.239 --> 04:28:47.340
mins about it gord reach observations about by him before

2836
04:28:47.340 --> 04:28:51.560
[Music] he before remembers if you made any

2837
04:28:51.560 --> 04:28:55.840
observations of him before when he entered the store

2838
04:28:55.840 --> 04:28:58.840
eh

2839
04:29:01.000 --> 04:29:06.840
No, but he he thinks something anyway has asked for some dunk

2840
04:29:06.840 --> 04:29:13.359
Yes yes that's where I remember yes okay but you you have held a hearing with you

2841
04:29:13.359 --> 04:29:16.600
Given that you don't remember so much today so get okay with right so I thought

2842
04:29:16.600 --> 04:29:22.720
just double check on things there is on eh san 30 in the interrogation of an interrogation

2843
04:29:22.720 --> 04:29:30.720
As held on October 11 eh on Söder MPL just mm then you have received

2844
04:29:30.720 --> 04:29:36.080
tell me freely what you saw and experienced and then it was noted as he went

2845
04:29:36.080 --> 04:29:43.000
around looking in the trash can outside is something you remember today

2846
04:29:43.000 --> 04:29:50.720
No nothing i remember no then you come into the shop check around a bit pick on

2847
04:29:50.720 --> 04:29:54.680
paper and check at the mobile accessories there is something you

2848
04:29:54.680 --> 04:30:01.720
remember no he wanted an empty thump but I

2849
04:30:01.720 --> 04:30:07.560
said I can buy one that we have talked about this thunken prime crime dse yes yes

2850
04:30:07.560 --> 04:30:14.279
But that was the question of whether it was so I said so it was just that you give you

2851
04:30:14.279 --> 04:30:18.960
out dunkers if they ask for or is it so that you can buy it one

2852
04:30:18.960 --> 04:30:24.880
Instead, eh yes you can buy but sometimes it can stand empty cans

2853
04:30:24.880 --> 04:30:32.960
outside in the trash cans or so exactly that yes but I understand

2854
04:30:33.920 --> 04:30:40.920
ehm he asked if we had TMA cans on the layer glycol when found outside

2855
04:30:40.920 --> 04:30:45.760
The garbage can stand it s is something that sounds familiar

2856
04:30:45.760 --> 04:30:50.680
Mm yes it is difficult to remember it is so

2857
04:30:50.680 --> 04:30:57.040
long see and mm you have a lot of customers and mm so you have someone do you have any

2858
04:30:57.040 --> 04:31:04.359
Feeling for whether it deals with any more bottle or can than just the one that

2859
04:31:04.359 --> 04:31:08.520
you sell at the station

2860
04:31:08.520 --> 04:31:13.520
No no h

2861
04:31:13.520 --> 04:31:19.279
As it stands here I said he can buy empty cans and then he took

2862
04:31:19.279 --> 04:31:23.479
a f liter thunk and asked if one could bring

2863
04:31:31.670 --> 04:31:34.719
[Music]

2864
04:31:39.319 --> 04:31:43.760
glycol poisoned with the police where we can tune in a little neighbor did you tell

2865
04:31:43.760 --> 04:31:48.239
that you remembered then or is it something that you kept in with or that you laid

2866
04:31:48.239 --> 04:31:54.920
to as you remember no I had looked at

2867
04:31:54.920 --> 04:32:00.439
video movie mhm okay so d had you fished up the memory

2868
04:32:00.439 --> 04:32:06.520
before then before yes okay yes but then so and when did you see that movie and were

2869
04:32:06.520 --> 04:32:11.000
the same day you talked to the police or was it before at some time eh no

2870
04:32:11.000 --> 04:32:17.319
the same okay but then so this person now was something special about

2871
04:32:17.319 --> 04:32:24.640
him as otherwise his person who otherwise thought now that yes it looked at

2872
04:32:24.840 --> 04:32:30.439
memory no not what i can remember now no

2873
04:32:30.439 --> 04:32:36.359
No yes because then there is also recorded here in that company there then that I have difficulty

2874
04:32:36.359 --> 04:32:42.439
to put words into it but it was something I felt was scary with him

2875
04:32:42.439 --> 04:32:46.840
mm it can be true then yes so it is nothing I will

2876
04:32:46.840 --> 04:32:53.199
Remember now that I felt but was v a feeling then just that

2877
04:32:54.439 --> 04:32:58.560
ehm then so this is on I will not read so much but only

2878
04:32:58.560 --> 04:33:02.720
a little neighbor here I stood at the checkout and checked that he refueled and that he

2879
04:33:02.720 --> 04:33:07.561
Went from there people usually tell why you think up thumps for example to

2880
04:33:07.561 --> 04:33:11.959
they got a motor stop or similar I got feeling that he was not injured f that

2881
04:33:11.959 --> 04:33:17.879
fill up a car it was a bit more but that so it recorded it can be true

2882
04:33:17.879 --> 04:33:23.760
Lucky yes I don't know why I had that feeling it's hard to remember

2883
04:33:23.760 --> 04:33:31.480
Why I thought so no exactly yes because it says Kän also then only a foam

2884
04:33:31.480 --> 04:33:38.000
Feeling and I remembered he stuck out so it maybe a little there later

2885
04:33:38.000 --> 04:33:43.039
Have you been asked yes sorry then have asked if you have seen the man

2886
04:33:43.039 --> 04:33:49.760
Before, you remember what v you answer to that

2887
04:33:49.760 --> 04:33:55.719
No yes the answer was that you had not seen him before then one last thing here

2888
04:33:55.719 --> 04:33:59.119
Actually eh

2889
04:33:59.119 --> 04:34:03.879
ehm there is recorded here too since 31 where I got a feeling that it

2890
04:34:03.879 --> 04:34:10.160
possibly was affected by something I don't have very good control of drugs

2891
04:34:10.160 --> 04:34:15.600
m Yes no as I said I don't know I know

2892
04:34:15.600 --> 04:34:19.600
not how this person is in normal cases either so

2893
04:34:19.600 --> 04:34:27.160
No it is at least sorry yes no it no mm it is at least here now

2894
04:34:27.160 --> 04:34:32.600

2895
04:34:32.600 --> 04:34:37.080

2896
04:34:37.080 --> 04:34:46.760
that they yes v you will ih call before mm yes okay yes but then so then it is not

2897

I don't remember I can't sit here and g I don't remember you don't remember

2954
04:40:18.320 --> 04:40:22.920
That is calm but I but I think like this now when you talked to the police

2955
04:40:22.920 --> 04:40:28.400
Then October 17th you think you are better mines then than you do today what did you say

2956
04:40:28.400 --> 04:40:33.160
When you talked to the police here for what we f police interrogation and it was 17

2957
04:40:33.160 --> 04:40:40.040
October exactly yes did you take that you remembered better then than you do today it was

2958
04:40:40.040 --> 04:40:44.718
long ago because I don't really remember everything that has happened

2959
04:40:44.718 --> 04:40:49.160
for I have driven many people every time yes yes no but I understand no

2960
04:40:49.160 --> 04:40:55.718
But for now it is now it is April 26 today huh and we talked about an event

2961
04:40:55.718 --> 04:41:00.878
then as on October 7 It is quite a long time see back that I understand too

2962
04:41:00.878 --> 04:41:05.878
But this police interview it was then on October 17 it was a little closer in the time

2963
04:41:05.878 --> 04:41:10.958
So my question is like this when you have described this that she left behind

2964
04:41:10.958 --> 04:41:17.320
money to the guy do you think you remembered when the trip better then than you do

2965
04:41:17.320 --> 04:41:24.360
today eh i don't really remember no no okay no okay but if we say this way then

2966
04:41:24.360 --> 04:41:29.638
When you talk to the police M told you what you knew or found on something

2967
04:41:29.638 --> 04:41:33.798
do you think or did you tell me that as you knew I told me what has

2968
04:41:33.798 --> 04:41:43.280
Happened from in my car what has happened in my car to what is s seal yes I

2969
04:41:43.280 --> 04:41:46.680
don't know these people I don't know where they come from no I have

2970
04:41:46.680 --> 04:41:51.520
no one related to them has nothing with them no they have the being customer as if you

2971
04:41:51.520 --> 04:41:59.798
would jump into taxi the same thing for you yes no but okay no but i understand you

2972
04:42:01.878 --> 04:42:07.280
eh do you remember something else about these people there was something

2973
04:42:07.280 --> 04:42:12.040
As you thought was as which was worth putting on

2974
04:42:12.040 --> 04:42:18.600
Memory they were they were nice they were not so stingy such stuff no eh she

2975
04:42:18.600 --> 04:42:24.878
sat down she talked on the phone she had phone in hand etc. as i mins

2976
04:42:24.878 --> 04:42:31.760
Just that yes but this person sitting behind was quiet he was quiet I remember

2977
04:42:31.760 --> 04:42:36.680
It was you were you person I said marte nothing

2978
04:42:36.680 --> 04:42:41.600
No you remember anything about what she was talking about on the phone no I remember

2979
04:42:41.600 --> 04:42:47.440
not no because you have received a question too is it at late 33 and then it stood

2980
04:42:47.440 --> 04:42:53.360
So here she talked about something if someone had spun money I didn't hear that

2981
04:42:53.360 --> 04:43:00.040
a lot yes i didn't hear okay i talked on the phone she she said eh like me

2982
04:43:00.040 --> 04:43:05.160
mins something if someone had taken h money or she has taken h reach as I

2983
04:43:05.160 --> 04:43:12.520
don't really remember but if s okay yes just that and then you said you don't have that

2984
04:43:12.520 --> 04:43:17.320
Very check it was ordinary customers for you who paid and were not stuck but

2985
04:43:17.320 --> 04:43:22.040
Did you say you had been asked this way what did you get for the feeling of the people and then

2986
04:43:22.040 --> 04:43:26.240
have you described like this as the police recorded what I got the feeling that

2987
04:43:26.240 --> 04:43:30.920
The woman was doing drugs I can be wrong but it was my feeling the guy was

2988
04:43:30.920 --> 04:43:38.360
quiet and just sat behind what do you think around it yes because it smells cigarette on

2989
04:43:38.360 --> 04:43:42.760
her yeah yeah ok it was what made you

2990
04:43:42.760 --> 04:43:46.958
thought it was the dog yes I thought it is something it is not like usual

2991
04:43:46.958 --> 04:43:54.840
person you see on the street always okay it was just that okay yes I understand

2992
04:43:54.840 --> 04:44:01.440
But the most important thing here that I ENT wanted to know it was, above all, to with

2993
04:44:01.440 --> 04:44:06.160
If h leave any money but it didn't remember then if you had done no

2994
04:44:06.160 --> 04:44:11.360
I am going to be honest i remind not no no but okay it understands you can be then

2995

2997
04:44:24.240 --> 04:44:29.240
well eh hello Björn Andersson lawyer I just wanted to ask you off with full

2998
04:44:29.240 --> 04:44:32.520
respect that there has been some time eh that it may not be easy to come

2999
04:44:32.520 --> 04:44:39.320
Remember what the taxi ride was paid the woman for Taxiresan USFF that it was

3000
04:44:39.320 --> 04:44:43.760
250 I think just right and then I ask an even more difficult question will

3001
04:44:43.760 --> 04:44:47.360
you remember which denominations she pays with what so you can remember which denominations

3002
04:44:47.360 --> 04:44:53.600
she paid by what do you mean by you can pay SEK 250 in different ways edge we

3003
04:44:53.600 --> 04:44:59.360
spoke 200 200 and then 50 kpp yes almost in

3004
04:44:59.360 --> 04:45:04.320
The hearing on page 303 you get asked how paid the woman

3005
04:45:04.320 --> 04:45:11.120
And the guy for the trip then it is in cash I got 100 100 20 20 SEK yes

3006
04:45:11.120 --> 04:45:16.798
I think I don't really remember yes it can be so 100 dogs yes because she

3007
04:45:16.798 --> 04:45:21.080
asked Afta gear yes I remember now yes she asked decrease gear I had gear

3008
04:45:21.080 --> 04:45:25.958
Yes but good it is fully understandable yes remember eh when you meet these

3009
04:45:25.958 --> 04:45:32.798
the people at the central and they and they eh book the trip or explain where they

3010
04:45:32.798 --> 04:45:37.240
Should you say you should go toward Duble, you remember what the woman says about she

3011
04:45:37.240 --> 04:45:43.160
leaving any address or similar no they did not book taxi it came from

3012
04:45:43.160 --> 04:45:47.798
Press agency kept eh and since we stood we i don't know if you've been to the central

3013
04:45:47.798 --> 04:45:51.480
It stood like taxis and since I was the farthest away

3014
04:45:51.480 --> 04:45:57.638
last k just but to you the woman said any address or similar no they said

3015
04:45:57.638 --> 04:46:02.798
How they expressed eh first they said in Til and then changed the ones I think I

3016
04:46:02.798 --> 04:46:08.360
think maybe they don't recognize how Örebro is eh as soon as we arrived at

3017
04:46:08.360 --> 04:46:13.958
The petrol station where they saw eh said they can you can you stay over there

3018
04:46:13.958 --> 04:46:19.440
Just that I had to stay then when you don't fully remember I would like to read

3019
04:46:19.440 --> 04:46:24.320
what you say at the bottom of page 32 it's almost the last line before one one

3020
04:46:24.320 --> 04:46:28.718
Ask coming there then it says like this she said something with helmets but I

3021
04:46:28.718 --> 04:46:33.718
Don't remember exactly no number she said then she changes to Circle K yes it

3022
04:46:33.718 --> 04:46:39.680
are helmets, of course we get exactly the helmets the way this one goes up just

3023
04:46:39.680 --> 04:46:43.920
It yes so it was there may have been that she has mentioned helmets or helmets

3024
04:46:43.920 --> 04:46:52.840
the road or something so i good they are two in the car they talk to each other no like me

3025
04:46:52.840 --> 04:47:00.160
said she talked on the phone yes eh the other person sat back was quiet just yes you

3026
04:47:00.160 --> 04:47:05.400
Don't hear anything talking to each other during the trip no no yes thank you it was mine

3027
04:47:05.400 --> 04:47:12.520
questions etc. Thank you so much then before end we turn off recording

3028
04:47:12.638 --> 04:47:15.958
We do this even now and then the recording was up and then is

3029
04:47:15.958 --> 04:47:19.680
the witness's foreweck with Morgan Boje and it is the prosecutor who sits here who has Bärt

3030
04:47:19.680 --> 04:47:23.480
That you will be interrogated so he will start asking questions and then will

3031
04:47:23.480 --> 04:47:28.360
goals enter and all the defenders here in turn are given the opportunity to set

3032
04:47:28.360 --> 04:47:33.440
Questions but go may start please thank you hello eh you should be heard about two things

3033
04:47:33.440 --> 04:47:37.440
Actually the first is about the observation on Tulegatan 28 then so

3034
04:47:37.440 --> 04:47:42.520
it is also about the arrest of Hamads Vanan then as S to PM about but if we

3035
04:47:42.520 --> 04:47:47.400
Starting with in TNA on Tat 28 so I would like you to tell yourself what you

3036
04:47:47.400 --> 04:47:53.160
do there and what you see at the site eh I work as an intervention scout

3037
04:47:53.160 --> 04:47:59.240
thus fully civilly dressed but also intervenes as intervention police eh in our

3038
04:47:59.240 --> 04:48:03.840
service we work primarily against serious violent crimes and drug offenses in

3039
04:48:03.840 --> 04:48:10.280
the foundation the assignment we received was that a family or address could be risky

3040
04:48:10.280 --> 04:48:15.840
for any kind of act of violence I did not know exactly what they could become

3041
04:48:15.840 --> 04:48:20.878
exposed to but they had some kind of threat picture of themselves

3042
04:48:20.878 --> 04:48:24.760
Eh i together with my colleagues [music]

3043
04:48:24.760 --> 04:48:32.638
eh simply watches this address hidden eh i have information to eh look

3044
04:48:32.638 --> 04:48:37.920
At the entrance Tylegatan now I do not remember exactly the current one

3045
04:48:37.920 --> 04:48:44.878
the address if it is 28an or 30 trvis 2 28 yes eh i have at least the task to

3046
04:48:44.878 --> 04:48:54.360
keep track of that gate eh and we an occasion then a man comes on a bike

3047
04:48:54.360 --> 04:49:02.520
eh he parks the bike between 28 and 30 Eh and goes straight in then to the current card

3048
04:49:02.520 --> 04:49:08.760
eh number 28 then eh and exactly he just goes straight in and like he should

3049
04:49:08.760 --> 04:49:13.040
go straight into the entrance eh but he starts jerking in the door and then realizes that it is

3050
04:49:13.040 --> 04:49:19.400
locked eh just there we react because eh you live there or are visiting so should

3051
04:49:19.400 --> 04:49:27.840
man v know them if it eh is unlocked eh this man is then between

3052
04:49:27.840 --> 04:49:35.600
Gate 28 and 30 for a long time frequently he stands and eh pills with his

3053
04:49:35.600 --> 04:49:43.000
phone and smoke eh yes you feel nervous he rarely stands he goes

3054
04:49:43.000 --> 04:49:48.638
back and forth and eh yes but we react to him

3055
04:49:48.638 --> 04:49:57.040
eh then on one occasion when he stands the poet's gate at 28an eh or very

3056
04:49:57.040 --> 04:50:03.760
Close to connection, there will be two Soss secretaries later but at this stage

3057
04:50:03.760 --> 04:50:08.558
do we only see two women to go to this gate so they go toward 28an and

3058
04:50:08.558 --> 04:50:12.718
Then when they see this man so they turn o and go away a few hundred

3059
04:50:12.718 --> 04:50:17.400
meters and we didn't really understand what happened there but in conjunction with it

3060
04:50:17.400 --> 04:50:23.480
calls in to 112 a call from the social services that two women have thought

3061
04:50:23.480 --> 04:50:28.558
go into the gate but they thought this man felt uncomfortable mm

3062
04:50:28.558 --> 04:50:33.878
eh so it confirmed like our feeling that this man behaves

3063
04:50:33.878 --> 04:50:37.120
differently on the spot

3064
04:50:37.520 --> 04:50:43.798
eh the women go from there without and go into the gate man

3065
04:50:43.798 --> 04:50:48.240
continues to stay out of the gate and in conjunction with this during the evening has

3066
04:50:48.240 --> 04:50:53.320
We also seen a guy with a warning jacket who goes in and out of the gate eh several

3067
04:50:53.320 --> 04:50:58.558
times eh will mika throw and in and out and when we we judged him as a

3068
04:50:58.558 --> 04:51:03.760
accommodation at at the address and on one occasion then this guy comes

3069
04:51:03.760 --> 04:51:09.040
With with warning jacket eh and then start talking to this one

3070
04:51:09.040 --> 04:51:14.200
the man standing outside eh we don't know what was said between

3071
04:51:14.200 --> 04:51:20.000
But they only exchanged a few words and then the notice of the eh lined man in

3072
04:51:20.000 --> 04:51:24.718
the gate and this unknown guy go after into the gate

3073
04:51:24.718 --> 04:51:29.400
eh so we interpreted as he was talking to him and asks if he could hang

3074
04:51:29.400 --> 04:51:36.520
me in simply m then takes about 10o minutes eh I want to remember eh and

3075
04:51:36.520 --> 04:51:42.558
Then this guy comes out again eh and he sits on his bike and ride

3076
04:51:42.558 --> 04:51:48.160
from the place you before leaving this one

3077
04:51:48.160 --> 04:51:53.920
The sequence you have to find out about how we this bike is locked or

3078
04:51:53.920 --> 04:51:59.600
unlocked it so safely in pm if i have seen that observation or not eh it

3079
04:51:59.600 --> 04:52:05.120
stands in PMet the second last paragraph San 38 here yes

3080
04:52:05.120 --> 04:52:09.638
that okay so you just fish the witness his memory here as he goes out from Aden locks

3081
04:52:09.638 --> 04:52:15.520
up the bike and Å from the site went up to the university hall then it is good

3082
04:52:15.520 --> 04:52:20.638
I have written the PM to direct connection so I can refer to it

3083
04:52:20.638 --> 04:52:27.558
Eh he cycles from there eh we get assignments from those who own

3084
04:52:27.558 --> 04:52:32.360
the effort that we should not control him so he disappears to unknown

3085
04:52:32.360 --> 04:52:38.798
place then the hours go during the night and really nothing else is observed as

3086
04:52:38.798 --> 04:52:44.558
have with the case to do eh i'm just going to get off my pass eh

3087
04:52:44.558 --> 04:52:50.878
and other colleagues will take on and exactly when we have largely

3088
04:52:50.878 --> 04:52:56.558
landed, I hear the effort that it becomes an intervention by a person

3089
04:52:56.558 --> 04:53:02.558
Just that and then in a chat that we have, the gripping photos are placed directly on

3090
04:53:02.558 --> 04:53:08.878
This arrested man and I shake to directly that it is identical upholstery

3091
04:53:08.878 --> 04:53:15.400
eh and body constitution size eh and so on the man we

3092
04:53:15.400 --> 04:53:20.798
have observed eh eh so i my spontaneous feeling was that yes he must have been there

3093
04:53:20.798 --> 04:53:25.798
To raise simply that was how we judged you saw when there was any picture

3094
04:53:25.798 --> 04:53:31.520
on the bike also yes exactly and the same with the bike was a dark d bike I want to

3095
04:53:31.520 --> 04:53:35.760
Remember that was well in line with the one we had seen okay yes but great

3096
04:53:35.760 --> 04:53:44.160
Eh that was probably what I had in that part it was good eh since then should only

3097
04:53:44.160 --> 04:53:49.760
change pm here eh so have you been involved as I

3098
04:53:49.760 --> 04:53:55.718
understood it in the arrest of Ham's al side out in Bengtsfors that is true

3099
04:53:55.718 --> 04:54:00.320
is right eh then i would like to know a little neighbor how the inland is included and

3100
04:54:00.320 --> 04:54:06.120
What I am particularly interested in is like how mobile phone is handled etc. EH

3101
04:54:06.120 --> 04:54:14.160
We get assignments there that Hamsa should be arrested EH as suspected in this case eh

3102
04:54:14.160 --> 04:54:19.558
I probably didn't know exactly participation there and then and eh in these cases get

3103
04:54:19.558 --> 04:54:23.558
We often to it is very important with the information found

3104
04:54:23.558 --> 04:54:28.040
in the phone they use encrypted chats so that it is usually eh

3105
04:54:28.040 --> 04:54:33.040
aggravating to eh take us into the encrypted chats and one one

3106
04:54:33.040 --> 04:54:38.440
success factor in the fact that the phone is unlocked mm eh at the arrest so we got

3107
04:54:38.440 --> 04:54:43.600
that directive if he can be arrested with an open phone then it is good

3108
04:54:43.600 --> 04:54:51.920
EH Hamsa leaves his home address current day along with a

3109
04:54:51.920 --> 04:54:58.520
as we judged friend or a man and they start jogging down toward a bus stop in

3110
04:54:58.520 --> 04:55:04.878
Close connection to the home address eh my two colleagues

3111
04:55:04.878 --> 04:55:10.958
eh stops eh hamsa eh identifies as a police officer

3112
04:55:10.958 --> 04:55:14.718
and eh in conjunction with that I see that he

3113
04:55:14.718 --> 04:55:18.760
holding the phone in hand so I take it away from him because there is a decision about

3114
04:55:18.760 --> 04:55:25.200
that it should seize mm Eh so I take the phone sand with it identifying

3115
04:55:25.200 --> 04:55:32.280
themselves as police officers and eh we keep him eh it will be very like a multi -art

3116
04:55:32.280 --> 04:55:38.040
As soon as we take the phone and they grab him so he sits to

3117
04:55:38.040 --> 04:55:43.920
Physically counter -defense simply eh I exhibit the phone I see that

3118
04:55:43.920 --> 04:55:50.680
It is Face ID thus one it is unlocked with with face recognition

3119
04:55:50.680 --> 04:55:54.760
eh so i show off the phone to him and ask if it is his phone he

3120
04:55:54.760 --> 04:55:58.680
says yes it is my phone and then he immediately realizes that the phone is holding

3121
04:55:58.680 --> 04:56:03.360
on and unlocked which makes him close and grimace the face and

3122
04:56:03.360 --> 04:56:09.240
turning down the head and pushing down the face into its hood or its hood jacket

3123
04:56:09.240 --> 04:56:14.440
eh eh it was very very clear that he realized that he himself was that

3124
04:56:14.440 --> 04:56:19.680
unlock the phone with the recognition of the face etc. eh and then he does everything in

3125
04:56:19.680 --> 04:56:26.638
its power to eh eh not we should be able to unlock it with with that method etc. so

3126
04:56:26.638 --> 04:56:30.520
It was clear that it was sensitive

3127
04:56:30.520 --> 04:56:35.638
eh starts screaming clove words and we will never get into that one

3128
04:56:35.638 --> 04:56:39.400
the phone and and so there he says the end that it's not even my phone

3129
04:56:39.400 --> 04:56:46.798
And so there even though he initially said he yes to mm just

3130
04:56:47.920 --> 04:56:53.200
It is just that yes no but that's what I wanted answers to anyway thanks

3131
04:56:53.200 --> 04:56:56.120
Thank you so much then I will go to the opportunity here here please no thanks I have

3132
04:56:56.120 --> 04:57:02.760
no questions lawyer larsson no thanks lawyer eh eaten i can set someone

3133
04:57:02.760 --> 04:57:08.240
Ask Hi Hi Eh Don't know if you also work as an investigator holding police interrogation

3134
04:57:08.240 --> 04:57:14.320
and so there too okay but what is your view then eh people who are arrested

3135
04:57:14.320 --> 04:57:20.600
In general, they usually want the police to check through the phone or

3136
04:57:20.600 --> 04:57:26.920
Eh between us absolutely would you agree that most of most people did not want to

3137
04:57:26.920 --> 04:57:31.080
That they look at the phone most often so it can usually be a discussion

3138
04:57:31.080 --> 04:57:33.320
Why do you want to get into my phone and

3139
04:57:33.320 --> 04:57:39.440
eh no i have sensitive pictures there or yes here it was on in a second decision

3140
04:57:39.440 --> 04:57:45.040
so it really was struggle for life not to unlock the phone m it I

3141
04:57:45.040 --> 04:57:49.080
understands is that he he really just closed because then you can't access

3142
04:57:49.080 --> 04:57:53.120
Face recognition yes close your eyes and pushes the face into

3143
04:57:53.120 --> 04:57:58.638
his own jacket and then pushes his head toward their own knees before he

3144
04:57:58.638 --> 04:58:05.558
sitting in bus place just that okay no no more superficial thanks mm nice booklund no

3148
04:58:24.600 --> 04:58:30.240

3149
04:58:30.240 --> 04:58:33.718
take that one could have a credit card or something that thought before that

3150
