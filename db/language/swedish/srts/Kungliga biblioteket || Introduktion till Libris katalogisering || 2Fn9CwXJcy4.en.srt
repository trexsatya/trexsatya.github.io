1
00:00:07,940 --> 00:00:12,800
In this movie we will take a tour of Libris cataloging tools.

2
00:00:13,040 --> 00:00:19,840
We will go through the home page, the main menu, the tool menu and the structure in a description.

3
00:00:20,100 --> 00:00:24,860
Libris cataloging is the name of the cataloging tool.

4
00:00:25,040 --> 00:00:28,880
Libris cataloging is part of Libris XL

5
00:00:29,040 --> 00:00:35,200
which is the name of Libri's new technical infrastructure and was launched in 2018.

6
00:00:35,660 --> 00:00:38,660
Libris cataloging is a web tool.

7
00:00:38,900 --> 00:00:44,100
It works in all browsers but has proven to work best in Google Chrome.

8
00:00:44,300 --> 00:00:49,300
When learning Libris cataloging, use a test environment

9
00:00:49,480 --> 00:00:54,100
And you see the address of the test environment in the address window.

10
00:00:54,520 --> 00:00:59,200
The test environment contains a copy of the libris database.

11
00:00:59,460 --> 00:01:02,580
Here you can freely practice cataloging.

12
00:01:02,780 --> 00:01:08,000
What you save here will be cleared away at the next update of the test environment.

13
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:13,660
You will receive login information to the test environment at the basic course.

14
00:01:14,520 --> 00:01:20,420
When you are logged in, you can see in the upper right corner which sigel you have active.

15
00:01:20,680 --> 00:01:24,560
Sigel is a code designation for a library.

16
00:01:24,700 --> 00:01:29,800
If you have access to multiple Sigler, you can change here if necessary.

17
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:34,360
We will look at the home page.

18
00:01:35,340 --> 00:01:42,340
Here you will find links to news, introductory material and to Libris Supportforum.

19
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:47,820
You will find our instructional films found in a playlist on Youtube.

20
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:51,360
At the top of the page is a main menu.

21
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:57,200
Here are search that leads to search in libris and search in other sources.

22
00:01:57,620 --> 00:02:03,200
It is important to seek carefully before creating something new so as not to create duplicates.

23
00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:06,780
We will take a closer look at search in another movie.

24
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:12,100
The heading Create new leads to a page with templates for different material types.

25
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:15,940
Keep in mind that you very rarely need to create something new.

26
00:02:16,180 --> 00:02:22,940
There is usually already an item or pre -information in Libris for what you should describe.

27
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:26,160
The next heading is catalog care.

28
00:02:26,420 --> 00:02:30,420
Here you will find a feature for moving stocks between items.

29
00:02:31,020 --> 00:02:33,780
Then we get helpful.

30
00:02:34,300 --> 00:02:38,660
Through the helping heading you come to a page with help texts.

31
00:02:38,900 --> 00:02:43,480
This page can be used in parallel with the cataloging tool.

32
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:49,420
Feel free to open it in a new tab and go to the help when you wonder about something.

33
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:54,200
We will look at the headlines in the help.

34
00:02:55,260 --> 00:03:00,980
You will find, in the middle of the page, a list of links to further information.

35
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:07,720
Among other things, the important instructions for cataloging according to RDA, which are our catalog rules.

36
00:03:07,960 --> 00:03:15,600
During the cataloging tool in the left menu there are some pages that explain how the tool works.

37
00:03:15,960 --> 00:03:21,760
The page to use the tool contains many headings that you benefit from.

38
00:03:22,380 --> 00:03:27,860
There is a list of shortcuts for PC and Mac.

39
00:03:28,420 --> 00:03:35,380
Under general description there are help texts that are common to several types of materials.

40
00:03:35,660 --> 00:03:41,560
Admin metadata is administrative metadata found in each entry.

41
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:47,320
The headings work and instance you recognize from previous films.

42
00:03:47,660 --> 00:03:56,880
Under works you will find headings such as participation and function, genre/form, classification and subject.

43
00:03:57,120 --> 00:04:02,560
These are characteristics that are common to several editions of a work.

44
00:04:02,860 --> 00:04:13,800
During the instance there are headings such as publishing, identifier, such as ISBN, scope, dimensions.

45
00:04:14,220 --> 00:04:17,220
This is what is specific to the edition.

46
00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:22,720
Then we see in the left menu that there are pages for different material types.

47
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:29,860
There are pages about agents and subject words, stocks, terminology

48
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:34,600
And you will find the page with educational material here.

49
00:04:34,780 --> 00:04:42,480
We go back to the home page.
 We will take a closer look at an entry and see what it looks like in the tool.

50
00:04:42,680 --> 00:04:46,400
I'm looking for a title, sheet metal food.

51
00:04:48,640 --> 00:04:52,640
And choose a printed monograph here in the list.

52
00:04:52,940 --> 00:04:56,400
This is a vegetarian cookbook.

53
00:04:56,620 --> 00:05:01,660
There is a box that summarizes the information in the description.

54
00:05:01,880 --> 00:05:05,760
We see that the book is called sheet metal - green in a long pan.

55
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,760
We see ISBN.

56
00:05:08,220 --> 00:05:13,080
That there is a origin and information on publication.

57
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:17,120
It is published by Norstedts 2018.

58
00:05:17,320 --> 00:05:21,840
If we click on "Show more" we will see the number of pages and more.

59
00:05:22,740 --> 00:05:29,660
A little further up the right we see when the post is created and last changed and of which Sigel.

60
00:05:29,940 --> 00:05:34,940
We see Posten's ID and we can copy it if needed.

61
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:38,720
A little further down there is information about stocks.

62
00:05:38,940 --> 00:05:42,040
We can set stocks if we have not already done so.

63
00:05:42,260 --> 00:05:48,460
We can see how many other libraries have set stocks and we can show all stock items.

64
00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:58,520
The list of stock items is now displayed in a side panel.
 To close the side panel, press ESC.

65
00:05:58,980 --> 00:06:00,860
Let's move on.

66
00:06:01,100 --> 00:06:05,540
The next headlines are instance and admin metadata.

67
00:06:05,900 --> 00:06:11,960
There are two views that can be switched between.
 We start by switching to admin metadata

68
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:13,800
by clicking on it.

69
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:20,240
Here is administrative information about the mail, such as the description level,

70
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:26,620
cataloging rules and information on mechanical changes that have been made.

71
00:06:27,100 --> 00:06:31,340
Most of this is done automatically and you do not have to change a lot.

72
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:36,260
But in particular, note that it is important to choose the right description level.

73
00:06:36,540 --> 00:06:41,040
Read more about it in the Help text for admin metadata.

74
00:06:41,640 --> 00:06:44,840
We switch view back to instance.

75
00:06:45,140 --> 00:06:49,740
The instance contains information that is specific to the edition.

76
00:06:50,060 --> 00:06:56,940
The instance currently contains the work information embedded locally during the instance of works.

77
00:06:57,480 --> 00:07:00,100
We start by expanding the mail.

78
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:04,940
We do this by pressing Alt and Plus at the same time.

79
00:07:05,780 --> 00:07:13,020
You can expand and minimize each section also by clicking the arrow at the heading.

80
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:17,980
We first look at the work information during the instance of works.

81
00:07:18,280 --> 00:07:22,800
As you know from previous films, the work information is not linked,

82
00:07:22,980 --> 00:07:26,180
Without it locally embedded in each instance.

83
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:29,700
We see that this is a text.

84
00:07:31,080 --> 00:07:35,400
We will look at what qualities are attached to the work here.

85
00:07:35,620 --> 00:07:38,960
First we have the property involvement and function.

86
00:07:39,260 --> 00:07:44,820
Here we have stated that primary participation is an agent with the writer function.

87
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:48,240
The agent is an entity.

88
00:07:48,860 --> 00:07:53,460
We can right -click the entity and open it in a new tab.

89
00:07:54,100 --> 00:07:57,180
Here we see the information about this person.

90
00:07:58,300 --> 00:08:03,680
We can link to this entity several times if there are several works from her.

91
00:08:05,460 --> 00:08:10,220
The writer function is also an entity that we can link to if needed.

92
00:08:11,080 --> 00:08:15,680
In the same way, it works with language and genre/form.

93
00:08:16,420 --> 00:08:23,620
Genre describes what something is and this is a cookbook.
 We have linked to the entity for cookbooks.

94
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:28,400
Classification, on the other hand, does not contain linked entities.

95
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:34,380
Instead, classification lies as a local entity and the information is entered.

96
00:08:34,960 --> 00:08:39,820
There is both dewey classification and SAB classification.

97
00:08:41,540 --> 00:08:43,840
There are also subject words.

98
00:08:44,360 --> 00:08:49,740
Subject words describe what the work is about, unlike genre that describes what it is.

99
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:56,460
This cookbook is about vegetarian food and we have linked to the entity for it.

100
00:08:57,960 --> 00:09:01,800
Sometimes you describe agents and subject words without linking.

101
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:05,280
More about that in the movie qualities and entities.

102
00:09:06,760 --> 00:09:09,580
There is also a link to the content type text.

103
00:09:10,120 --> 00:09:16,020
Then we were done with the work information and we move on to the instance.

104
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:20,940
The body is about what is specific to the edition.

105
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:26,320
Here we enter the identifier as in this case is ISBN.

106
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:36,700
Title, publishing, e.g.
 Place of publishing, publisher and publishing year.

107
00:09:37,740 --> 00:09:43,380
And we also have scope and there we have the number of pages that the book has.

108
00:09:44,840 --> 00:09:48,680
We will look at a tool menu that we see here.

109
00:09:49,160 --> 00:09:52,760
There are three buttons.
 First show as.

110
00:09:53,280 --> 00:09:59,600
You can see the post in the storage format JSON-LD and a few other linked data formats.

111
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:06,880
During the tool icon there are several choices.
 You can expand or minimize all properties.

112
00:10:07,560 --> 00:10:09,600
You can copy the entire entry.

113
00:10:10,020 --> 00:10:16,380
You can also download the mail in Marc format to import it into its local system.

114
00:10:16,820 --> 00:10:24,060
You can also download it in JSON LD format or see the information in a Marc view.

115
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:30,100
Then a side panel comes out and to close it we press ESC.

116
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:34,200
Here you will also find the instance.

117
00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:37,960
The last button is edit.

118
00:10:38,380 --> 00:10:43,200
Here you now get some more choices under the tool menu.

119
00:10:44,860 --> 00:10:51,440
You see that under tools you have now received enrich from template, enrich from mail and detailed enrichment

120
00:10:51,660 --> 00:10:58,360
And we will go through them in the movie Edit, upgrade and enrich.

121
00:10:59,160 --> 00:11:06,400
You can add properties with the plus button.
 You can cancel and you have two savings buttons.

122
00:11:06,660 --> 00:11:10,760
With the first you save and continue to be in editing mode.

123
00:11:11,080 --> 00:11:14,660
With the other you save and leave edit mode.

124
00:11:14,940 --> 00:11:19,040
When you save an entry, all empty properties disappear.

125
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:25,400
If something is pre -filled, you need to remove it manually if you have not used that property.

126
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:32,860
It was all for this movie.
 There are more films about different elements in Libris cataloging.
