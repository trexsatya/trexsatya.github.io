1
00:00:08,192 --> 00:00:12,032
It's nice to be here and see such a crowded hall.

2
00:00:12,032 --> 00:00:18,176
I am also very happy to sit here with pink, we are not seen too often.

3
00:00:18,176 --> 00:00:20,480
The last time we would see it was nothing because you were sick.

4
00:00:21,248 --> 00:00:22,528
We will talk about

5
00:00:23,040 --> 00:00:29,184
The "river" today or "Väylä" as it is called in original.
 We should also talk about other things and I thought we will start

6
00:00:29,440 --> 00:00:30,720
from the beginning because

7
00:00:31,488 --> 00:00:33,280
You have just come from Tornedalen!

8
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:37,888
I was up there in

9
00:00:38,144 --> 00:00:40,704
Tornedalen

10
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:42,752
Where I was born.

11
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:46,336
I have a small cottage there.

12
00:00:47,616 --> 00:00:49,920
It's mine

13
00:00:50,176 --> 00:00:54,064
Grandma's old cabin

14
00:00:54,272 --> 00:00:58,500
Which I bought 5 years ago.

15
00:00:58,880 --> 00:01:03,488
I usually stay there around the year

16
00:01:04,512 --> 00:01:06,560
I have ...

17
00:01:07,072 --> 00:01:08,864
a part of me

18
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:16,590
Have moved back to my roots.

19
00:01:17,056 --> 00:01:20,128
I was away for 35 years

20
00:01:20,128 --> 00:01:23,712
Now it's a new situation

21
00:01:23,712 --> 00:01:27,552
and i went skiing

22
00:01:28,832 --> 00:01:31,648
10 days and there were

23
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:34,208
One meter of snow.

24
00:01:35,232 --> 00:01:39,460
Completely white nice snow.

25
00:01:40,352 --> 00:01:43,936
When I left my cabin

26
00:01:44,448 --> 00:01:50,681
It was 28 degrees cold.

27
00:01:51,616 --> 00:01:54,239
It was pretty cold.

28
00:01:54,944 --> 00:02:00,313
The sun was shining.

29
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:07,320
It was like a postcard,

30
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,536
The whole landscape.

31
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:14,400
It is the landscape that

32
00:02:14,656 --> 00:02:17,472
Also available in this book.

33
00:02:17,728 --> 00:02:18,496
The river

34
00:02:21,312 --> 00:02:29,022
If we go even further back in time, you have written 20 books.

35
00:02:29,022 --> 00:02:31,022
You debuted in 1985

36
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:38,720
But as I said, you come from Tornedalen and just from the landscape that you have just described to us.

37
00:02:39,232 --> 00:02:40,512
Then I wonder about

38
00:02:40,768 --> 00:02:44,352
Your background?
 How did you come from Tornedalen?

39
00:02:44,864 --> 00:02:46,400
Suddenly

40
00:02:46,656 --> 00:02:48,960
you among Finland's foremost writers

41
00:02:49,216 --> 00:02:49,984
And artists.

42
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:53,312
It is a fairly long development and long way.

43
00:02:54,336 --> 00:02:56,128
It is a very long way.

44
00:02:56,384 --> 00:02:58,944
And there is a lot of work.

45
00:02:59,456 --> 00:03:00,480
It is.

46
00:03:00,992 --> 00:03:03,296
Namely

47
00:03:03,552 --> 00:03:08,416
the books or book like this one, the "river"

48
00:03:08,928 --> 00:03:12,256
and the “overstinner and“ coupe No. 6 ”

49
00:03:12,768 --> 00:03:14,816
They demand

50
00:03:16,352 --> 00:03:19,168
Many years of work.

51
00:03:21,728 --> 00:03:23,520
When I started,

52
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:29,920
It was so that I wished I

53
00:03:30,432 --> 00:03:34,784
would become a teacher in Russian.

54
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:39,904
It was my biggest dream.

55
00:03:40,416 --> 00:03:41,952
But

56
00:03:42,464 --> 00:03:46,048
Life doesn't go that often

57
00:03:46,304 --> 00:03:48,352
that way

58
00:03:48,608 --> 00:03:50,144
You think.

59
00:03:50,656 --> 00:03:56,032
There are different roads.
 So I became anthropologist

60
00:03:56,288 --> 00:03:58,592
I studied

61
00:03:58,848 --> 00:04:06,149
At the University of Helsinki, I have also studied at Uppsala University,

62
00:04:06,784 --> 00:04:07,808
Russian language.

63
00:04:08,576 --> 00:04:12,160
But it was only for three months

64
00:04:12,928 --> 00:04:17,024
Before I was told I got a

65
00:04:17,536 --> 00:04:22,143
Student place at the University of Helsinki.

66
00:04:22,399 --> 00:04:25,471
So I left Uppsala

67
00:04:25,983 --> 00:04:28,031
and moved to Helsinki.

68
00:04:29,823 --> 00:04:35,948
I know Sweden quite well because

69
00:04:36,223 --> 00:04:41,068
I was born at the border with Sweden,

70
00:04:41,599 --> 00:04:43,391
Up there in Norrbotten.

71
00:04:44,671 --> 00:04:47,231
My relatives live there on

72
00:04:47,743 --> 00:04:48,767
Swedish side.

73
00:04:50,303 --> 00:04:51,583
When I was young,

74
00:04:51,839 --> 00:04:55,423
or children, so we have all the time as well as

75
00:04:55,935 --> 00:05:00,287
Visited my relatives on the Swedish side.

76
00:05:01,567 --> 00:05:03,615
And we talk meänkieli,

77
00:05:03,871 --> 00:05:05,919
So it goes like this.

78
00:05:06,431 --> 00:05:07,455
But

79
00:05:07,711 --> 00:05:09,247
How I became

80
00:05:09,759 --> 00:05:13,087
writer and artist it is

81
00:05:14,111 --> 00:05:16,159
very difficult to say

82
00:05:16,671 --> 00:05:18,207
Why it was so.

83
00:05:18,463 --> 00:05:23,071
I wrote my first three books

84
00:05:23,839 --> 00:05:24,607
in Denmark.

85
00:05:25,119 --> 00:05:26,399
I lived

86
00:05:26,655 --> 00:05:28,703
in Christiania

87
00:05:28,959 --> 00:05:29,983
in Copenhagen

88
00:05:30,495 --> 00:05:32,799
and worked

89
00:05:33,311 --> 00:05:37,663
In the purchasing center four

90
00:05:37,919 --> 00:05:39,199
hours a day

91
00:05:40,223 --> 00:05:42,527
And i had plenty of time

92
00:05:44,319 --> 00:05:49,439
And I couldn't speak Danish during the first year.

93
00:05:50,463 --> 00:05:54,303
I spoke like Swedish that I talk now.

94
00:05:54,815 --> 00:06:00,959
But the Danes don't like it.
 I learned

95
00:06:01,215 --> 00:06:05,567
That the Danes hate Swedes.

96
00:06:06,847 --> 00:06:10,175
So I had a lot of time and I started writing there.

97
00:06:11,711 --> 00:06:13,759
Maybe it was to

98
00:06:14,271 --> 00:06:18,879
I was also a languageless person

99
00:06:19,647 --> 00:06:22,975
And so I had to need to

100
00:06:23,743 --> 00:06:25,279
Express myself.

101
00:06:25,791 --> 00:06:28,607
So I started writing ...

102
00:06:28,863 --> 00:06:31,167
or first I started

103
00:06:31,423 --> 00:06:35,007
Draw series,

104
00:06:35,263 --> 00:06:38,587
Series.

105
00:06:38,847 --> 00:06:40,127
It was the first one,

106
00:06:40,383 --> 00:06:42,943
and then it became like

107
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:47,475
Stories and paintings.

108
00:06:48,057 --> 00:06:54,463
I made a book of serial pictures in Denmark.

109
00:06:55,487 --> 00:06:58,559
Then I started writing

110
00:06:58,815 --> 00:07:00,607
Short stories

111
00:07:01,119 --> 00:07:02,911
And paint paintings.

112
00:07:03,167 --> 00:07:05,471
And I have now done in

113
00:07:07,519 --> 00:07:08,799
45 years.

114
00:07:10,079 --> 00:07:13,151
I do it every day,

115
00:07:13,663 --> 00:07:14,943
almost every day.

116
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:17,503
So I like

117
00:07:18,527 --> 00:07:23,580
Learn me all the time my work again.

118
00:07:23,903 --> 00:07:24,671
As well as,

119
00:07:24,927 --> 00:07:28,511
Practice, I do exercises all the time.

120
00:07:32,607 --> 00:07:33,887
Now my books are

121
00:07:34,143 --> 00:07:36,447
very

122
00:07:37,215 --> 00:07:41,567
finely translated into different languages in Europe

123
00:07:41,823 --> 00:07:43,103
And other places too.

124
00:07:44,895 --> 00:07:49,759
But it has not come from heaven, it is work.

125
00:07:50,783 --> 00:07:52,575
Yes, it's a lot of work!

126
00:07:52,831 --> 00:07:55,647
A small question now about this with background.

127
00:07:55,903 --> 00:07:58,207
What did you read as a child yourself?

128
00:07:58,207 --> 00:07:59,231
And what did you have for

129
00:07:59,999 --> 00:08:01,791
storytelling traditions in your home?

130
00:08:06,655 --> 00:08:08,959
There were 2 books in my home.

131
00:08:08,959 --> 00:08:12,799
It was the Bible, as I never read

132
00:08:12,799 --> 00:08:15,359
And then it was another book

133
00:08:15,871 --> 00:08:18,175
As I never read.

134
00:08:18,687 --> 00:08:23,039
So I started reading when I was

135
00:08:23,295 --> 00:08:25,087
35 years old.

136
00:08:25,599 --> 00:08:27,647
Fiction, novels

137
00:08:28,159 --> 00:08:29,439
I just read

138
00:08:31,487 --> 00:08:34,303
Research books ...

139
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:40,703
... fiction only.

140
00:08:40,959 --> 00:08:42,751
Also at university.

141
00:08:43,007 --> 00:08:44,287
So I wasn't

142
00:08:44,543 --> 00:08:47,103
at all interested in fiction,

143
00:08:47,615 --> 00:08:49,919
novels or

144
00:08:52,735 --> 00:08:53,759
novellas,

145
00:08:54,527 --> 00:08:55,551
Not at all!

146
00:08:55,807 --> 00:08:57,087
But

147
00:08:58,111 --> 00:09:00,671
In my home and in my hometown

148
00:09:01,183 --> 00:09:03,487
is it a very strong

149
00:09:06,559 --> 00:09:07,327
Story tradition.

150
00:09:08,863 --> 00:09:11,167
That is

151
00:09:11,423 --> 00:09:13,215
People love

152
00:09:13,471 --> 00:09:16,543
to tell stories.

153
00:09:16,799 --> 00:09:19,103
And many stories

154
00:09:19,359 --> 00:09:23,455
If people who have lived there once,

155
00:09:23,711 --> 00:09:25,247
in history,

156
00:09:25,503 --> 00:09:30,111
in that rural village and what had happened during

157
00:09:30,367 --> 00:09:31,135
that time.

158
00:09:31,647 --> 00:09:41,263
I have grown up with an oral storytelling tradition.

159
00:09:41,631 --> 00:09:47,775
It is the same as reading books and

160
00:09:48,031 --> 00:09:54,888
The storytelling tradition was so strong,

161
00:09:55,199 --> 00:10:01,968
I have listened to,

162
00:10:02,367 --> 00:10:06,262
All year round, on different stories.

163
00:10:06,262 --> 00:10:07,487
In my hometown was there,

164
00:10:07,487 --> 00:10:11,583
the neighbour

165
00:10:12,095 --> 00:10:15,423
was a man named Veine

166
00:10:15,935 --> 00:10:16,447
He is dead

167
00:10:16,784 --> 00:10:21,823
But he was so amazing

168
00:10:22,591 --> 00:10:23,615
narrator

169
00:10:24,127 --> 00:10:28,479
of the story of the village and all people so

170
00:10:28,735 --> 00:10:31,807
I loved that

171
00:10:32,063 --> 00:10:33,599
Listen to him,

172
00:10:33,855 --> 00:10:34,879
for example.

173
00:10:35,647 --> 00:10:38,207
And my mother was also a lot of one

174
00:10:38,719 --> 00:10:40,767
very good storytelling and

175
00:10:41,023 --> 00:10:44,632
Many, many neighbors.

176
00:10:44,863 --> 00:10:49,521
Such absolutely incredible storytellers!
 That's my background.

177
00:10:50,239 --> 00:10:53,311
When I start writing on meänkieli

178
00:10:53,567 --> 00:10:56,895
or Tornedals dialect,

179
00:10:57,151 --> 00:11:01,503
On the Finnish side, we call it Tornedals dialect.

180
00:11:02,015 --> 00:11:04,575
And then on the Swedish side with Meänkieli,

181
00:11:05,599 --> 00:11:09,464
Although it is like the same language.

182
00:11:11,231 --> 00:11:14,559
When I start writing on meänkieli

183
00:11:15,071 --> 00:11:20,724
so it came like fluent

184
00:11:20,959 --> 00:11:21,983
from my body.

185
00:11:24,031 --> 00:11:26,079
For that is what I have

186
00:11:26,591 --> 00:11:29,919
grown up with.

187
00:11:31,711 --> 00:11:37,855
I was 15 years old when I moved from that countryside

188
00:11:38,623 --> 00:11:39,903
Because

189
00:11:40,415 --> 00:11:42,207
I wanted to study

190
00:11:43,231 --> 00:11:44,767
It was 70s

191
00:11:45,279 --> 00:11:48,607
and the first idea

192
00:11:49,887 --> 00:11:51,167
was to study.

193
00:11:51,935 --> 00:11:55,007
To go to university and study.

194
00:11:55,519 --> 00:12:00,639
Almost all children in that village had that idea.

195
00:12:01,407 --> 00:12:07,551
That we want to study and we want to go out of this village, we want to live in Storbyar.

196
00:12:09,343 --> 00:12:10,879
And I did.

197
00:12:11,135 --> 00:12:14,034
I moved to Helsinki

198
00:12:14,463 --> 00:12:17,535
and then to Moscow

199
00:12:18,047 --> 00:12:21,119
and then to Christiania and then to

200
00:12:21,375 --> 00:12:26,622
Texas in the United States.

201
00:12:29,567 --> 00:12:35,711
It is incredible, this longing away from the village and about studying.

202
00:12:35,711 --> 00:12:39,289
I think about this with the story because it is something that is characteristic of what you write,

203
00:12:39,289 --> 00:12:42,367
For what you write, ie the narrator.

204
00:12:42,623 --> 00:12:43,391
How it

205
00:12:43,647 --> 00:12:46,178
lives in the text

206
00:12:46,719 --> 00:12:50,980
We'll get to it soon, to the river.

207
00:12:51,583 --> 00:12:52,863
I just have to

208
00:12:53,375 --> 00:12:55,935
Ask from time to time.
 Where does the interest in the Russian come from?

209
00:12:57,727 --> 00:12:59,519
Yes, it is very interesting!

210
00:12:59,775 --> 00:13:02,335
That's a big question.

211
00:13:03,615 --> 00:13:05,407
Namely,

212
00:13:05,663 --> 00:13:08,479
Because I was born on the Swedish side

213
00:13:09,503 --> 00:13:14,141
So Sweden was always the best friend.

214
00:13:14,367 --> 00:13:19,743
We thought in my hometown, all people thought that Sweden

215
00:13:19,999 --> 00:13:21,535
is our best friend.

216
00:13:23,327 --> 00:13:24,095
It was so.

217
00:13:24,607 --> 00:13:30,239
Russia was away, gone, gone.

218
00:13:30,751 --> 00:13:37,460
People who live there on the Swedish side do not like the Russians

219
00:13:37,663 --> 00:13:39,426
Or Russia.

220
00:13:39,711 --> 00:13:42,015
That's all for

221
00:13:44,063 --> 00:13:54,470
different ways of life there and the language is so strange with different letters and

222
00:13:58,143 --> 00:14:01,471
a cruel story that we have had

223
00:14:01,727 --> 00:14:03,263
With the Russians.

224
00:14:03,519 --> 00:14:05,823
We have also had a very hard

225
00:14:06,079 --> 00:14:12,617
History with Sweden.
 But we think the Swedes are our friends.

226
00:14:12,991 --> 00:14:14,271
But the Russians are not.

227
00:14:16,063 --> 00:14:21,695
We were part of Sweden for 600 years,

228
00:14:23,231 --> 00:14:26,559
600-800 years part of Sweden,

229
00:14:26,815 --> 00:14:30,399
And only 100 years part of Russia.

230
00:14:31,679 --> 00:14:34,239
But we have had

231
00:14:35,775 --> 00:14:39,871
two big wars with the Russians

232
00:14:40,383 --> 00:14:51,087
not too long ago.

233
00:14:51,647 --> 00:14:55,999
My interest in Russia was namely

234
00:14:56,255 --> 00:14:59,071
that when I moved to Rovaniemi

235
00:14:59,839 --> 00:15:01,631
To go to high school,

236
00:15:02,143 --> 00:15:04,703
and Rovaniemi was the largest

237
00:15:04,959 --> 00:15:08,287
The city in Lapland

238
00:15:08,287 --> 00:15:11,359
There lived

239
00:15:11,359 --> 00:15:15,185
30,000 people.

240
00:15:15,711 --> 00:15:19,807
But I thought it's a big city and I wanted to study there

241
00:15:20,063 --> 00:15:25,183
I moved there and I was very pleased to live in a big city

242
00:15:25,439 --> 00:15:26,719
because

243
00:15:26,975 --> 00:15:29,279
In my hometown there were only eight houses.

244
00:15:30,559 --> 00:15:34,399
But in each house more than 10 children.

245
00:15:35,679 --> 00:15:37,727
Laestadians live there.

246
00:15:40,799 --> 00:15:43,615
Rovaniemi was Storbyn

247
00:15:44,383 --> 00:15:47,967
But it was the 70s and one did

248
00:15:48,223 --> 00:15:49,503
at that time

249
00:15:49,759 --> 00:15:51,295
Vodka travel.

250
00:15:51,551 --> 00:15:54,094
Vodka - slug, glow, glow

251
00:15:54,094 --> 00:15:56,159
Travel to Russia

252
00:15:56,415 --> 00:15:58,975
And the trips went to Murmansk

253
00:15:59,999 --> 00:16:03,327
For that murmansk was the largest

254
00:16:03,583 --> 00:16:05,631
the nearest big village

255
00:16:05,887 --> 00:16:06,911
To Rovaniemi.

256
00:16:08,703 --> 00:16:09,983
One day

257
00:16:10,751 --> 00:16:12,799
did i go to the bus

258
00:16:13,567 --> 00:16:15,871
and traveled to Murmansk.

259
00:16:16,383 --> 00:16:18,687
Murmansk is there

260
00:16:19,455 --> 00:16:22,527
on the bank of the ice sea

261
00:16:25,087 --> 00:16:28,831
And when I saw the town

262
00:16:29,183 --> 00:16:31,487
Was I so surprised

263
00:16:31,999 --> 00:16:33,023
because

264
00:16:33,535 --> 00:16:37,119
At that time it lived

265
00:16:37,375 --> 00:16:39,423
Half a million people there.

266
00:16:43,263 --> 00:16:46,591
There all kinds of

267
00:16:50,687 --> 00:16:51,967
Restaurants.

268
00:16:52,735 --> 00:16:58,879
Food from XXX, from Uzbekistan, Kazakhstan various restaurants.

269
00:17:00,159 --> 00:17:02,975
I had always eaten such food.

270
00:17:03,999 --> 00:17:08,351
And I was so inspired by all of these

271
00:17:08,863 --> 00:17:13,727
restaurants and food and then these strange letters.

272
00:17:14,239 --> 00:17:16,543
Also by people for

273
00:17:16,799 --> 00:17:18,335
They were very young.

274
00:17:19,103 --> 00:17:23,711
The average age of Murmansk was 25 years old,

275
00:17:24,479 --> 00:17:28,831
I was 15 years old, so 10 years older than me.

276
00:17:29,343 --> 00:17:35,487
I went to the disco that was full of young people.

277
00:17:36,255 --> 00:17:38,047
So I started

278
00:17:38,303 --> 00:17:40,351
take

279
00:17:40,607 --> 00:17:45,215
Once a month the bus,

280
00:17:45,983 --> 00:17:47,519
Travel to Murmansk.

281
00:17:48,031 --> 00:17:50,335
And like Baila there,

282
00:17:50,847 --> 00:17:52,895
party there, dance there

283
00:17:53,407 --> 00:17:56,479
Yes, eat such ...

284
00:18:01,855 --> 00:18:04,927
incredible,

285
00:18:05,183 --> 00:18:07,743
Incredible flavors

286
00:18:09,535 --> 00:18:11,583
So I became like

287
00:18:11,839 --> 00:18:14,143
In love with Russia.

288
00:18:14,399 --> 00:18:15,935
I have to say that.

289
00:18:16,191 --> 00:18:22,335
Then I started studying the Russian language as a voluntary subject in high school.

290
00:18:23,871 --> 00:18:27,455
And I have continued to study Russian

291
00:18:28,991 --> 00:18:30,783
to this day.

292
00:18:32,063 --> 00:18:34,879
Once in

293
00:18:35,391 --> 00:18:36,927
week

294
00:18:38,975 --> 00:18:44,607
We are like 10 people, we meet and talk Russian.

295
00:18:45,119 --> 00:18:48,447
We have a teacher who

296
00:18:53,311 --> 00:18:59,455
Leads and teaches, it's like a discussion group.

297
00:19:00,991 --> 00:19:02,783
So we discuss in Russian.

298
00:19:03,039 --> 00:19:04,063
It is fantastic.

299
00:19:04,575 --> 00:19:07,647
So Russia

300
00:19:08,159 --> 00:19:12,511
came to be a part of my life and that is all the time

301
00:19:13,279 --> 00:19:15,583
Today the same.

302
00:19:15,839 --> 00:19:19,679
For what I have friends living in Russia

303
00:19:19,935 --> 00:19:21,983
and I love

304
00:19:23,007 --> 00:19:23,775
The Russian culture.

305
00:19:24,031 --> 00:19:25,311
I have to say that.

306
00:19:25,567 --> 00:19:28,383
And I love Russian people

307
00:19:29,407 --> 00:19:30,687
because

308
00:19:31,199 --> 00:19:33,503
they are

309
00:19:33,759 --> 00:19:34,527
close

310
00:19:35,039 --> 00:19:39,135
Finns.
 They are a lot

311
00:19:42,207 --> 00:19:45,023
Direct people

312
00:19:45,279 --> 00:19:47,327
And very full of

313
00:19:47,583 --> 00:19:48,863
feelings

314
00:19:49,119 --> 00:19:50,911
as they show.

315
00:19:51,167 --> 00:19:53,471
And to Finlanders it is like

316
00:19:53,727 --> 00:19:55,519
We are not

317
00:19:55,775 --> 00:19:59,103
such people who want to show

318
00:20:02,943 --> 00:20:04,735
Our feelings.

319
00:20:06,271 --> 00:20:07,295
But we

320
00:20:10,111 --> 00:20:12,671
understands the Russians

321
00:20:12,927 --> 00:20:15,487
Feelings very well.
 So it's like

322
00:20:15,999 --> 00:20:19,071
Such a strange situation.

323
00:20:19,583 --> 00:20:21,631
And that is what is interesting.

324
00:20:22,399 --> 00:20:24,959
I think it's amazing that you keep up this Russian group

325
00:20:27,263 --> 00:20:28,543
under the prevailing circumstances.

326
00:20:30,847 --> 00:20:34,431
There are lots of ingredients in your artistry, in your authorship.

327
00:20:34,687 --> 00:20:42,879
And I will think of Tove Jansson who also made picture and text at the same time, you are both bondy

328
00:20:42,879 --> 00:20:44,415
In your art.

329
00:20:45,183 --> 00:20:47,999
Now we have to go to the "river" finally!

330
00:20:49,023 --> 00:20:53,375
There is so much you would like to do here but the "river" ...

331
00:20:55,935 --> 00:21:01,055
Actually, it is best if you describe it yourself.
 What is the story?

332
00:21:01,311 --> 00:21:02,335
Where does it come from?

333
00:21:04,383 --> 00:21:10,527
I think that here can be people who have read the "colonel"?

334
00:21:12,575 --> 00:21:13,599
Yes, some

335
00:21:13,855 --> 00:21:16,672
When I wrote the "Colonel"

336
00:21:22,048 --> 00:21:23,328
I noticed

337
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:26,144
that in that novel

338
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:27,680
I couldn't

339
00:21:28,192 --> 00:21:31,520
begin to describe the Lapland War

340
00:21:32,032 --> 00:21:34,080
because it gets too much

341
00:21:34,336 --> 00:21:35,360
In a book.

342
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:39,712
When the "Upper" was finished

343
00:21:39,968 --> 00:21:44,320
had that feeling

344
00:21:44,576 --> 00:21:46,368
that I wanted to write

345
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:50,464
About the Lapland War.
 But I had

346
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:56,096
Like not found

347
00:21:56,608 --> 00:21:58,400
the main character.

348
00:21:59,168 --> 00:22:03,520
But when I sat in my cabin

349
00:22:03,776 --> 00:22:04,800
in Tornedalen

350
00:22:05,312 --> 00:22:07,360
I got a visit

351
00:22:07,872 --> 00:22:09,152
by my dear friend.

352
00:22:11,456 --> 00:22:15,296
He is 90 years old or 91

353
00:22:15,552 --> 00:22:16,576
or 92 years old

354
00:22:17,088 --> 00:22:21,696
And he is man to my mother's sister

355
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:25,024
I have known him

356
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:26,304
all my life.

357
00:22:26,816 --> 00:22:29,888
He got there and he started telling

358
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:32,192
About that

359
00:22:32,448 --> 00:22:35,008
The trip to Sweden.

360
00:22:37,312 --> 00:22:40,640
What it was like to be

361
00:22:40,896 --> 00:22:42,688
War refugee

362
00:22:51,136 --> 00:22:52,928
You know that when

363
00:22:53,184 --> 00:22:57,280
people get older, not all but many,

364
00:22:58,048 --> 00:23:00,608
that have good memory,

365
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:07,264
They also start telling about their childhood more than ever.

366
00:23:11,872 --> 00:23:17,504
Each time Pauli came to my cabin

367
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:21,344
To drink coffee or when I went to visit

368
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:22,624
with him,

369
00:23:23,136 --> 00:23:27,232
he began to tell his story.

370
00:23:28,256 --> 00:23:31,072
And it was so strong and strong.

371
00:23:31,584 --> 00:23:37,472
I had heard many parts of his story

372
00:23:37,984 --> 00:23:39,520
But not the whole.

373
00:23:40,032 --> 00:23:41,568
It was so strong.

374
00:23:42,848 --> 00:23:46,944
Every time he started telling it

375
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:48,736
he began to cry.

376
00:23:51,808 --> 00:23:56,160
When I listened to him

377
00:23:56,672 --> 00:23:59,744
I noticed that it is

378
00:24:02,816 --> 00:24:06,144
He who is the main character.
 He was

379
00:24:06,656 --> 00:24:09,472
11 years old

380
00:24:09,728 --> 00:24:10,752
when he

381
00:24:11,008 --> 00:24:17,152
went to war refugee camp in Sweden

382
00:24:17,664 --> 00:24:20,736
null

383
00:24:20,992 --> 00:24:22,784
when the Lapland War

384
00:24:23,040 --> 00:24:23,552
Started.

385
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:26,624
All civilian people, children,

386
00:24:28,416 --> 00:24:31,488
Older people and women and cows

387
00:24:34,304 --> 00:24:35,072
Moved

388
00:24:35,328 --> 00:24:36,096
to Sweden,

389
00:24:36,864 --> 00:24:40,192
for that became war between Finland and

390
00:24:40,448 --> 00:24:41,216
Germany.

391
00:24:41,216 --> 00:24:43,216
CHOR !!
 Muu!

392
00:24:50,176 --> 00:24:56,320
It was intended that when the war began, the civilian population was evacuated.

393
00:25:03,488 --> 00:25:05,280
And Pauli could

394
00:25:08,352 --> 00:25:11,168
remember

395
00:25:13,728 --> 00:25:16,288
Details from that trip.

396
00:25:16,800 --> 00:25:22,944
And he told me, he is a very, very nice storyteller.

397
00:25:29,088 --> 00:25:34,208
He as well as became the main character in the book

398
00:25:35,488 --> 00:25:36,512
But I made it

399
00:25:36,768 --> 00:25:37,536
to

400
00:25:37,792 --> 00:25:38,304
A girl.

401
00:25:39,328 --> 00:25:42,144
Because my mother was there too

402
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:44,192
But my mother is dead.

403
00:25:44,704 --> 00:25:50,592
But she also told us a lot about that trip when she was alive.

404
00:25:51,104 --> 00:25:53,408
So i wanted

405
00:25:53,664 --> 00:25:54,688
A girl

406
00:25:55,712 --> 00:25:59,296
Like my mother as the main character.

407
00:25:59,808 --> 00:26:02,112
In the book is Matti

408
00:26:02,624 --> 00:26:03,392
also

409
00:26:03,904 --> 00:26:05,440
with on the whole trip,

410
00:26:05,952 --> 00:26:07,744
So it's like Pauli.

411
00:26:09,024 --> 00:26:10,816
The model is Pauli

412
00:26:12,608 --> 00:26:16,448
It is the girl who tells, the girl who is the main character.

413
00:26:17,216 --> 00:26:22,336
You could say that this is also a hiking story or a hiking novel for it ...

414
00:26:22,592 --> 00:26:25,152
How many thousands were there?

415
00:26:25,664 --> 00:26:29,760
There were 60,000 people

416
00:26:30,528 --> 00:26:36,160
which was brought from Finland over the Torne River

417
00:26:36,672 --> 00:26:39,232
to Sweden.
 There was no bridge

418
00:26:41,280 --> 00:26:42,304
There was only the ferry.

419
00:26:46,656 --> 00:26:47,424
A home -built ferry.

420
00:26:48,192 --> 00:26:54,336
During the war, winter war and World War II

421
00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:59,200
took people to Sweden with

422
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:01,248
rowing boat.

423
00:27:03,296 --> 00:27:06,112
But one could not

424
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:11,744
Shipping cows with rowing boat.

425
00:27:13,280 --> 00:27:16,864
So one had to build such

426
00:27:17,888 --> 00:27:19,168
Terrible ferries.

427
00:27:21,472 --> 00:27:26,336
The Torne River is large

428
00:27:27,104 --> 00:27:32,480
The water rushes very fast

429
00:27:33,504 --> 00:27:36,576
so it is very dangerous to cross the river

430
00:27:38,112 --> 00:27:41,184
with such a ferry and with many cows

431
00:27:47,584 --> 00:27:49,120
fell off and drowned.

432
00:27:55,264 --> 00:27:58,279
Nearly 30,000 cows

433
00:27:58,848 --> 00:28:00,640
was brought to Sweden.

434
00:28:01,152 --> 00:28:03,200
30,000 cows,

435
00:28:03,968 --> 00:28:04,736
think about it,

436
00:28:05,248 --> 00:28:07,808
over the river.

437
00:28:08,832 --> 00:28:12,416
It was a hell of a job and it was terrible

438
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:14,976
because the cows were so scared

439
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:17,280
to go on the ferry.

440
00:28:17,792 --> 00:28:20,608
But then it was and

441
00:28:21,888 --> 00:28:28,986
They also came back after the war.

442
00:28:28,986 --> 00:28:33,726
So it was.
 And they also sat in camps in their own way, everyone.

443
00:28:33,726 --> 00:28:38,684
Yes, it was KO camp, that's absolutely true!

444
00:28:39,040 --> 00:28:44,928
There were many, many cow camps and young women or not women,

445
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:47,488
Young girls

446
00:28:47,744 --> 00:28:50,304
took care of the cows.

447
00:28:50,304 --> 00:28:51,840
At that time it was so.

448
00:28:52,096 --> 00:28:55,168
The mothers had so many children

449
00:28:55,680 --> 00:28:59,264
that they had to be with the children

450
00:28:59,264 --> 00:29:01,824
in another camp.

451
00:29:01,824 --> 00:29:03,616
So the girls, like,

452
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:06,176
12 years old

453
00:29:06,688 --> 00:29:09,248
to 15 years old,

454
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:11,296
Also boys,

455
00:29:11,808 --> 00:29:13,856
they took care of the cows

456
00:29:14,112 --> 00:29:15,648
or milked them.

457
00:29:16,160 --> 00:29:19,232
There were many cow camps,

458
00:29:19,488 --> 00:29:24,430
An estimated 200 cows in a camp.

459
00:29:29,216 --> 00:29:32,032
All that situation

460
00:29:32,288 --> 00:29:35,684
When the Lapland War began,

461
00:29:35,872 --> 00:29:37,408
It was chaos.

462
00:29:37,920 --> 00:29:40,992
Finnish government

463
00:29:42,784 --> 00:29:43,552
asked

464
00:29:44,064 --> 00:29:46,112
Sweden's government

465
00:29:46,368 --> 00:29:48,160
- can you receive

466
00:29:48,416 --> 00:29:50,976
Finnish refugees?

467
00:29:51,744 --> 00:29:53,792
And the government said no,

468
00:29:54,304 --> 00:29:58,144
We have so many refugees here, we have

469
00:29:58,400 --> 00:30:00,960
100,000 from Denmark

470
00:30:01,216 --> 00:30:07,438
and 100,000 from Norway.

471
00:30:07,438 --> 00:30:11,200
And now you ask if we can take

472
00:30:11,712 --> 00:30:12,992
60,000

473
00:30:13,504 --> 00:30:15,040
Finnish refugees

474
00:30:15,296 --> 00:30:16,064
To Lapland?

475
00:30:16,576 --> 00:30:18,880
It is far too much said, the government.

476
00:30:19,392 --> 00:30:22,976
But the king, at that time he had power,

477
00:30:23,232 --> 00:30:25,792
The king said, we take them.

478
00:30:27,072 --> 00:30:28,864
And so it became.

479
00:30:29,888 --> 00:30:35,776
So the king drove over the government and said,

480
00:30:36,032 --> 00:30:37,056
No, we take them.

481
00:30:37,568 --> 00:30:41,152
But the problem was that there was

482
00:30:41,408 --> 00:30:44,224
So little time to build these camps.

483
00:30:47,040 --> 00:30:48,576
Because of that was

484
00:30:48,832 --> 00:30:52,416
All these barracks were old

485
00:30:52,672 --> 00:30:55,488
Summer barracks from

486
00:30:56,768 --> 00:30:58,048
Swedish Army.

487
00:30:59,584 --> 00:31:02,144
But it was a much cold winter

488
00:31:02,656 --> 00:31:04,448
And people lived

489
00:31:04,704 --> 00:31:07,520
In these summer barracks.

490
00:31:08,288 --> 00:31:11,360
And they were packed

491
00:31:13,664 --> 00:31:14,688
with people,

492
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:23,757
So there was no place, they were packed like sardines.

493
00:31:24,160 --> 00:31:27,488
You can remember, after all, that,

494
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:31,328
As you said, it was women, children

495
00:31:31,840 --> 00:31:32,864
and elderly.

496
00:31:33,376 --> 00:31:37,472
Because the men in warriors

497
00:31:37,472 --> 00:31:40,288
Be out in the war.
 So it was

498
00:31:40,800 --> 00:31:43,872
The weaker part that took care of this and were these refugees.

499
00:31:46,944 --> 00:31:51,040
It has not really been told so much about this in public.

500
00:31:51,808 --> 00:31:54,624
What do you think it is because it has been so quiet?

501
00:31:55,392 --> 00:31:56,416
For me it was one

502
00:31:56,928 --> 00:31:59,744
News with these

503
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:04,096
The camps in Sweden and so on, that there were so many as evacuated.

504
00:32:04,352 --> 00:32:06,656
What do you think it is?

505
00:32:07,680 --> 00:32:12,544
When I was a kid and teenager

506
00:32:12,544 --> 00:32:16,896
I heard these stories by my relatives.

507
00:32:20,224 --> 00:32:25,088
But it was not popular to talk about that time

508
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:33,660
Because people felt shame.

509
00:32:34,560 --> 00:32:38,144
They felt shame that they were refugees

510
00:32:38,912 --> 00:32:45,056
It is perfectly normal for people to feel that way.
 These are such psychological reactions.

511
00:32:46,336 --> 00:32:51,712
They did not want to talk about it that we have been refugees or

512
00:32:51,968 --> 00:33:00,481
that conditions in the camps were very hard.

513
00:33:00,481 --> 00:33:05,024
People wanted to forget about it

514
00:33:05,024 --> 00:33:10,391
And just start building a new life.

515
00:33:11,936 --> 00:33:15,008
People wanted to look ahead,

516
00:33:15,264 --> 00:33:17,312
Not on history.

517
00:33:17,312 --> 00:33:22,902
It's like behind and now we go on

518
00:33:25,760 --> 00:33:30,112
When we think of history books in Finland,

519
00:33:30,368 --> 00:33:31,904
Also in Sweden,

520
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:35,744
Don't you write about

521
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:37,536
this period,

522
00:33:38,304 --> 00:33:41,376
Only with some additions.

523
00:33:41,888 --> 00:33:45,216
About the Lapland War

524
00:33:45,728 --> 00:33:47,520
Do you write very little

525
00:33:47,776 --> 00:33:51,104
For Lapland is so far away,

526
00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:55,712
There are not so many people, so it doesn't matter.

527
00:33:55,968 --> 00:34:00,576
Everyone looks at southern Finland, what happened there,

528
00:34:00,832 --> 00:34:02,624
In Karelia,

529
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:06,464
where lots of people live.

530
00:34:06,976 --> 00:34:09,280
But Lapland is so far away.

531
00:34:09,536 --> 00:34:14,144
For example, from Helsinki to my home

532
00:34:15,424 --> 00:34:19,008
is it 965 km,

533
00:34:21,312 --> 00:34:23,104
965 kilometers.

534
00:34:23,360 --> 00:34:25,408
From Helsinki

535
00:34:25,920 --> 00:34:30,016
to Europe,

536
00:34:30,784 --> 00:34:38,142
to Paris or ... it's so long way

537
00:34:38,720 --> 00:34:40,256
So man

538
00:34:40,512 --> 00:34:42,816
Didn't want to talk about it.

539
00:34:42,816 --> 00:34:44,816
One has not written about this,

540
00:34:46,656 --> 00:34:52,560
not novels but i am quite sure that after this novel there will be more novels

541
00:34:53,824 --> 00:34:55,872
If this topic of

542
00:34:56,128 --> 00:34:58,176
It's so strange

543
00:34:58,944 --> 00:35:00,224
And that is so

544
00:35:00,736 --> 00:35:02,272
closely, not so

545
00:35:02,528 --> 00:35:05,088
far away in the story

546
00:35:05,600 --> 00:35:09,952
There are people, perhaps here too, people

547
00:35:10,208 --> 00:35:11,488
Who may have lived

548
00:35:11,744 --> 00:35:12,512
at that time

549
00:35:14,048 --> 00:35:16,352
or have parents who

550
00:35:16,608 --> 00:35:17,888
told about it.

551
00:35:20,704 --> 00:35:22,496
It has written as well as

552
00:35:23,008 --> 00:35:24,800
Hundreds of books about

553
00:35:25,312 --> 00:35:27,360
Refugees from Karelia

554
00:35:28,640 --> 00:35:29,920
But no books about

555
00:35:30,944 --> 00:35:33,760
This situation in Lapland

556
00:35:35,808 --> 00:35:36,320
It's true

557
00:35:36,832 --> 00:35:39,392
Then this book is, after all,

558
00:35:40,416 --> 00:35:46,048
I would almost say unfortunately, uncomfortably relevant considering the situation we have today.

559
00:35:46,816 --> 00:35:50,400
There are still corresponding phenomena.

560
00:35:53,216 --> 00:35:59,104
To write this book, you must at least take part in research.
 Was there a lot of work around?

561
00:36:00,128 --> 00:36:01,408
I am so pleased that

562
00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:06,041
Researchers and historians

563
00:36:06,272 --> 00:36:08,064
has made

564
00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:09,344
lots of

565
00:36:09,600 --> 00:36:11,136
Finework

566
00:36:11,392 --> 00:36:14,208
In the 80s about camps

567
00:36:14,720 --> 00:36:16,256
Namely...

568
00:36:16,512 --> 00:36:22,656
We know all the people who have lived in every barracks.

569
00:36:23,680 --> 00:36:28,800
All names are there, everyone born in barracks,

570
00:36:29,056 --> 00:36:31,872
Everyone who has died there.

571
00:36:32,384 --> 00:36:36,992
And everyone who died there is buried in Sweden.

572
00:36:38,272 --> 00:36:41,600
We have all the statistics.

573
00:36:42,112 --> 00:36:44,672
And researchers

574
00:36:44,928 --> 00:36:49,280
have done a tremendous fine work,

575
00:36:49,536 --> 00:36:52,608
They have placed all camps

576
00:36:53,120 --> 00:36:57,472
in Norrbotten.
 There were camps too

577
00:36:58,240 --> 00:36:59,520
in the Umeå area

578
00:37:01,568 --> 00:37:02,592
Pretty far south.

579
00:37:03,104 --> 00:37:08,480
There were thus about ten camps

580
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:13,344
The camps ... was because

581
00:37:16,416 --> 00:37:17,696
They were isolated,

582
00:37:17,952 --> 00:37:21,536
they were surrounded by barbed wire

583
00:37:22,048 --> 00:37:24,864
So one couldn't go out,

584
00:37:25,376 --> 00:37:26,656
You were trapped.

585
00:37:27,936 --> 00:37:29,472
When people

586
00:37:30,752 --> 00:37:34,080
asked why they could not go out from the camp,

587
00:37:35,872 --> 00:37:41,504
It was in the middle of the forest, not by the side of villages,

588
00:37:42,272 --> 00:37:45,600
Authorities only spoke Swedish

589
00:37:46,368 --> 00:37:48,672
at the time there,

590
00:37:48,928 --> 00:37:53,280
people who lived in the villages spoke Finnish

591
00:37:53,536 --> 00:37:55,840
But authorities spoke Swedish.

592
00:37:56,864 --> 00:38:01,984
And they said that you have to stay here to

593
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:07,104
We are afraid that you have

594
00:38:07,360 --> 00:38:08,896
tuberculosis

595
00:38:09,408 --> 00:38:10,944
and other

596
00:38:11,200 --> 00:38:12,736
diseases

597
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:19,392
As we do not want you to infect

598
00:38:19,904 --> 00:38:20,672
Swedish people with.

599
00:38:22,464 --> 00:38:25,280
They were like isolated.

600
00:38:26,816 --> 00:38:29,120
But there was food anyway.

601
00:38:34,752 --> 00:38:36,288
Then we have to talk about the girl.

602
00:38:36,544 --> 00:38:38,336
Or must and must

603
00:38:38,592 --> 00:38:41,920
Thus the girl is the main character in this novel

604
00:38:42,176 --> 00:38:43,712
It is through her eyes

605
00:38:43,910 --> 00:38:47,296
As we readers get to know this historical stage.

606
00:38:48,320 --> 00:38:51,648
And then I wonder firstly, we never know what her name is?

607
00:38:51,904 --> 00:38:53,440
How did you think, that

608
00:38:53,696 --> 00:38:58,048
Is she who tells us, is the janitor but we never know what her name is?

609
00:38:58,304 --> 00:38:59,840
And it's really nothing that man

610
00:39:00,096 --> 00:39:03,168
reflects on while reading without it is afterwards-

611
00:39:03,680 --> 00:39:04,960
How did you choose to

612
00:39:05,216 --> 00:39:07,008
Leave her without a name?

613
00:39:09,056 --> 00:39:13,920
Well, there are many other names in the book but she

614
00:39:14,176 --> 00:39:15,456
is the girl.

615
00:39:17,504 --> 00:39:19,808
I thought that...

616
00:39:24,672 --> 00:39:28,256
There has always been war here on the planet

617
00:39:29,536 --> 00:39:35,680
And still nowadays, many wars are going on in the world.

618
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:39,008
And it will be new

619
00:39:39,264 --> 00:39:39,776
war

620
00:39:40,288 --> 00:39:46,176
As long as we humans live here on earth.

621
00:39:46,432 --> 00:39:47,712
there will be war

622
00:39:47,968 --> 00:39:50,016
And there will be refugees.

623
00:39:50,272 --> 00:39:51,552
Refugees have

624
00:39:55,136 --> 00:39:57,440
existed throughout

625
00:39:57,696 --> 00:39:59,488
the history of mankind.

626
00:39:59,744 --> 00:40:00,512
Refugees

627
00:40:01,024 --> 00:40:05,376
And refugee streams or what we now call it.

628
00:40:09,472 --> 00:40:12,032
I'm just writing girl

629
00:40:12,288 --> 00:40:13,824
so it's easier for

630
00:40:14,848 --> 00:40:17,408
people in Albania,

631
00:40:18,176 --> 00:40:23,808
people Slovakia or in

632
00:40:24,064 --> 00:40:25,600
Mexico

633
00:40:25,856 --> 00:40:27,904
Or Brazil

634
00:40:28,160 --> 00:40:31,232
to identify

635
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:34,816
with this girl situation.

636
00:40:35,328 --> 00:40:38,400
For what I knew it was also translated

637
00:40:40,704 --> 00:40:41,984
Out there in the world.

638
00:40:42,240 --> 00:40:46,080
It's like

639
00:40:46,592 --> 00:40:49,152
A refugee girl

640
00:40:50,432 --> 00:40:52,736
who lives everywhere in the world.

641
00:40:54,016 --> 00:40:58,880
Yes, that's how it also feels when you read.
 That it is a consciousness

642
00:40:59,136 --> 00:41:01,952
and it is bigger than if it was fixed

643
00:41:02,208 --> 00:41:02,720
by a name.

644
00:41:03,488 --> 00:41:07,584
And she's there, and she's in 13 and 14 years of age and this one

645
00:41:07,840 --> 00:41:11,168
The story takes place for about eight months.

646
00:41:11,168 --> 00:41:16,288
She is fascinating because she is a child partly

647
00:41:16,544 --> 00:41:17,312
but she

648
00:41:17,568 --> 00:41:20,384
forced to become an adult because of the circumstances.

649
00:41:20,896 --> 00:41:26,528
And then she is also a reflective person, she ponders about

650
00:41:27,040 --> 00:41:28,320
the universe.

651
00:41:28,576 --> 00:41:32,001
She ponders nature, she ponders the starry sky.

652
00:41:32,001 --> 00:41:34,001
And so she is very responsible

653
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:41,376
Pretty incredible indeed!
 What strikes me among other things is that

654
00:41:42,144 --> 00:41:45,472
We have Christianity, we have science

655
00:41:45,984 --> 00:41:47,264
and all that

656
00:41:47,776 --> 00:41:51,104
Is included in her consciousness as she thinks about the world.

657
00:41:51,360 --> 00:41:52,384
And another thing

658
00:41:52,895 --> 00:41:58,527
which is also so fascinating, this is the relationship with nature,

659
00:41:58,783 --> 00:42:04,415
The nature that surrounds her and all the others and how you write this nature it is incredibly beautiful.

660
00:42:04,671 --> 00:42:06,207
You look like exactly,

661
00:42:06,463 --> 00:42:07,999
It is noticeable that you are a painter

662
00:42:10,047 --> 00:42:11,839
For as you reproduce nature through this girl

663
00:42:12,095 --> 00:42:14,143
and relationship with the animals

664
00:42:14,399 --> 00:42:15,679
For that is also all

665
00:42:15,935 --> 00:42:16,447
specifically.

666
00:42:20,031 --> 00:42:26,175
After all, it becomes a value scale, what is it that matters and what does nothing mean?

667
00:42:26,431 --> 00:42:28,991
If I am going to pick something out of this then I thought

668
00:42:29,247 --> 00:42:32,319
The girl's relationship with the cows, to the animals.

669
00:42:32,831 --> 00:42:34,111
Would you like to comment

670
00:42:34,367 --> 00:42:35,903
Something about that?

671
00:42:37,183 --> 00:42:40,255
For it had deep roots in a tradition, how

672
00:42:40,767 --> 00:42:41,791
The animals are treated.

673
00:42:56,127 --> 00:42:59,967
It is such a big question that I have to think how I start ...

674
00:43:03,295 --> 00:43:05,599
Just how to how you treat the cow?

675
00:43:06,367 --> 00:43:08,415
It is very important,

676
00:43:08,927 --> 00:43:13,279
Everything she says is very important in this book.

677
00:43:17,119 --> 00:43:20,959
If I think about relationships with nature ...

678
00:43:21,215 --> 00:43:27,359
First I can tell you a little about that girl.
 When I wrote the book and looked at the world

679
00:43:28,383 --> 00:43:34,271
with that girl's eyes that is 13-14 years old,

680
00:43:34,783 --> 00:43:39,903
Which is very eager, who want to know about life.

681
00:43:40,415 --> 00:43:45,535
She wants to know about everything that happens everything that has happened.

682
00:43:46,559 --> 00:43:48,607
She is full of

683
00:43:48,863 --> 00:43:54,239
eenergy and she is full of the joy of life

684
00:43:54,495 --> 00:43:59,871
Although she is in liver in such strange

685
00:44:00,383 --> 00:44:02,943
situations.

686
00:44:03,199 --> 00:44:05,247
But she is not without hope,

687
00:44:05,503 --> 00:44:11,391
she is like the person who knows how to live

688
00:44:11,647 --> 00:44:13,695
in nature,

689
00:44:13,951 --> 00:44:15,743
How to live

690
00:44:15,999 --> 00:44:18,815
together with animals.

691
00:44:22,655 --> 00:44:27,775
She thinks she is part of nature

692
00:44:28,031 --> 00:44:29,567
Like the trees,

693
00:44:30,079 --> 00:44:33,663
Like the earth, as well as the air,

694
00:44:33,919 --> 00:44:36,223
Like all flowers.

695
00:44:37,503 --> 00:44:38,015
So she

696
00:44:38,271 --> 00:44:41,599
does not have a relationship

697
00:44:41,855 --> 00:44:42,879
to nature,

698
00:44:43,391 --> 00:44:45,695
She is part of nature.

699
00:44:45,951 --> 00:44:48,835
Like we are actually.

700
00:44:49,023 --> 00:44:50,559
When we think that

701
00:44:51,327 --> 00:44:52,863
We all people

702
00:44:53,119 --> 00:44:54,655
are animals too.

703
00:44:55,167 --> 00:44:59,263
We often forget it

704
00:44:59,263 --> 00:45:01,055
But we are animals.

705
00:45:02,335 --> 00:45:04,639
Like chimpanzees are

706
00:45:04,895 --> 00:45:05,919
ours

707
00:45:06,175 --> 00:45:08,991
closest

708
00:45:11,295 --> 00:45:12,319
relatives.

709
00:45:12,831 --> 00:45:14,367
So we're an animal.

710
00:45:15,135 --> 00:45:17,951
And we are part of nature.

711
00:45:18,719 --> 00:45:20,767
For when we think about

712
00:45:21,023 --> 00:45:26,911
human history and the history of our planet

713
00:45:28,191 --> 00:45:28,959
Was it

714
00:45:29,471 --> 00:45:32,031
millions of years

715
00:45:32,287 --> 00:45:36,127
Before we humans came here on the planet.

716
00:45:37,407 --> 00:45:38,687
And we forget that.

717
00:45:39,455 --> 00:45:43,295
The planet was here and there was no man here.

718
00:45:44,063 --> 00:45:45,343
And then we came.

719
00:45:45,855 --> 00:45:48,671
And we made the planet what we see now.

720
00:45:50,207 --> 00:45:56,351
When one thinks of man's history

721
00:45:56,863 --> 00:46:01,727
Before we started growing the earth,

722
00:46:02,495 --> 00:46:06,079
All the people here on the planet were

723
00:46:06,335 --> 00:46:07,871
Hunters and collectors.

724
00:46:09,151 --> 00:46:11,711
And we worked

725
00:46:13,503 --> 00:46:15,295
four hours a day

726
00:46:15,551 --> 00:46:19,446
To get heat and food.

727
00:46:19,647 --> 00:46:21,183
Four hours a day

728
00:46:22,207 --> 00:46:23,748
And not every day.

729
00:46:23,999 --> 00:46:33,983
And we could live that way for the 100,000 years.

730
00:46:33,983 --> 00:46:35,519
We lived that way.

731
00:46:36,031 --> 00:46:39,103
And with the lifestyle that we have now

732
00:46:39,359 --> 00:46:43,455
Have we lived only a small part of the time.

733
00:46:44,223 --> 00:46:48,416
10,000 years ago we started growing.

734
00:46:48,831 --> 00:46:53,183
And big cities and this lifestyle

735
00:46:53,439 --> 00:46:55,999
have been here a little more than

736
00:46:56,255 --> 00:46:57,279
100 years!

737
00:46:58,303 --> 00:47:00,607
And all that can disappear,

738
00:47:01,631 --> 00:47:02,655
We have to think about that

739
00:47:06,495 --> 00:47:08,287
It's as little time as

740
00:47:08,799 --> 00:47:10,591
Man has been here

741
00:47:10,847 --> 00:47:15,711
And the whole human race can die away.

742
00:47:21,599 --> 00:47:27,743
And then nature and all animals take over the planet.

743
00:47:29,279 --> 00:47:33,119
If we continue to live this way like that

744
00:47:35,167 --> 00:47:39,007
will people die away.

745
00:47:39,007 --> 00:47:41,823
In this book I wanted to

746
00:47:43,359 --> 00:47:45,407
treat this thing

747
00:47:46,175 --> 00:47:50,015
but in the way I describe

748
00:47:50,527 --> 00:47:53,343
How human can live

749
00:47:54,623 --> 00:47:56,159
in balance

750
00:47:56,671 --> 00:47:58,207
with the entire globe,

751
00:47:58,975 --> 00:48:10,765
all animals, all species

752
00:48:11,007 --> 00:48:15,359
How we can live here with all other animal species

753
00:48:18,181 --> 00:48:25,855
In balance like the girl does.

754
00:48:25,855 --> 00:48:32,255
If one lives on the same level as all other species

755
00:48:33,279 --> 00:48:34,559
As we can live here,

756
00:48:34,815 --> 00:48:35,583
very nice.

757
00:48:36,095 --> 00:48:36,863
It goes.

758
00:48:38,911 --> 00:48:40,703
We usually say that

759
00:48:40,959 --> 00:48:45,311
Nowadays, people are like that

760
00:48:45,567 --> 00:48:48,895
up in the head that

761
00:48:49,407 --> 00:48:51,967
they cannot live here

762
00:48:52,223 --> 00:48:56,063
Without all these machines,

763
00:48:56,319 --> 00:48:58,623
Digital world and whatever.

764
00:48:59,135 --> 00:49:00,415
But it is not true.

765
00:49:01,183 --> 00:49:03,999
If the digital world collapses,

766
00:49:04,255 --> 00:49:06,815
it takes two vecor

767
00:49:06,815 --> 00:49:09,119
And all people can live here.

768
00:49:09,887 --> 00:49:15,007
If the fire disappears we can live after two weeks, it goes well

769
00:49:18,335 --> 00:49:18,847
Man as a species

770
00:49:19,359 --> 00:49:22,431
is very flexible.

771
00:49:26,271 --> 00:49:27,039
It's going well.

772
00:49:33,183 --> 00:49:36,511
So I'm not afraid of

773
00:49:37,023 --> 00:49:38,047
The future.

774
00:49:40,607 --> 00:49:44,447
The digital world and if it comes like anything,

775
00:49:45,727 --> 00:49:47,007
if we want

776
00:49:47,263 --> 00:49:48,287
Can we live here.

777
00:49:49,823 --> 00:49:50,591
Right!

778
00:49:50,591 --> 00:49:54,943
Here I think it would fit well if we would read a bit if it's okay for you

779
00:49:56,991 --> 00:49:58,783
This girl

780
00:49:59,295 --> 00:50:01,599
develops during the course of the journey

781
00:50:01,599 --> 00:50:09,208
And the place we should read from is about when she in her way meets love

782
00:50:09,208 --> 00:50:10,870
for the first time

783
00:50:10,870 --> 00:50:16,715
but also her way of relate to what is happening

784
00:50:16,715 --> 00:50:19,561
In a human being when you meet the one you want to be with.

785
00:50:21,311 --> 00:50:22,591
Yes exactly

786
00:50:25,965 --> 00:50:33,957
This is at the end of the novel and it is therefore about

787
00:50:34,188 --> 00:50:40,480
The girl who has come back to her farm and an uncle who takes care of the yard

788
00:50:40,767 --> 00:50:42,559
After the father has fallen.

789
00:50:44,607 --> 00:50:50,751
Uncle had taken a boy who seemed to be proper a thick -nest bay with rash in

790
00:50:51,007 --> 00:50:52,799
The face I had not seen before.

791
00:50:53,567 --> 00:50:57,890
He asked if I wanted to go out into the woods and look for taxes

792
00:50:58,647 --> 00:51:02,783
The bay went ahead and I after.
 I looked at his wide backboard.

793
00:51:03,039 --> 00:51:07,391
We roam in the forest and in the afternoon we found to hide.

794
00:51:09,695 --> 00:51:12,767
We started digging by hand, for pots, boilers, copper, barrels and glasses

795
00:51:13,023 --> 00:51:17,887
Which was buried in the woodland and from the rapids we salvaged a service.

796
00:51:17,887 --> 00:51:20,703
We bent in the ditch that ran out of cold source

797
00:51:20,959 --> 00:51:26,079
Where Dad had hidden a quarter.
 In it was the vase Grandma had received in the dowry

798
00:51:26,079 --> 00:51:28,127
and grandmother's engagement gifts,

799
00:51:28,383 --> 00:51:31,711
A coffee pot of silver, cream and sugar bowl.

800
00:51:40,927 --> 00:51:43,743
He had smile pits and his hand felt good.

801
00:51:44,767 --> 00:51:47,071
We walked along Skogsvägen to the lake.

802
00:51:47,327 --> 00:51:52,768
The water chuckled and sparkled.
 The swallows piled here and there, very close to the surface,

803
00:51:52,959 --> 00:51:58,557
caught short and long night dragonflies in the beak and swung back up into the blue sky

804
00:51:58,557 --> 00:52:01,919
I jerked when the bay put my hand on my shoulder,

805
00:52:01,919 --> 00:52:03,199
hugged hard about it,

806
00:52:04,991 --> 00:52:07,039
Folded me on my back and rolled over on me.

807
00:52:07,551 --> 00:52:11,903
A shoal small fish swam around in my stomach and constantly changed the direction.

808
00:52:12,159 --> 00:52:16,767
The lungs are on fire, the heart fluttered like a summer curtain in an open window.

809
00:52:17,279 --> 00:52:22,399
I thought now is the right time and pressed lips against his rough lips,

810
00:52:22,655 --> 00:52:24,703
Did he licked sweaty face,

811
00:52:24,959 --> 00:52:28,031
he tickled smile pits and white teeth with my tongue.

812
00:52:28,287 --> 00:52:29,567
He my cheeks.

813
00:52:30,079 --> 00:52:37,247
My stupid arms felt the curled hair on his arms.
 I brought my pants down and opened the buttons in his.

814
00:52:37,247 --> 00:52:43,391
He penetrated into my damp pussy and it splashed and irritated in my toes and fingertips.
 Life sprinkled in the mouth.

815
00:52:43,647 --> 00:52:45,183
I screamed like a pig.

816
00:52:45,951 --> 00:52:50,815
It felt like the lungs were emptied of air and I fell hover like the leaf from the tree.

817
00:52:50,815 --> 00:52:53,997
He sprayed the liquids into my interior.

818
00:52:53,997 --> 00:53:00,799
I grabbed his head and pushed it down in my wrote and he started licking.
 My leather pounded satisfied.

819
00:53:00,799 --> 00:53:09,616
We lay next to each other, we giggled and let lice flies and mosquito suck blood out of the throat and forest locks run over our faces.

820
00:53:09,616 --> 00:53:14,111
Then we were silent.
 I looked at his mouth, forehead and clear eyes.

821
00:53:14,623 --> 00:53:16,159
We were lying side by side,

822
00:53:16,415 --> 00:53:17,183
close together,

823
00:53:17,439 --> 00:53:18,719
breasts against breasts,

824
00:53:18,975 --> 00:53:19,999
without words.

825
00:53:20,511 --> 00:53:23,583
And the feeling of joy pulsed all the way into the nails.

826
00:53:29,727 --> 00:53:37,222
Yes, yeah, okay.
 Now let's take it at Meänkiel as well.

827
00:53:37,222 --> 00:53:40,358
I have talked that time goes on, so

828
00:53:40,531 --> 00:53:44,831
I read a little here in the beginning.

829
00:53:46,111 --> 00:53:51,487
Ko Mie Ja Katri Olima Koalla Urakalla Saahneet Kyörrettyä Karjan Maantiele,

830
00:53:51,487 --> 00:53:59,229
Taivas Peitty Syksyssen Utuharssoon ja kohta alcohol tihuutahmaan jäähilheistä Vettä.

831
00:53:59,423 --> 00:54:04,543
Kaikki muut lenti Paitti ilona pöästyit teräviä hiutahleita ja haijaanuit.

832
00:54:05,137 --> 00:54:11,930
Sisko, Pirkko Ja Liina Rynnit Ojjaa Pitkin, Kerttu Reistasi Paeta Methään,

833
00:54:12,223 --> 00:54:16,831
Siskon Eeliskuussa vision news Sokkerivasikka Tanssi Paikahlaan,

834
00:54:17,599 --> 00:54:20,927
Soma Kiipesi Kielon Sölkhään Yes Molemat Rääyit.

835
00:54:21,695 --> 00:54:27,839
Reunassa Oli Kuiteski niin tiheä marked ja mustaa onei ker

836
00:54:40,895 --> 00:54:45,503
We have to start rounding here but maybe there is someone who wants to ask questions?

837
00:54:46,783 --> 00:54:47,551
So you get ...

838
00:54:51,391 --> 00:54:53,695
The language is meänkieli

839
00:54:53,951 --> 00:54:55,487
or Tornedals dialect.

840
00:54:55,743 --> 00:54:57,023
The whole book.

841
00:54:57,791 --> 00:55:03,935
But Janina is such an amazing translator that she can like

842
00:55:04,703 --> 00:55:05,983
Make it too.

843
00:55:07,775 --> 00:55:08,543
Thank you yes> "

844
00:55:10,079 --> 00:55:10,591
More?

845
00:55:23,903 --> 00:55:29,535
The original is at Meänkieli and the assignment was to translate it into Swedish, not into another dialect.

846
00:55:30,303 --> 00:55:36,447
I can't translate to another dialect because I know no dialect so good that I can write it on it.

847
00:55:39,007 --> 00:55:40,031
Then i have thought like that

848
00:55:40,287 --> 00:55:42,591
that I try to catch the rhythm

849
00:55:43,103 --> 00:55:45,151
In the original as good as possible.

850
00:55:45,663 --> 00:55:50,271
Of course you should include the message too, but it should float in your own rhythm.

851
00:55:52,063 --> 00:55:54,623
Yes simply so ...

852
00:55:56,927 --> 00:56:00,511
Any of you may have read the translations of

853
00:56:01,279 --> 00:56:02,815
Väinö Linnas "Unknown Soldier"

854
00:56:03,583 --> 00:56:04,351
to Swedish?

855
00:56:04,607 --> 00:56:08,191
And that is, as always, this question with dialect?
 What to do with the dialect?

856
00:56:08,959 --> 00:56:11,775
For a dialect is not equal to another dialect.

857
00:56:12,287 --> 00:56:15,103
So it's pretty complicated.

858
00:56:15,103 --> 00:56:18,943
But you write in such a way that even if it is meänkieli

859
00:56:19,711 --> 00:56:23,039
So I hear in my head that here he was told me in Swedish.

860
00:56:24,063 --> 00:56:25,855
I don't know how it goes but ...

861
00:56:27,135 --> 00:56:29,695
She knows me so well!

862
00:56:29,951 --> 00:56:33,023
We have known each other for 20 years

863
00:56:43,775 --> 00:56:47,615
"The Supreme" is also on Meänkieli

864
00:56:47,871 --> 00:56:55,298
Coupbee No. 6 is in original in Finnish

865
00:56:55,298 --> 00:57:00,159
These are short stories that are also translated into Swedish.

866
00:57:01,183 --> 00:57:07,327
Such short stories that I wrote before I started writing novels.

867
00:57:08,863 --> 00:57:11,935
I was 50 years old when I started,

868
00:57:12,191 --> 00:57:13,727
not 50 years,

869
00:57:13,983 --> 00:57:18,591
I was 40 years old when I started writing novels.

870
00:57:19,871 --> 00:57:21,407
But I write

871
00:57:21,919 --> 00:57:25,503
Nowadays, short stories.

872
00:57:26,015 --> 00:57:29,343
Most to actors.

873
00:57:31,391 --> 00:57:32,415
Monologists

874
00:57:32,671 --> 00:57:34,961
to actors.

875
00:57:44,959 --> 00:57:49,567
If you have written about your life in Russia and in Denmark and in the US

876
00:57:49,823 --> 00:57:58,783
Yes, I have written about my life in Russia, Kupé # 6 which is the novel and also the movie.

877
00:57:58,783 --> 00:58:04,927
So it is from my own life that and my first

878
00:58:05,183 --> 00:58:08,511
Trans -Siberian journey that I did

879
00:58:09,279 --> 00:58:11,071
null

880
00:58:11,327 --> 00:58:13,631
First year with gorbatov

881
00:58:14,911 --> 00:58:21,055
Now I work with the book about Texas

882
00:58:21,823 --> 00:58:27,199
But I don't know when it comes out,

883
00:58:28,735 --> 00:58:31,295
not in the next few years

884
00:58:31,551 --> 00:58:34,623
For now I travel a lot with this one

885
00:58:35,391 --> 00:58:37,695
"The river" and I want to concentrate

886
00:58:37,951 --> 00:58:41,791
on the book when it comes out in different countries.

887
00:58:42,303 --> 00:58:48,447
It's my work now but my head is working on

888
00:58:48,703 --> 00:58:49,727
America.

889
00:58:50,239 --> 00:58:52,543
But we will see that how it goes.

890
00:58:56,383 --> 00:59:01,247
But Denmark, yes Denmark!
 I have never written anything about

891
00:59:01,503 --> 00:59:04,319
Christiania but i have been thinking

892
00:59:04,575 --> 00:59:06,879
Make a documentary there.

893
00:59:07,135 --> 00:59:09,439
And I have, like starting

894
00:59:09,695 --> 00:59:13,791
Talk to my friends who have said they

895
00:59:14,047 --> 00:59:16,863
Who lives in Christiania now.

896
00:59:17,119 --> 00:59:19,423
Also my old friends

897
00:59:19,679 --> 00:59:22,239
Have promised that they will come.

898
00:59:25,823 --> 00:59:27,871
Now I have made a document film about Marjatta Nenander

899
00:59:28,383 --> 00:59:33,503
who is my Swedish gallerist from Stockholm and she is a

900
00:59:33,759 --> 00:59:35,807
Person in this book.

901
00:59:36,831 --> 00:59:41,695
So i made an hour documentary about her

902
00:59:41,951 --> 00:59:43,743
Refugee story.

903
00:59:44,255 --> 00:59:48,351
And her whole story is very interesting.

904
00:59:48,607 --> 00:59:50,911
And now

905
00:59:51,167 --> 00:59:54,239
I work with Pauli's documentary film.

906
00:59:55,775 --> 01:00:01,407
I have filmed everything and now it is haircut.

907
01:00:03,711 --> 01:00:09,855
But I think Christiania comes on documentary films and not

908
01:00:10,623 --> 01:00:11,647
in book form.

909
01:00:17,791 --> 01:00:18,815
Yes I did.

910
01:00:19,071 --> 01:00:21,887
I traveled alone

911
01:00:22,143 --> 01:00:26,495
twice with the Trans -Siberian railway.

912
01:00:26,751 --> 01:00:30,591
But the third time followed my

913
01:00:30,847 --> 01:00:33,919
17-year-old daughter with.

914
01:00:34,175 --> 01:00:39,295
Yes we met there.

915
01:00:39,551 --> 01:00:45,695
In Krasnojarsk and Novosibirsk

916
01:00:45,951 --> 01:00:48,511
She and I took the trip

917
01:00:49,023 --> 01:00:51,071
by train.

918
01:00:51,839 --> 01:00:54,911
I told my daughter to,

919
01:00:55,423 --> 01:01:01,567
We fly, it was a book fair,

920
01:01:02,079 --> 01:01:08,223
We fly there!
 She said no, we take the Transiberian train!

921
01:01:08,479 --> 01:01:11,039
So I've done it three times!

922
01:01:11,295 --> 01:01:14,879
But every time it's been awesome

923
01:01:15,135 --> 01:01:16,159
I love

924
01:01:16,415 --> 01:01:18,207
To travel by train

925
01:01:18,463 --> 01:01:23,327
I travel everywhere by train of course it is possible i love

926
01:01:23,583 --> 01:01:24,095
Train

927
01:01:24,607 --> 01:01:25,631
For it

928
01:01:26,143 --> 01:01:30,751
Life is so amazing when in the train

929
01:01:32,031 --> 01:01:34,847
Yes and that and with the Trans -Siberian Railway

930
01:01:35,103 --> 01:01:41,247
Hope that it is someone becomes possible even in our lifetime but what it is so amazing it becomes your own world when you live

931
01:01:46,623 --> 01:01:48,415
And lots of different people

932
01:01:57,887 --> 01:02:01,215
Yes we have seen many have seen a movie

933
01:02:02,495 --> 01:02:04,543
Out number six i was thinking

934
01:02:04,799 --> 01:02:10,687
A brief comment on how to live it and or are there any other of your books that are going on

935
01:02:10,943 --> 01:02:11,455
Cinema

936
01:02:12,735 --> 01:02:17,599
No it is the only one that has made of my bee

937
01:02:18,111 --> 01:02:23,231
Yes I saw the movie for the first time in can the festival in France

938
01:02:23,743 --> 01:02:25,279
It was the premiere there

939
01:02:25,791 --> 01:02:31,167
And I had not been working in the movie and I do not know

940
01:02:31,423 --> 01:02:34,751
Director Juhokåsmannen

941
01:02:36,031 --> 01:02:39,359
Personal but I had seen his films and

942
01:02:40,127 --> 01:02:42,175
I liked a lot

943
01:02:42,431 --> 01:02:42,943
Movies

944
01:02:44,735 --> 01:02:48,575
And when i was there so first

945
01:02:48,831 --> 01:02:54,975
10 minutes I was, like shocks like no

946
01:02:56,255 --> 01:02:57,791
But then like

947
01:02:58,047 --> 01:03:02,399
I lived this whole this movie

948
01:03:02,655 --> 01:03:04,959
So that I didn't think

949
01:03:08,799 --> 01:03:12,127
So like it took me 100 %

950
01:03:13,407 --> 01:03:19,551
So I then started when I have the goose man you can the festival and now we are good friends and

951
01:03:19,807 --> 01:03:23,903
And we noticed in there may the festival that

952
01:03:25,183 --> 01:03:28,767
Chilin sisters themselves

953
01:03:36,447 --> 01:03:41,311
Not friends too okay

954
01:03:41,567 --> 01:03:46,687
But I saw me but the movie I love movie

955
01:03:47,711 --> 01:03:51,807
I've seen a four times now that we round

956
01:03:52,063 --> 01:03:56,159
Round it toured

957
01:03:56,415 --> 01:03:57,695
Turner

958
01:03:57,951 --> 01:03:58,975
With film

959
01:03:59,487 --> 01:04:01,023
In different countries

960
01:04:01,279 --> 01:04:05,631
So i saw it four times and each

961
01:04:05,887 --> 01:04:08,447
It was like another movie to me

962
01:04:08,959 --> 01:04:13,823
For the first time it was like all that since I started

963
01:04:14,079 --> 01:04:18,431
Focus on dialogues then on clothes and

964
01:04:18,687 --> 01:04:20,991
Darke like that so

965
01:04:21,247 --> 01:04:24,831
And then the music and all these sounds and

966
01:04:25,599 --> 01:04:31,487
Looks the lice and such so it was always a new movie

967
01:04:32,511 --> 01:04:33,791
No but that yes recommended

968
01:04:35,583 --> 01:04:37,375
And the book is like its

969
01:04:38,143 --> 01:04:38,911
And the movie is

970
01:04:48,895 --> 01:04:49,663
Warrior

971
01:04:52,223 --> 01:04:57,599
Many books of

972
01:04:58,111 --> 01:05:02,207
That story for what he was such a child

973
01:05:10,911 --> 01:05:11,679
His

974
01:05:11,935 --> 01:05:12,959
Is it clear here

975
01:05:19,615 --> 01:05:21,919
What is it called

976
01:05:23,199 --> 01:05:26,015
Just

977
01:05:26,271 --> 01:05:29,599
The movie is a lot

978
01:05:32,671 --> 01:05:35,487
There were so many children who

979
01:05:37,023 --> 01:05:40,351
Who was also a war child in Denmark.

980
01:05:40,607 --> 01:05:41,631
But

981
01:05:47,263 --> 01:05:49,823
Cake

982
01:05:50,335 --> 01:05:53,663
I think it's called with answers as well

983
01:05:53,919 --> 01:05:58,015
men 50 years old when he wrote the first book about it

984
01:05:58,271 --> 01:06:01,343
As you get older it is easier

985
01:06:02,623 --> 01:06:03,647
The shame is

986
01:06:04,159 --> 01:06:05,695
Of course

987
01:06:06,975 --> 01:06:08,767
that hinders.

988
01:06:11,327 --> 01:06:12,095
I was so curious your stay in Texas, do you want to tell

989
01:06:12,351 --> 01:06:13,375
A little about that?

990
01:06:37,439 --> 01:06:43,071
But it was very interesting.
 It was full of adventure.

991
01:06:43,583 --> 01:06:45,887
You could say that

992
01:06:48,191 --> 01:06:51,263
I want to thank so much for this book about the river

993
01:06:54,079 --> 01:06:57,151
I also believe that one reason for people not

994
01:06:57,407 --> 01:06:59,711
written these stories or told these stories

995
01:07:01,247 --> 01:07:02,015
is that they did not have the language,

996
01:07:02,271 --> 01:07:04,063
That they did not get the language.

997
01:07:04,575 --> 01:07:06,111
My mother came as a four -year -old

998
01:07:06,367 --> 01:07:07,647
And she is not written language.

999
01:07:09,695 --> 01:07:10,719
She is spoken language.

1000
01:07:11,487 --> 01:07:12,255
In Swedish only.

1001
01:07:13,023 --> 01:07:15,839
So that may be a reason.
 But I would like ...

1002
01:07:16,095 --> 01:07:18,143
I hear when you tell us about coupe # 6

1003
01:07:19,167 --> 01:07:23,263
That you might not have the power over the movie

1004
01:07:23,519 --> 01:07:24,799
I would like to ask you

1005
01:07:25,055 --> 01:07:28,895
Whether you live or not when the movie of the river

1006
01:07:29,151 --> 01:07:35,039
Made in the future, that you retain power and say they may not find a name for this girl.

1007
01:07:36,831 --> 01:07:37,855
In order to,

1008
01:07:38,111 --> 01:07:40,415
For example, Margaret Atwood has made a book

1009
01:07:41,439 --> 01:07:44,511
where the main character had no name and

1010
01:07:44,767 --> 01:07:49,375
The film companies have demanded that she get a name and they have said that she is called something.

1011
01:07:50,911 --> 01:07:53,215
Keep in mind that there is a risk that they suddenly

1012
01:07:53,471 --> 01:07:56,799
Just decide that she is called Seja or what she can now be called.

1013
01:07:59,103 --> 01:08:04,735
I keep it in my heart

1014
01:08:06,271 --> 01:08:07,551
But I was still thinking about coupe No. 6

1015
01:08:09,599 --> 01:08:10,111
For

1016
01:08:10,367 --> 01:08:11,903
The girl there

1017
01:08:12,415 --> 01:08:18,993
Have only one replica in the whole novel, the rest is going on in her head.

1018
01:08:18,993 --> 01:08:24,278
We get to know it through her thoughts, it's related ...

1019
01:08:24,959 --> 01:08:25,727
interesting.

1020
01:08:27,263 --> 01:08:29,311
Yes it is.

1021
01:08:33,407 --> 01:08:37,759
I think I'm such a writer

1022
01:08:38,015 --> 01:08:41,599
to the best path

1023
01:08:42,623 --> 01:08:48,767
For me, writing long monologues.

1024
01:08:51,583 --> 01:08:55,423
So that is the reason for that

1025
01:08:55,935 --> 01:08:59,232
I write long monologues.

1026
01:08:59,232 --> 01:09:01,823
You have a very fun explanation for why monologue?

1027
01:09:04,127 --> 01:09:10,271
And that is, I have thought about why I love to write monologues

1028
01:09:11,807 --> 01:09:17,951
It is that in Finland and especially in my hometown

1029
01:09:19,231 --> 01:09:24,351
we usually do not discuss.
 There are no dialogues.

1030
01:09:24,863 --> 01:09:26,143
There are only

1031
01:09:26,399 --> 01:09:28,703
Monologist by monologue.

1032
01:09:28,959 --> 01:09:33,311
You do not discuss.

1033
01:09:39,455 --> 01:09:41,247
It's another culture

1034
01:09:41,503 --> 01:09:46,367
than in Sweden.
 We know that

1035
01:09:46,623 --> 01:09:48,927
Here people discuss

1036
01:09:49,183 --> 01:09:55,327
And when I have lived in Stockholm too and I have Swedish friends,

1037
01:09:55,583 --> 01:09:59,167
especially with gallerist who has been my gallerist

1038
01:09:59,423 --> 01:10:00,447
30 years

1039
01:10:00,959 --> 01:10:07,103
So we are friends and I feel through the gallery

1040
01:10:07,359 --> 01:10:08,895
Lots of people in Stockholm,

1041
01:10:10,175 --> 01:10:13,247
Swedes love to discuss!

1042
01:10:18,367 --> 01:10:22,719
It is something very special for us Finns

1043
01:10:22,975 --> 01:10:25,791
Who sits still and thinks.

1044
01:10:36,287 --> 01:10:36,799
Thanks

1045
01:10:37,311 --> 01:10:38,079
because you have listened

1046
01:10:42,687 --> 01:10:48,831
Thank you to everyone for coming here and

1047
01:10:50,367 --> 01:10:51,647
It was so fun to talk here!

1048
01:10:54,719 --> 01:10:57,535
And nice audience!

1049
01:10:57,791 --> 01:10:58,815
Thousand thanks

1050
01:10:59,327 --> 01:11:02,143
And see you in the future!
