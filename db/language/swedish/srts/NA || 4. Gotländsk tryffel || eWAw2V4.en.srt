1
00:00:01.400 --> 00:00:04.760
-Look there!
 -Good!
 Very good!

2
00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:09.400
It is important to be quick and catch them before the dog scratches them.

3
00:00:09.560 --> 00:00:11.240
It was fine.

4
00:00:22.120 --> 00:00:25.360
Many may have visited Gotland during the summer

5
00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:28.560
But it's actually nice here in the fall.

6
00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:34.160
In addition, it is high season for the small delicate Gotland truffle.

7
00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:03.920
Here in Norrlanda, in the middle of Gotland, Luqaz runs a restaurant

8
00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:06.000
In a small glass cabin.

9
00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:10.760
Together we will cook a feast for some lovely islanders.

10
00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:14.240
But first I will try to get out of the fence here ...

11
00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:21.880
Right next to Luqaz restaurant is growing truffles.

12
00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:25.560
Luqaz has put together a bunch that will help us look.

13
00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:32.080
In addition to the landowners, it is with a real truffle expert.

14
00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:34.920
- This was a nice glade.
 -Really.

15
00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:38.080
Here we have the oak with which the truffle grows together.

16
00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:41.440
Here we will see if we can find a little.

17
00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:43.680
In Gotland, several kinds of truffles grow.

18
00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:46.560
But it is the one called Burgundy, or Gotland truffle

19
00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:48.680
which you use for cooking.

20
00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:54.320
Truffle has probably been on Gotland evenly but 20 years ago it became known.

21
00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:59.040
The one who discovered it was no less than our truffle guide Christina.

22
00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:04.400
The very first truffle I found before there were truffle dogs here

23
00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:08.400
I did by crawling on all fours and feeling on the ground.

24
00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:10.800
I felt that it was failing differently in one place

25
00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:14.000
And I thought, "Could it be something here?"

26
00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:18.400
Then I peeled away and saw the knotty, black surface.

27
00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:22.840
The truffle is just below the moss under the oak where I am.

28
00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:26.680
Then I get up the truffle and it weighs almost a quarter of a kilo.

29
00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:32.160
Never ever afterwards have I found an equal truffle, despite dogs!

30
00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:41.440
- Is she something going on?
 - Search, Polly.
 Wait, may I see?

31
00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:45.120
Yes, what good!
 Now let's see here.

32
00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:53.480
Look, here it is!
 Sometimes they can lie so superficially.

33
00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:57.280
- Acient, Polly.
 - Here is the first little truffle.

34
00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:07.160
The truffle grows below the ground and to spread their spores

35
00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:09.680
it uses the sense of smell of animals.

36
00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:12.200
The strong scent attracts animals eating it

37
00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:14.760
and then spreads with its stool.

38
00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:17.960
To find the truffle, specially trained dogs are used.

39
00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:21.640
Mainly Italian truffle dogs, but also Christina's spaniel

40
00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:24.120
Has a well -developed truffle nose.

41
00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:31.360
Good!
 Very good!

42
00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:36.200
It is important to be quick and catch them before the dog scratches them.

43
00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:38.440
It was fine.

44
00:03:54.240 --> 00:03:57.160
We are going to cook dinner on this.

45
00:03:57.320 --> 00:04:02.680
What should we drive to?
 How should we build this ...?

46
00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:08.160
I think it's fun to combine the luxurious truffle

47
00:04:08.320 --> 00:04:15.400
With raw materials that do not feel as luxurious - such as cabbage, onion, potatoes and eggs.

48
00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:21.120
Quite cheap ingredients, but they fit very well with truffles.

49
00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:25.760
Especially if you add the best friend of the truffle:

50
00:04:25.920 --> 00:04:29.280
- fat of different kinds.
 - fat in all forms.

51
00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:31.400
Yes that's how it is.

52
00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:40.000
The truffle is washed and we pull to the vegetable grower to botanize.

53
00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:48.840
It feels luxurious, I think, to be able to harvest in November.

54
00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:54.520
Really, it's super nice.
 They are almost the sweetest now too.

55
00:04:54.680 --> 00:04:57.320
- The little frostbone does ... - precise.

56
00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:11.560
Should we see what we got with us?

57
00:05:11.720 --> 00:05:17.240
Here was the lovely kale.

58
00:05:17.400 --> 00:05:18.960
Nice leeks ...

59
00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:21.600
This is fun - if you have never seen Brussels sprouts.

60
00:05:21.760 --> 00:05:27.240
Yes, it grows so exciting.
 It is hardly believed that it is for real.

61
00:05:27.400 --> 00:05:29.520
Here we also have the world's largest beta.

62
00:05:29.680 --> 00:05:32.960
It probably won't be so nice but we do a test

63
00:05:33.120 --> 00:05:35.400
So we see if it is too woody or can be eaten.

64
00:05:35.560 --> 00:05:38.360
It's fun with big vegetables.

65
00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:44.120
It will be very green.
 The beetroot is allowed to go into the oven at low temperature

66
00:05:44.280 --> 00:05:46.560
and my plan is to make a potato dish

67
00:05:46.720 --> 00:05:54.160
With butter -fried potatoes, hot cheese cream topped with a shock of deep -fried potatoes.

68
00:05:54.320 --> 00:05:56.600
Luqaz works with different kinds of cabbage

69
00:05:56.760 --> 00:06:00.760
And a pork that he boils in beer on the grill.

70
00:06:03.680 --> 00:06:06.200
- This is so good.
 -Yes.

71
00:06:15.800 --> 00:06:20.880
I have been inspired by walking around the fields and seeing what is growing.

72
00:06:21.040 --> 00:06:24.120
That's how I think, "What should I cook next?"

73
00:06:24.280 --> 00:06:28.760
I am more inspired by farmers and producers than by other chefs.

74
00:06:31.440 --> 00:06:37.640
The huge beetroot got better than we thought, so it goes with it.

75
00:06:37.800 --> 00:06:41.840
But it's time to start posting, because the guests fall in.

76
00:06:46.520 --> 00:06:50.480
We have used the truffle as a flavoring in different ways in the dishes.

77
00:06:50.640 --> 00:06:52.840
But the most luxurious when having fresh truffles

78
00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:58.040
is to tear or slice it directly over the food right by serving.

79
00:06:58.200 --> 00:07:03.000
-What do you think?
 Should we ... - we drive.
 It looks great.

80
00:07:05.440 --> 00:07:07.680
Here we have it: Truffle dinner.

81
00:07:07.840 --> 00:07:11.120
In the little bowl you have a potato and onion serving

82
00:07:11.280 --> 00:07:16.520
With hot cheese cream, planed truffle and crispy potatoes.

83
00:07:16.680 --> 00:07:23.360
Then you have a small main course: grilled lace bowl, broccoli

84
00:07:23.520 --> 00:07:29.160
slightly crispy kale and a beer -browned pork, a truffle cream

85
00:07:29.320 --> 00:07:33.560
And so we have a big, nice beetroot that we found, which we have baked.

86
00:07:33.720 --> 00:07:37.560
- We cut a thin disc at the bottom.
 -Please enjoy!

87
00:07:39.960 --> 00:07:42.560
- Fantastic.
 --Wow!

88
00:07:42.720 --> 00:07:45.000
-Very tasty.
 - Was it?

89
00:07:45.160 --> 00:07:50.160
There were so many wonderful textures in this little bowl as well.

90
00:07:50.320 --> 00:07:52.840
The beta was damn lovely.

91
00:07:54.600 --> 00:07:58.080
Do you know the taste of the Norrlandatruffeln?

92
00:08:22.120 --> 00:08:25.000
