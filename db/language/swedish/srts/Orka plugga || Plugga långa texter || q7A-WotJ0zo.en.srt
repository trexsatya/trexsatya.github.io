1
00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:04,440
Do you have several chapters to read before the test and can't even start?

2
00:00:04,600 --> 00:00:08,920
Here are some strategies to add when reading long texts.

3
00:00:10,600 --> 00:00:15,600
Browse the pages, read all the headlines and look at all the pictures.

4
00:00:15,760 --> 00:00:20,760
Read the captions.
 Italic text is often some type of summary.

5
00:00:20,920 --> 00:00:25,720
Is it a whole book?
 Read the back.
 Do you know anything in the subject since before?

6
00:00:25,880 --> 00:00:29,600
Are there ways to get more understanding?

7
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:35,160
For example, a movie on the subject or any shorter article to read.

8
00:00:35,320 --> 00:00:40,800
The understanding gives the brain something to hook up the new information.

9
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:43,360
It makes it easier to remember.

10
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:47,960
Do not read several hours in a row.

11
00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:52,920
Put a clock in five minutes and read concentrated.
 Late time.

12
00:00:53,080 --> 00:00:57,880
If you read half-focused for an hour, you can easily lose yourself in the text-

13
00:00:58,040 --> 00:01:02,840
-And must read about several times.
 Five focused minutes give more.

14
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:06,360
I put the timer in five minutes.

15
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:11,760
One mistake many make is to read the text over and over again.

16
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:16,520
When in the end it feels familiar, you think you can and understand.

17
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:20,560
Divide the text into pieces.
 Take one piece at a time.

18
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:23,680
When the paragraph is complete, beat the book-

19
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:27,040
-And see if you can explain what you read.

20
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:30,760
An easy way to check if you understand.

21
00:01:30,920 --> 00:01:36,160
Write summaries.
 Look for keywords and explain in your own words.

22
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:40,520
Is something complicated?
 Draw an image that explains the text.

23
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:43,880
If you are going to explain how photosynthesis function-

24
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:47,840
-Rit a picture and explain to someone what you have drawn.

25
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,000
A good way to explain relationships.

26
00:01:51,160 --> 00:01:54,760
It is good to plug longer texts with someone.

27
00:01:54,920 --> 00:01:59,320
Read for five minutes, discuss what you have read and take breaks.

28
00:01:59,480 --> 00:02:04,000
Have you perceived the same things?
 Can your friend explain better?

29
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:10,720
Your discussions make it easier for the brain to remember what you have read.

30
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:14,280
You can also hold less presentations-

31
00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:17,040
-The each side or each chapter.

32
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:23,000
Then you want to understand what you are talking about, which is cruel for the test.
