00:00:01,960 --> 00:00:08,840
When talking about proteins you usually think of food such as meat and egg-

2
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:16,320
-But rarely do we talk about the thousands of proteins that build our bodies.

3
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:19,760
Without them we would not exist.

4
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:29,240
There are several thousand protein in the body.

5
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:35,760
They are called the body's building blocks as they build up bones, tissues and muscles-

6
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:40,600
-But even hormones, enzymes and antibodies are proteins.

7
00:00:40,760 --> 00:00:43,040
They are found everywhere in the body-

8
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:47,840
-And is of great importance for the body's functions and structure.

9
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:53,440
The proteins are produced in the body's cells, more specifically the ribosomes-

10
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:56,200
-cellen's small factories.

11
00:00:56,360 --> 00:01:00,200
It is our DNA, our library in Cell nuclei-

12
00:01:00,360 --> 00:01:06,120
-Whow sends out recipes for the type of protein to be manufactured.

13
00:01:06,280 --> 00:01:11,040
It is this process we call protein synthesis.

14
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:15,720
Protein consists of even smaller building blocks, small organic molecules-

15
00:01:15,880 --> 00:01:18,720
-which is called amino acids.

16
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:22,920
There are 20 different ones.

17
00:01:23,080 --> 00:01:28,880
With instructions from the body's DNA, they are linked to long chains.

18
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:32,280
The protein gets specific properties-

19
00:01:32,440 --> 00:01:38,200
-Dore depending on which amino acids are involved and their order.

20
00:01:38,360 --> 00:01:42,800
The combinations are almost endless.

21
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:49,560
When the chain is done, it is folded together and the protein gets its unique structure.

22
00:01:49,720 --> 00:01:55,320
In order for protein to be formed, the amino acids must be found in our bodies.

23
00:01:55,480 --> 00:02:02,240
We cannot make all ourselves.
 We get nine pieces through the food.

24
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:07,320
In the past, it was believed that proteins were unique to a specific tissue.

25
00:02:07,480 --> 00:02:11,760
That they were just there.
 But that theory is littered.

26
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:18,360
Today we know that a protein in the knee joint may be in your gut.

27
00:02:18,520 --> 00:02:25,040
Proteins are not just building materials in tissues, muscles and bones.

28
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:31,480
They are much more than that and are behind many chemical processes.

29
00:02:31,640 --> 00:02:37,160
Enzymes, receptors, hormones and antibodies are all protein-

30
00:02:37,320 --> 00:02:42,120
-And has a role in our cell communication and interaction.

31
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:48,640
Hormones are formed in glands and transported to different organ-

32
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:52,760
-Where they affect different cells.

33
00:02:52,920 --> 00:02:57,920
Receptors are protein that captures external signals-

34
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:00,800
-And sends them into the cell.

35
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:05,720
Antibodies Flag marks intruders in the body-

36
00:03:05,880 --> 00:03:10,080
-and calls on the immune system's killer cells-

37
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:13,960
-What breaks down the unwelcome guest.

38
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:18,040
The function of the enzyme is to catalyze-

39
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:22,520
-It wants to say regulate the speed of different processes.

40
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:28,200
As an example, the enzyme amylas may speed up the decomposition of the food-

41
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:31,040
-What it reaches our intestines.

42
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:37,200
And the enzyme PRDM2 is involved in regulating impulses in our brain.

43
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:43,160
They are very important for processes that can otherwise take hours or days.

44
00:03:43,320 --> 00:03:48,320
They are shortened thanks to our enzymes.
 What can we learn from this?

45
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:52,400
Without proteins, we would not exist.

46
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:58,680
If the cells fail to produce sufficient amounts, the body is affected.

47
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:03,680
If you have a lack of growth hormone you do not grow normally-

48
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:09,320
-And if you have a lack of insulin, you develop the disease diabetes.

49
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:24,480
