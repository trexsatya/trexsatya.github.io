1
00:00:14,740 --> 00:00:16,200
What ifâ€¦

2
00:00:16,200 --> 00:00:17,260
... that farmer saw ...

3
00:00:18,680 --> 00:00:20,880
... what Dad was looking for.

4
00:00:22,040 --> 00:00:23,416
Who took him.

5
00:00:26,700 --> 00:00:28,550
You are a dot from ending up at a youth institution.

6
00:00:28,550 --> 00:00:30,400
Should you start hanging out with those fools again?

7
00:00:32,450 --> 00:00:34,220
At least they believe in me.

8
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:37,600
Dad calculated that there is something out there.

9
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:40,100
He knew exactly where and when the phenomenon would end up here.

10
00:00:45,350 --> 00:00:46,400
Do you have any plan?

11
00:00:51,180 --> 00:00:52,300
It is absolutely incredible.

12
00:00:54,250 --> 00:00:55,100
Jump in!

13
00:00:56,540 --> 00:00:57,760
Want to know a home run?

14
00:00:59,950 --> 00:01:01,400
I don't think we're alone.
