00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:40.200
And the man, the myth, our host Ahmed Berhan!

11
00:00:41.560 --> 00:00:46.720
Welcome to Season 2 of IFS, your favorite program's favorite program.

12
00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:50.920
My name is 00 00 Ahmed Berhan, with a license to program.

13
00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:54.800
These are our fantastic competitors.

14
00:00:55.640 --> 00:00:58.800
Next to me we have Carola.

15
00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:03.560
Next to none other than Niklas.

16
00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:07.120
And rips orange: Christian.

17
00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:14.440
The competition goes like this: You choose one in the panel that gives you an answer.

18
00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:18.760
Then you decide whether their answer is true or false.

19
00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:21.720
We start with you, Christian.

20
00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:24.800
Doesn't he look like Kratos, though with anorexia?

21
00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:27.120
It's just the arrow.

22
00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:31.640
Good of War, though he forgot the muscles at home.

23
00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:35.600
Great fun to have you here, Christian.
 Who do you want to talk to?

24
00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:39.760
Decision anxiety.
 I'm in love with both Filip and Elaf.

25
00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:45.720
- Filip has a little too much beard.
 - The man, your beard is blatte!

26
00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:50.400
You don't know how much beard Elaf has either.

27
00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:55.440
-Elaf?
 –Yes.

28
00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:04.840
They only have fake marks there.
 They do not have adidas, they have Adibas.

29
00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:11.720
The truth is that the letter P is not in the Arabic alphabet.

30
00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:15.560
So then they say B instead.

31
00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:19.520
Police become Bolis, French fries.

32
00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:23.640
When searching for porn they search for drill.

33
00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:28.320
Harcore drill, lesbian drill ... so.

34
00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:33.320
It could be true, but I don't believe it.

35
00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:36.320
- You think she is lying to you?
 -Yes.

36
00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:41.760
Unfortunately, Christian.
 It's true.
 No point for you this time.

37
00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:47.280
P is not found in the Arabic alphabet.
 P can easily become B for Arabic speakers.

38
00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:52.840
- Carola, who do you choose to talk to?
 - I think I'm starting with Thanos.

39
00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:56.880
- What happens, Ahmed?
 –What happens, Thanos?

40
00:02:57.040 --> 00:03:00.120
19 is the average age when Swedes move away from home.

41
00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:05.600
In Monaco.

42
00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:10.480
It is an over -representation on nobility and royalty.
 They don't move.

43
00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:15.480
They live in their males and castles.
 So it's Monaco.

44
00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:19.800
Hello, how hard!
 I think it's false.

45
00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:21.880
Why?

46
00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:26.760
Okay that you want to live in a castle, but it gets boring.

47
00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:30.960
-How do you know that?
 - You want their own life.

48
00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:34.160
A castle, not a second on the south.

49
00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:38.680
- Maybe, but ... - you still think that Thanos is lying?

50
00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:44.360
You do that right in. Congratulations, Carola.
 You've received a point.

51
00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:50.920
Royal or not.
 The country where people live at home is Portugal.

52
00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:56.600
- Niklas, who do you choose to talk to?
 -I...

53
00:03:56.760 --> 00:04:00.360
- I drive on Hassan.
 -I love you.

54
00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:03.960
Hassan?

55
00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:10.120
- Camel Pung Bullets.
 - Sant.

56
00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:13.200
- Well!
 - No, not camel pounding balls.

57
00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:16.720
There are camel meatballs.

58
00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:21.760
It's called a nice word in Arabic, Tiz Gamel.

59
00:04:21.920 --> 00:04:26.000
I don't know if you know what Tiz is, but it means butt.

60
00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:30.480
This is because the meat at the butt is very masquerade, like Waguy.

61
00:04:30.640 --> 00:04:34.640
So it's meatballs.
 Meatballs are.

62
00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:38.160
- Yeah.
 -True or false?

63
00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:43.320
–Fi Gamel, is it Egypt's ...?
 -No no!
 Tiz!

64
00:04:43.480 --> 00:04:47.560
/ Everyone says Tiz/ I believe in Hassan.

65
00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:53.400
You believe in Hassan?
 To camel meatballs ...

66
00:04:53.560 --> 00:04:59.320
... As for some reason, Göt Camel is called, is the true answer?

67
00:04:59.480 --> 00:05:05.120
You believe in Hassan.
 Good that you are ashamed, because it is clear that it is false.

68
00:05:08.360 --> 00:05:10.640
Unfortunately no points.

69
00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:14.480
Koshari, the national law of Egypt, is a carbohydrate intensive plate:

70
00:05:14.640 --> 00:05:20.080
Rice, macaroni, lentils, chickpeas, roasted onions and tomato sauce.

71
00:05:20.240 --> 00:05:24.400
Christian, should we see if you manage to get a point?

72
00:05:24.560 --> 00:05:26.720
--Assia.
 -Hello!

73
00:05:26.880 --> 00:05:29.120
Time for a video question.

74
00:05:29.280 --> 00:05:33.760
An aheebak ya habiibi nakupnda mimi sana ...

75
00:05:33.920 --> 00:05:37.720
The Somali woman went viral in 2021 with the song.

76
00:05:40.160 --> 00:05:42.920
First Off, Fuck Yo 'Bitch and the Clique You Claim

77
00:05:43.080 --> 00:05:45.320
Westside when we ride, come equipped with game

78
00:05:45.480 --> 00:05:47.960
You Claim to Be A Player, But I Fucked Your Wife

79
00:05:48.120 --> 00:05:51.320
We bust on bad boys, niggas fucked for life

80
00:05:52.720 --> 00:05:56.640
There was new singing at Skansen.
 I like it.

81
00:05:56.800 --> 00:06:00.880
Hit Em Up is really the Wonder World black skulls.

82
00:06:01.040 --> 00:06:06.800
She sings to all Somalis in exile to come back to her home country.

83
00:06:06.960 --> 00:06:12.480
This is where those bastards need to be.
 We Somalis are there!

84
00:06:13.560 --> 00:06:18.840
I have no idea.
 We say it's true.

85
00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:23.280
You trust Assia, that exile somalis should come home?

86
00:06:23.440 --> 00:06:27.480
It's false.
 Unfortunately, there were no points now either.

87
00:06:27.640 --> 00:06:30.920
She sings I love you in Somali, Arabic -

88
00:06:31.080 --> 00:06:33.680
- Swahili and English.

89
00:06:33.840 --> 00:06:35.840
How did it go?

90
00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:39.720
An aheebak ya habiibi nakupnda mimi sana

91
00:06:39.880 --> 00:06:42.760
Ogsoonow inan kujeclahay

92
00:06:43.680 --> 00:06:46.160
I love you, my baby

93
00:06:46.320 --> 00:06:51.560
- It's our national anthem.
 - Carola?
 Only you have received points.

94
00:06:51.720 --> 00:06:56.320
- Do you get another one?
 Who do you choose?
 - Loreen.

95
00:06:56.480 --> 00:07:01.720
Oh my God!
 What were you thinking?

96
00:07:04.560 --> 00:07:09.160
Turkmenistan's flag, darling.
 You see the symbol.

97
00:07:09.320 --> 00:07:14.160
It represents the release of the Turkmen-

98
00:07:14.320 --> 00:07:16.960
- From none other than Djingis Khan.

99
00:07:17.120 --> 00:07:23.160
Oh!
 I have to look at Loreen and see if I can see ...

100
00:07:23.320 --> 00:07:27.000
Look at me.
 Walla, I speak the truth, Habibi.

101
00:07:27.160 --> 00:07:31.040
- She is the Moroccan.
 Do not forget.
 - How does it feel, Carola?

102
00:07:31.200 --> 00:07:35.360
It feels like you should.
 I have to plug flags.

103
00:07:35.520 --> 00:07:40.720
- I say it's false.
 -Do you just like it's false?

104
00:07:40.880 --> 00:07:47.200
You do that right in. Congratulations, Carola!
 You've got one more point.

105
00:07:47.360 --> 00:07:52.600
It is definitely not Turkmenistan's flag, but the Republic of Jämtland.

106
00:07:52.760 --> 00:07:54.720
Jämtland?!

107
00:07:54.880 --> 00:07:58.680
An association has been pushing Jämtland's independence for a long time.

108
00:07:58.840 --> 00:08:01.160
A bit like Sweden's Kurds.

109
00:08:01.320 --> 00:08:06.000
It's half fun.
 Their current president is Eva Röse.

110
00:08:06.160 --> 00:08:10.880
- The clip was from Storsjöyran.
 - There I have played.

111
00:08:11.040 --> 00:08:16.480
Congratulations to the second score.
 - Niklas, who do you trust?

112
00:08:16.640 --> 00:08:20.920
- No butts, I promise.
 - I take Diego.

113
00:08:25.920 --> 00:08:32.400
In Colombia on New Year before the twelve, pack a suitcase, La Maleta.

114
00:08:32.560 --> 00:08:37.600
Then you walk around the neighborhood and think about where to travel.
 It should be lucky.

115
00:08:37.760 --> 00:08:40.400
It is our tradition.

116
00:08:42.960 --> 00:08:48.800
Why do you look like you want to return to the camel issue?
 What is the gut feeling?

117
00:08:48.960 --> 00:08:54.360
- It is such a fall height here.
 - Come again, come on, Niklas!

118
00:08:54.520 --> 00:08:57.760
- Yng!
 - Vamonos!
 Let's go.
 I believe in him.

119
00:08:57.920 --> 00:09:03.480
You think it's true?
 Congratulations!
 You've received a point.

120
00:09:05.320 --> 00:09:07.600
Bravo, Niklas!

121
00:09:07.760 --> 00:09:10.920
It can happen.
 La Maleta is a Colombian tradition.

122
00:09:11.080 --> 00:09:15.760
If you wish to travel next year, fill the bag with important stuff -

123
00:09:15.920 --> 00:09:21.240
–And goes around the neighborhood.
 - You are heavy, Niklas.
 Welcome into the match.

124
00:09:21.400 --> 00:09:25.720
- Christian, now we drive.
 - Then we drive Filip.

125
00:09:32.680 --> 00:09:36.520
He cut his nose on the Zlatan statue.

126
00:09:36.680 --> 00:09:41.200
No.
 He has raised one of Sweden's largest rappers -

127
00:09:41.360 --> 00:09:45.960
- which is called the prince of Rosengård, namely Timbuktu.

128
00:09:49.040 --> 00:09:54.040
I have to take points now.
 I don't have the faintest.

129
00:09:55.560 --> 00:09:59.320
- No, I don't believe it.
 -Not?

130
00:09:59.480 --> 00:10:04.000
Congratulations, Christian.
 You have also received a point.
 Najs.

131
00:10:04.160 --> 00:10:10.080
Dialy Mory Diabaté or "Dallas" has worked with young people in Rosengård for 40 years -

132
00:10:10.240 --> 00:10:14.160
–And has been noticed for its great commitment.

133
00:10:17.080 --> 00:10:19.480
- Can you bring home full pot?
 -Hope.

134
00:10:19.640 --> 00:10:23.880
- A panelist left to choose from.
 - Something whispers: Petrina.

135
00:10:24.040 --> 00:10:28.120
I'm not sure it's a good idea.

136
00:10:28.280 --> 00:10:31.520
I take ... wait, who do I have left?

137
00:10:31.680 --> 00:10:35.000
- It's one left.
 - I take her, then.

138
00:10:35.160 --> 00:10:40.680
I feel like the last kid at an orphanage.
 "No, not she."

139
00:10:40.840 --> 00:10:46.400
- Sorry!
 I'll take her.
 It will be fine.
 - Petrina?

140
00:10:49.280 --> 00:10:53.040
It is difficult to accommodate a stolen TV in the jeans.

141
00:10:55.120 --> 00:10:56.960
Nah.

142
00:10:57.920 --> 00:11:00.760
It is considered ugly to show the gender.

143
00:11:00.920 --> 00:11:05.760
In trousers you see the contours.
 You should not do that, hence a skirt.

144
00:11:07.400 --> 00:11:11.520
- I think that is false.
 - Secure?

145
00:11:11.680 --> 00:11:16.640
So, I ... it's absolutely false.
 It must be.

146
00:11:16.800 --> 00:11:22.040
Absolutely false?
 I love self-confidence.
 But that is unfortunately true.

147
00:11:22.200 --> 00:11:24.920
There will be no point, Carola.

148
00:11:25.080 --> 00:11:29.440
Roma women should not wear pants because it is too revealing.

149
00:11:29.600 --> 00:11:36.160
However, large velvet skirts are only carried by Finnish Roma.
 They weigh 8-10 kilos.

150
00:11:36.320 --> 00:11:39.600
Every Day is Leg Day.

151
00:11:39.760 --> 00:11:44.920
If we look at the scoreboard, we notice that Carola has gone to the final.

152
00:11:45.080 --> 00:11:48.240
You should bring some of the guys with you.

153
00:11:48.400 --> 00:11:52.000
Niklas, all panelists are consumed -

154
00:11:52.160 --> 00:11:57.360
- So your last panelist is randomly selected.

155
00:12:02.400 --> 00:12:07.560
That is you, Diego.
 No, Hassan!
 Sorry.

156
00:12:07.720 --> 00:12:09.560
I do not know...

157
00:12:09.720 --> 00:12:14.880
The only time as immigrants is about to be randomly selected.

158
00:12:15.040 --> 00:12:20.160
You would never see it at Arlanda.
 "Take me. Me! Here!"

159
00:12:21.240 --> 00:12:23.280
We will run a music issue.

160
00:12:23.440 --> 00:12:28.000
Bi-L Kurmanji, by êbne Allah Ikhalli Efendine

161
00:12:28.160 --> 00:12:32.680
Were Were Werre Ez Heyrana Bejna te me

162
00:12:37.520 --> 00:12:41.600
The song we heard is in Kurdish, Turkish and Arabic.

163
00:12:43.320 --> 00:12:49.440
That you should get beer.
 It has become a large party song in Sweden.

164
00:12:49.600 --> 00:12:55.120
You should pick up yogurt, water, onion.
 But you must not forget the beer.

165
00:12:55.280 --> 00:12:58.800
- Fan what Niklas got thirsty.
 -Yes.

166
00:12:58.960 --> 00:13:05.120
- Have you partyed for the song, Niklas?
 - I have heard it ten thousand times.

167
00:13:05.280 --> 00:13:10.440
I like it a lot, but have never understood the text.

168
00:13:10.600 --> 00:13:14.800
I don't think that's right.
 No.

169
00:13:14.960 --> 00:13:19.480
You don't think the song is about picking up beer.

170
00:13:19.640 --> 00:13:23.920
Unfortunately, Niklas.
 No point.
 Because that's actually true.

171
00:13:24.080 --> 00:13:28.600
-Is it true?!
 - It's about fetching water.

172
00:13:28.760 --> 00:13:35.240
And beer.
 The audience is allowed to jump in.
 I will explain.
 The song is Su Getir.

173
00:13:35.400 --> 00:13:40.280
Artist Bahoz sings that you should pick up beer, water, yogurt and onions.

174
00:13:40.440 --> 00:13:45.160
In Turkish, Kurmanji and Arabic.
 A party hit in Sweden and in Norway.

175
00:13:45.320 --> 00:13:51.480
- In chorus 28, the beer comes in.
 - We play it from start to finish.

176
00:13:51.640 --> 00:13:55.840
Unfortunately, Niklas, you got no points.
 - Christian, you have no question left.

177
00:13:56.000 --> 00:14:00.320
Now it becomes a rash issue between you.
 Closest to wins.

178
00:14:10.560 --> 00:14:13.280
-Were you born in Sweden?
 -Yes.

179
00:14:13.440 --> 00:14:16.160
It is not noticeable, I thought.

180
00:14:17.520 --> 00:14:22.960
Najs.
 You have written answers?
 Keep it up, so everyone sees what you have guessed.

181
00:14:23.120 --> 00:14:27.760
- Have you written as a percentage?
 - They would answer as a percentage.

182
00:14:30.080 --> 00:14:33.520
Niklas, you answered 20 percent.

183
00:14:33.680 --> 00:14:36.440
- Christian?
 –19.

184
00:14:36.600 --> 00:14:40.480
-Oh oh oh.
 - Jobbly.

185
00:14:40.640 --> 00:14:46.080
The right answer, my ladies and gentlemen: 20 percent!

186
00:14:48.080 --> 00:14:52.440
Congratulations, Niklas!
 You nailed it.
 - Christian, thank you.

187
00:14:52.600 --> 00:14:58.000
The correct answer is 20 percent.
 We have our finalists: Carola and Niklas!

188
00:15:05.080 --> 00:15:11.080
Carola, you can start the final round.
 But I explain what will happen.

189
00:15:11.240 --> 00:15:16.440
First to five.
 But when you answer the wrong, the point goes to the opponent.

190
00:15:16.600 --> 00:15:22.760
- Carola, who do you choose to start with?
 - I like Thanos.
 I'll take him again.

191
00:15:24.720 --> 00:15:30.840
- You are alone in liking Thanos.
 - I have wife and children, you a slipper.

192
00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:34.520
-Do you want it?
 -No.

193
00:15:35.360 --> 00:15:37.920
Check.

194
00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:43.520
She will leave it tomorrow.
 Do not remove it.

195
00:15:43.680 --> 00:15:45.720
-Thanks so much.
 -Thanos!

196
00:15:49.080 --> 00:15:51.160
Kista Galleria.

197
00:15:53.120 --> 00:15:55.880
Country.

198
00:15:56.760 --> 00:16:00.320
- You take, right?
 - Yes, Walla.
 I get it.

199
00:16:00.480 --> 00:16:04.080
The whole Lore is laughing: "I've been to Kista Galleria."

200
00:16:04.240 --> 00:16:08.920
- "It's fun because it's true!"
 - Sink, the name ...

201
00:16:09.080 --> 00:16:12.080
- I die, that is.
 - Per capita in the world.

202
00:16:12.240 --> 00:16:15.200
Iran.

203
00:16:15.360 --> 00:16:21.920
Many exiliaranies go back there to perform plastic surgery.

204
00:16:22.080 --> 00:16:23.880
So ... yeah.

205
00:16:24.040 --> 00:16:27.960
I say from my heart that it is / piper / false.

206
00:16:28.120 --> 00:16:32.040
Why does your heart say it's / Piper / False?

207
00:16:32.200 --> 00:16:35.080
Because...

208
00:16:35.240 --> 00:16:40.560
I just don't think you focus on plastic in Iran.

209
00:16:40.720 --> 00:16:43.600
-I do not know why.
 I could be wrong.
 --Wow!

210
00:16:43.760 --> 00:16:50.200
Maybe in Sweden, if you are from Iran.
 But not in Iran.
 False.

211
00:16:50.360 --> 00:16:56.280
You choose not to believe in Thanos.
 Congratulations, you've got a point.

212
00:16:57.320 --> 00:17:02.000
It's false.
 Most plastic operations are done in South Korea.

213
00:17:02.160 --> 00:17:05.400
Huh?
 Not Turkey?!

214
00:17:06.480 --> 00:17:10.080
You could believe Turkey, but South Koreans are more driven.

215
00:17:10.240 --> 00:17:14.760
According to surveys, every third South Korean woman in her 20s has

216
00:17:14.920 --> 00:17:17.840
- Made some form of plastic surgery.

217
00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:23.680
Congratulations, Carola.
 - Niklas, starting from the bottom.
 Now you're here.

218
00:17:23.840 --> 00:17:26.320
This is the peak.

219
00:17:26.480 --> 00:17:28.960
- I drive Assia.
 --Assia?

220
00:17:31.640 --> 00:17:34.800
That Kanye has become cancelled.

221
00:17:34.960 --> 00:17:40.120
No.
 When you celebrate Sabbath it is a boy's circumcision.

222
00:17:40.280 --> 00:17:44.520
The foreskin you take and bury at a discount ...

223
00:17:44.680 --> 00:17:50.080
Or it may end up in a flower pot, but, yes ... in soil near the home.

224
00:17:50.240 --> 00:17:54.280
After the funeral you have a ceremony.

225
00:17:54.440 --> 00:17:57.400
Oy Vey, Niklas!

226
00:17:57.560 --> 00:18:02.440
- I know that "it's a thing".
 - What of it?

227
00:18:02.600 --> 00:18:07.560
- Planting foreskin?
 -It's where I start ...

228
00:18:07.720 --> 00:18:11.280
--... Don't keep up.
 - Stackarn.

229
00:18:11.440 --> 00:18:16.520
Pung balls, tiz and now foreskin.

230
00:18:16.680 --> 00:18:20.240
Do you have yours left?

231
00:18:21.200 --> 00:18:26.880
Niklas is probably the only one in the room that has left his.
 - Niklas?

232
00:18:27.040 --> 00:18:29.400
Yeah.
 Eh ...

233
00:18:29.560 --> 00:18:32.880
- I think that's right.
 - You think that's true?

234
00:18:33.040 --> 00:18:38.720
Sabbath is a party to celebrate the circumcision?
 The point goes to Carola.

235
00:18:41.800 --> 00:18:45.000
Sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry.

236
00:18:45.160 --> 00:18:47.640
The Sabbath is the holy rest day of the Jews.

237
00:18:47.800 --> 00:18:52.000
Which is celebrated from Friday night, with Sabbath meal, until Saturday night.

238
00:18:52.160 --> 00:18:55.920
Carola, before I go on my Sabbath, choose someone.

239
00:18:56.080 --> 00:18:59.600
- I want to try Diego.
 - Hey!

240
00:18:59.760 --> 00:19:04.840
On a Chilean celebration, someone can pick up a handkerchief and suggest ...

241
00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:11.600
It's a ritual in Chile where you fit around a handkerchief -

242
00:19:11.760 --> 00:19:15.000
- As I do now, and sneeze ...

243
00:19:15.160 --> 00:19:20.320
–Don't give me that shit.
 - We are equally worthy, you understand.

244
00:19:20.480 --> 00:19:23.800
Can't you just say that?

245
00:19:23.960 --> 00:19:28.520
- Those down there too, we are equally worthy.
 -I do not think so.

246
00:19:28.680 --> 00:19:31.880
I think we are different.

247
00:19:36.200 --> 00:19:42.360
Is Cueca a tradition where you share a handkerchief to show equality?

248
00:19:42.520 --> 00:19:46.480
- Otherwise, it's too disgusting.
 - I am not Chilean.

249
00:19:46.640 --> 00:19:52.760
It sounds nice to share something, but not Sneese.
 So I say ...

250
00:19:52.920 --> 00:19:55.440
Oh!
 False.

251
00:19:55.600 --> 00:19:59.680
You say it is false because it sounds really good.

252
00:19:59.840 --> 00:20:03.280
-Congratulations.
 You got one more point.
 -Yes!

253
00:20:04.600 --> 00:20:09.800
It's false.
 If someone offers you a cueca they want to make a pair dance.

254
00:20:09.960 --> 00:20:14.720
Cueca is Chile's national dance where you wave a handkerchief.

255
00:20:14.880 --> 00:20:18.280
- Niklas?
 - Loreen.

256
00:20:18.440 --> 00:20:23.920
Researchers investigated how Swedish students experience Finnish Swedish.

257
00:20:29.160 --> 00:20:32.680
The content of the promil, Walla.

258
00:20:32.840 --> 00:20:38.760
I'm just kidding.
 There are Finnish Swedes and pure pimples.

259
00:20:38.920 --> 00:20:42.320
And Finnish -Swedish, the mining -

260
00:20:42.480 --> 00:20:47.800
- Let a little more intelligent, a little finer.

261
00:20:47.960 --> 00:20:52.600
While the mining of Finns that have Swedish as a second language -

262
00:20:52.760 --> 00:20:57.680
- Not as intelligent, boring and even ugly.

263
00:20:57.840 --> 00:21:00.960
Yes ... eh.

264
00:21:01.120 --> 00:21:07.200
I continue on the wrapped, rather bad path that I have chosen -

265
00:21:07.360 --> 00:21:12.200
- To say true.
 But I think that's true.

266
00:21:12.360 --> 00:21:16.400
Congratulations, Niklas.
 You've received a point.

267
00:21:18.520 --> 00:21:24.520
According to a small study, Stockholmers valued Finnish Swede Higher -

268
00:21:24.680 --> 00:21:30.720
- While the Falubs thought the opposite.
 Like we care about Falubor!

269
00:21:30.880 --> 00:21:34.800
- Carola?
 - Haa ... Hassan.

270
00:21:36.240 --> 00:21:38.560
Here we go.

271
00:21:41.040 --> 00:21:44.080
It means "don't sell fishes".

272
00:21:44.240 --> 00:21:49.200
- "Don't Sell Fisar"?
 - You just got ass Content today.

273
00:21:49.360 --> 00:21:53.760
-Yes.
 This is also sexual!
 - He is not through Freud's anal phase.

274
00:21:53.920 --> 00:21:58.800
I can explain.
 It's like an Albanian Jantelag.

275
00:21:58.960 --> 00:22:04.640
In Sweden we say: "Keep on the carpet, brother. Don't sell."

276
00:22:04.800 --> 00:22:09.040
- Can you sell fishes?
 "Don't sell fades," I said!

277
00:22:09.200 --> 00:22:14.040
- What then "don't sell"?
 - I do it on my only fan.

278
00:22:16.480 --> 00:22:21.840
There you have it.
 Mos Shit Porde!
 So.

279
00:22:22.000 --> 00:22:25.520
I may regret it, but think it's false.

280
00:22:25.680 --> 00:22:29.160
Thanks.
 The point goes over to Niklas.

281
00:22:33.080 --> 00:22:37.960
When you say "Mos Shit Porde", it's "Keep your bullshit".

282
00:22:38.120 --> 00:22:42.760
Stay on the carpet, Carola.
 The point is Niklas.
 Mos Shit Porde!

283
00:22:42.920 --> 00:22:48.840
- Niklas, you have received two points.
 - How fuck did it go?

284
00:22:49.000 --> 00:22:52.680
Let's go.
 I drive elaf.

285
00:23:01.720 --> 00:23:09.280
Well, in Hinduism it is important to embrace both darkness and light.

286
00:23:09.440 --> 00:23:13.240
And Diwali, which occurs in the autumn -

287
00:23:13.400 --> 00:23:18.400
- Shows about celebrating that the darkness has come, simply.

288
00:23:18.560 --> 00:23:22.080
It sounds strange to celebrate the darkness.

289
00:23:23.160 --> 00:23:28.040
–Darkness, Baby, Darkness.
 -You Need to Celebrate It, Walla.

290
00:23:28.200 --> 00:23:33.160
I don't want to celebrate the darkness, so I say it's not true.

291
00:23:33.320 --> 00:23:39.280
That's why you say it's false.
 It gives you a point.
 Congratulations!

292
00:23:40.880 --> 00:23:45.800
They celebrate the light.
 Diwali is the celebration of light and lasts for five days.

293
00:23:45.960 --> 00:23:50.680
They teeth fireworks, houses are decorated with lamps and you give presents.

294
00:23:50.840 --> 00:23:54.760
It says 3–3.
 - Are you going to take over the lead?

295
00:23:54.920 --> 00:23:58.360
I choose Filip, of course.

296
00:23:58.520 --> 00:24:02.080
Römosseskolan was closed by the School Inspectorate in 2022.

297
00:24:04.200 --> 00:24:09.800
He had embezzled SEK 12 million of the school money.

298
00:24:09.960 --> 00:24:16.400
It seems that he has among other things put it on sex purchases -

299
00:24:16.560 --> 00:24:23.480
- "Adult hotel" in Thailand and an Islamist party in Somalia.

300
00:24:23.640 --> 00:24:27.240
Possibly her relatives there.

301
00:24:32.800 --> 00:24:37.080
It can certainly be true.
 The world is dark, but ...

302
00:24:37.240 --> 00:24:40.480
Not according to Niklas, apparently.

303
00:24:43.840 --> 00:24:46.720
It's ... fake.

304
00:24:46.880 --> 00:24:53.280
You think Filip lied to you?
 The point just went over to Niklas.

305
00:24:54.960 --> 00:25:00.720
The principal and moderate Waberi were convicted of embezzlement and accounting violations.

306
00:25:00.880 --> 00:25:06.280
According to Media's review, the money should have been used for ...

307
00:25:06.440 --> 00:25:09.160
... stuff in Thailand.

308
00:25:09.320 --> 00:25:13.320
Niklas, who we now see on the scoreboard it says 4–3.

309
00:25:13.480 --> 00:25:17.880
If you answer the next question correctly, you have won the whole thing.

310
00:25:18.040 --> 00:25:22.320
- Dinner.
 - You have a panelist to choose from.

311
00:25:22.480 --> 00:25:26.880
- Why are you always last?
 - In don't know.

312
00:25:27.040 --> 00:25:29.480
- Petrina?
 -Yes.

313
00:25:33.400 --> 00:25:35.800
Burn it.

314
00:25:35.960 --> 00:25:39.360
It's true.
 There are different ways.

315
00:25:39.520 --> 00:25:45.240
When a Qur'an is old and worn one should either bury it -

316
00:25:45.400 --> 00:25:50.640
- Sink it in running water or, last resort, burn it.

317
00:25:50.800 --> 00:25:54.120
It became a fucking misunderstanding with Paludan.

318
00:25:54.280 --> 00:25:59.120
People thought he was a racist, but he had just read it.

319
00:26:02.120 --> 00:26:08.800
Now I want to see what the gut feeling says.
 I'm glad that is the last question.

320
00:26:11.080 --> 00:26:13.800
I thought it sounded nice from the beginning.

321
00:26:13.960 --> 00:26:19.120
It starts to get worn and you have to find a burial ground.

322
00:26:19.280 --> 00:26:23.680
Then you should drown it and then burn it.

323
00:26:23.840 --> 00:26:30.480
It traced out a bit there.
 I don't think you can burn a Qur'an.

324
00:26:30.640 --> 00:26:33.400
You say it's false?

325
00:26:33.560 --> 00:26:37.760
Congratulations, Carola, you've got one more point.

326
00:26:37.920 --> 00:26:40.120
Wait.
 Huh?

327
00:26:40.280 --> 00:26:42.920
I like your way of thinking, but that's true.

328
00:26:43.080 --> 00:26:47.880
But do not burn it with garbage or together a racist Danish.

329
00:26:48.040 --> 00:26:52.400
- Out in a clean place, become ashes ... - know trail.

330
00:26:52.560 --> 00:26:59.520
We see that it is 4–4, which means it will be a matter of rash.

331
00:27:09.360 --> 00:27:12.760
- We should write the year then?
 -Exactly.

332
00:27:12.920 --> 00:27:16.800
- tiz Gamel.
 - Come again now, Niklas.

333
00:27:18.720 --> 00:27:22.200
Carola and Niklas, show us your answers, are you please.

334
00:27:22.360 --> 00:27:25.480
-Oh!
 - damn!

335
00:27:25.640 --> 00:27:29.280
-What did you write?
 - Niklas says 1975.

336
00:27:29.440 --> 00:27:32.680
Carola, you say 1976.

337
00:27:34.840 --> 00:27:40.640
The correct answer to when the first Indian restaurant was opened in Sweden is:

338
00:27:40.800 --> 00:27:45.440
1971 in Gothenburg!
 - Niklas, congratulations!

339
00:27:47.200 --> 00:27:49.200
You have won the entire program.

340
00:27:49.360 --> 00:27:53.000
Carola, thank you for being competing.

341
00:27:54.880 --> 00:27:56.920
Arrived.

342
00:27:58.000 --> 00:28:02.320
You have got Jämtland's fine flag.
 Place it around you.

343
00:28:04.880 --> 00:28:08.480
–Yes.
 Here you have your IFS diploma.
 -Thanks!

344
00:28:08.640 --> 00:28:13.240
Immediately after this, we will cut your foreskin.
 Congratulations, Niklas.

345
00:28:13.400 --> 00:28:16.160
Thanks for this week.

346
00:28:17.360 --> 00:28:19.720
What happened?
 What happened?

347
00:28:19.880 --> 00:28:22.960

348
00:28:27.320 --> 00:28:29.480
