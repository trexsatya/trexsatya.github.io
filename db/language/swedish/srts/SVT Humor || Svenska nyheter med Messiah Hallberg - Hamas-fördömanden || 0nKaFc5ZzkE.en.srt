00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:07,200
Saturday's brutal terrorist attack from Hamas against Israeli civil targets

2
00:00:07,360 --> 00:00:10,160
have aroused upset all over the world.

3
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:12,320
But this is a sensitive issue.

4
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:18,240
So sensitive that Swedish otherwise so stable news readers will panic.

5
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:20,560
This is Israel, the bright field.

6
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:23,840
There are also two areas here

7
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,880
Where Palestinians have more or less influence and rule.

8
00:00:28,040 --> 00:00:31,000
I'm not going to go into it in detail - it's sensitive.

9
00:00:31,160 --> 00:00:36,200
Thanks, Anders Kraft.
 - There wasn't much power in that, just Anders.

10
00:00:36,360 --> 00:00:40,680
I'm not going to review journalists.
 Going into detail is sensitive.

11
00:00:40,840 --> 00:00:43,840
But I understand you, Anders.
 Treads wrong on this question

12
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,960
is it easy to be accused of being Islamophobic or anti -Semit

13
00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:51,480
Or if you are really customer: both.
 It is very sensitive

14
00:00:51,640 --> 00:00:57,600
And that's why we look at how this terror has been condemned in Sweden.

15
00:00:57,760 --> 00:01:00,040
We start at the far right.

16
00:01:00,200 --> 00:01:04,680
The civilized world stands behind Israel's right to defend itself.

17
00:01:04,840 --> 00:01:08,840
We must be crystal clear that we are behind Israel at this moment.

18
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,760
We should freeze aid to Palestine immediately.

19
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:14,880
The Swedish right has longer had a pro-Israeli attitude.

20
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:22,880
SD has wanted a little back and forth in the Jewish issue.

21
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:27,240
But the Sosses have been more pro-Palestine since Palme

22
00:01:27,400 --> 00:01:29,360
But now it has sounded like this:

23
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:33,240
It is important that the world speaks with a voice

24
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:36,880
both in condemning Hamas attack

25
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:41,680
And be clear that Israel has a legal right to defend itself.

26
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:43,800
When such a terrible thing happens

27
00:01:43,960 --> 00:01:48,720
The Sosses must temporarily put away the Palestinian shawl.

28
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:53,680
Or shawl ... it's probably more a kind of scarf.
 No scarf anyway.

29
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:57,440
The sisters in all glory - those who have really made it their thing

30
00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:00,680
We find to support Palestine at the far left.

31
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:04,520
What did Nooshi Dadgostar say about this terrorist act?

32
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:06,800
We see an escalation.

33
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:12,480
In order not to be a carnage, a ceasefire is required.

34
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:16,880
Now the violence and attacks must cease.

35
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:18,840
Of course, this also applies to Israel.

36
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,760
Look there, it was well pragmatic.

37
00:02:20,920 --> 00:02:24,960
Sure, she mentioned dutifully Israel's responsibility, but balanced.

38
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:29,040
A classic example of two thoughts in the head at the same time.

39
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:33,200
But you know what left -wing parties think about two things at the same time?

40
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:38,080
They are not fond.
 One thought, otherwise it will be super -messy up here.

41
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:42,400
On Twitter, Nooshi was even clearer: "Terrible attack by Hamas."

42
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:46,320
"I condemn all crimes against civil and international law."

43
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:50,080
Sorry, nooshi.
 Which party do you think you lead?

44
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:54,280
A reasonable party that reacts with reason?
 No!

45
00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:57,520
You lead the Left Party.
 What do you think will happen?

46
00:02:57,680 --> 00:03:01,320
The internal criticism came as a letter on the post, though on Facebook.

47
00:03:01,480 --> 00:03:07,400
Ekot has taken part in posts in a Facebook group for members of V

48
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:09,720
where a number of people are critical to

49
00:03:09,880 --> 00:03:14,160
that Nooshi Dadgostar chooses to condemn Hamas attacks against Israel

50
00:03:14,320 --> 00:03:19,400
Without at the same time making a statement in support of the Palestinian people.

51
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:23,000
Many people in V felt compelled to mark here.

52
00:03:23,160 --> 00:03:25,200
Not against Hamas, but against Nooshi.

53
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:29,200
Party mates rage and call this everything from populism

54
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:31,400
to bad double standards.

55
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:38,120
Municipal politician Björn Alling thinks Nooshi "licking Sionistörö".

56
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:41,560
Sioniströv is apparently not Kosher for Björn Alling.

57
00:03:41,720 --> 00:03:44,480
He came up with two simple wishes:

58
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:49,000
Nooshi's departure and abolition of the state of Israel.

59
00:03:49,160 --> 00:03:52,640
Departure seems to be, but not for that bear had intended.

60
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:56,920
In the afternoon the message came that the Left Party's party board

61
00:03:57,080 --> 00:04:00,680
started an exclusion process against Björn Alling.

62
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:04,880
Sad for Björn, but he has great support within the party.

63
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:08,280
It has been started a name gathering against his exclusion

64
00:04:08,440 --> 00:04:11,440
which over a hundred party mates have written on.

65
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:15,880
Remember that these are people who had been standing in Manhattan 9/11

66
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:20,640
Seen the plan hit the towers and demanded that Nooshi resign.

67
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:25,320
Not from the mediocre Arab pilots, but the US war crime.

68
00:04:25,480 --> 00:04:31,040
Today, on eleventh September?
 Can't you wait until September twelve?

69
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:33,000
But the question remains:

70
00:04:33,160 --> 00:04:37,840
What would Hamas have to do to make nooshi mildly condemn terror

71
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,320
Without getting internal criticism?

72
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:44,480
To answer that, I have taken the help of this old can.

73
00:04:44,640 --> 00:04:50,600
It is a left critic calculator it works canon.

74
00:04:50,760 --> 00:04:53,280
I am entering data over Hama's terrorist act

75
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:57,600
And so it calculates if Nooshi can condemn it without internal criticism.

76
00:04:57,760 --> 00:05:00,720
It's a bit complicated, but this is an old faithful.

77
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:06,400
It has been with Lars Werner's time.
 It still smells of wine.

78
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:13,280
You don't have to applaud your computer.
 It has no feelings.
 Applaud me.

79
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:16,040
We start with this weekend's deed:

80
00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:19,520
"The worst day of Jewish slaughter since World War II."

81
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:22,200
And then I press the "Nooshi condemns" button.

82
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:26,480
Then it is internal criticism.
 It wasn't terror enough.
 Then it still works.

83
00:05:26,640 --> 00:05:30,640
We try something stronger.
 I find some evil Hamas can do.

84
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:35,200
We feed in: "Hamas carries out the Holocaust 2.0."

85
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:38,120
And then I press the "Nooshi condemns" button.

86
00:05:38,280 --> 00:05:42,080
There was criticism again.
 Unbelievable.
 It must be even more serious.

87
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:44,720
Now we release all the barriers.

88
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:50,880
I have to come up with something really damn sick that Hamas can do.
 Oh, fuck.

89
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:55,960
"Hamas for free rental in new production."

90
00:05:56,120 --> 00:05:59,160
And then we press the button.
 No criticism!

91
00:05:59,320 --> 00:06:03,400
The whole party supports it!

92
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:05,960
Unbelievable.
 Unbelievable.

93
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:09,320
In addition, the calculator says that Björn Alling pronounces:

94
00:06:09,480 --> 00:06:11,720
“Bad double standards and populism of hamas”

95
00:06:11,880 --> 00:06:16,040
"Licking marketing. Freeze the assistance in Palestine - now."

96
00:06:22,280 --> 00:06:24,640
An incredible machine.
 Those are no longer done.
