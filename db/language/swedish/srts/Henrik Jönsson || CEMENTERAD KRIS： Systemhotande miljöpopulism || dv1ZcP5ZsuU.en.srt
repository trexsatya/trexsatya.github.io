1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.380
Environmental policy risks stopping Swedish cement production.
 Expresses this a progressive climate responsibility,

2
00:00:08.380 --> 00:00:13.980
or is it an idealistic decision with system -threatening consequences

3
00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:17.180
The Hardest Choices Require The Strongest Wills

4
00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:22.480
Sentences go apart, like a misunderstood block concrete

5
00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:33.120
My name is Henrik Jönsson, and I am an independent, libertarian entrepreneur and social debater.

6
00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:41.720
Recently, cement manufacturer Cementa's application for continued lime mining permit was rejected in Slite on Gotland.

7
00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:46.760
As a consequence, Sweden risks standing without cement at the end of October,

8
00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:47.980
We are all out

9
00:00:47.980 --> 00:00:55.680
With major consequences for both the construction industry, mining and for Swedish industrial exports.

10
00:00:55.680 --> 00:01:01.880
According to the construction industry's calculations, up to 400,000 jobs are threatened,

11
00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:11.680
And Sweden risks suffering an investment loss of SEK 20 billion a month as long as cement deficiency prevails.

12
00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:16.980
Why is this type of acute crisis situation constantly arises in modern Sweden

13
00:01:16.980 --> 00:01:23.380
Is it reasonable to regard this conflict as a choice between environment or cement

14
00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:36.480
And what happens to a society such as institutionalized emotional and ideological reactions to a greater extent than rational and long -term decision -making processes

15
00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:38.060
Feelings are action

16
00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:41.260
I address these questions in this week's video.

17
00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:48.960

Every Saturday morning at 0800 Swedish time

24
00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:38.560
Today I talk about cement, central control and cerebral processes.

25
00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:39.740
come along

26
00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:55.380
A cow we will drive in bet on our meadow ”and bolster of down we will have in our bed

27
00:02:55.380 --> 00:03:01.580
And nice postelin and glazed barrels ”you admit!
 Mayo you!
 So we should not have!

28
00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:07.480
But, you, you, you, where should we not take it.
 I'm too poor and you're too lazy

29
00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:15.180
You go on the root, and I go on state you admit!
 Mayo you!
 Where should we take no?

30
00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:24.760
So is the last two verses in Gustaf Fröding's economic satiric "marriage issue" from 1891.

31
00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:34.240
The discrepancy between the wishes of the in love and their economic reality illustrates in humor mirror the human nature's

32
00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:44.640
Duala nature, where the rapid, emotional feeling anticipates the slower rational thought process's skull reality.

33
00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:48.820
Honey, don't think I don't know how you feel.

34
00:03:48.820 --> 00:03:57.120
The award -winning Israeli psychologist and economist Daniel Kahneman describes in his book "Think quickly and slowly"

35
00:03:57.120 --> 00:04:05.120
These two parallel human attitudes.
 The first reaction system is fast, intuitive and emotionally

36
00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:10.120
Which in Fröding's poem is expressed with the exclamation "so we should not"

37
00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:19.920
The second system is slow, logical and requires mental effort to reach its answers, which is emphasized in the poem's questioning final clamp

38
00:04:19.920 --> 00:04:22.020
"Where are we going to take out"

39
00:04:22.020 --> 00:04:32.120
Properly applied, both of these systems are useful and helpful, but the slow system works poorly in acute crisis situations

40
00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:40.420
And the fast system risks making disastrous decisions regarding long -term and complex issues.

41
00:04:40.420 --> 00:04:43.380
Do Not Press the Core Destruct Button

42
00:04:43.380 --> 00:04:50.120
The environmental issue and its packaging in the debate often express a conflict between these two ways of thinking,

43
00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:57.520
Where the rapid reactions stand for climate anxiety, airbags and emotionally embossed symbolic measures,

44
00:04:57.520 --> 00:05:07.320
In a situation that really requires a pragmatic and well -founded reality anchoring so as not to risk becoming destructive and counterproductive.

45
00:05:07.320 --> 00:05:15.020
It is therefore important to avoid emotional reactions to problems that require rational solutions.

46
00:05:15.020 --> 00:05:18.040
Your highly emotional reaction is most illogical.

47
00:05:18.040 --> 00:05:27.240
In particular, it is important to avoid the temptation to play on voters 'rapid emotional reactions on complex issues as politicians to play the temptation of voters' rapid emotional reactions

48
00:05:27.240 --> 00:05:31.940
Which is a political approach that is sometimes called "populism".

49
00:05:31.940 --> 00:05:36.880
Libations for everybody

50
00:05:36.880 --> 00:05:43.720
A concrete example of how wrong thought systems on idealistic, and probably even emotional basis

51
00:05:43.720 --> 00:05:55.420
has permeated the Swedish administration is land and the Environmental Court's sudden rejection of the cement producer Cementa's right to break lime in Slite on Gotland.

52
00:05:55.420 --> 00:06:04.920
Cementa produces 85% of Sweden's cement, and had already applied four years ago for the extension of its lime mining rights,

53
00:06:04.920 --> 00:06:10.220
An request that was initially also approved by the Land and the Environmental Court.

54
00:06:10.220 --> 00:06:15.820
After the judgment was appealed by, among other things, the state authority the Swedish Environmental Protection Agency,

55
00:06:15.820 --> 00:06:26.520
The County Administrative Board of Gotland and a climate activist group called the Urberg group, so Cementa's application was rejected last week

56
00:06:26.520 --> 00:06:34.520
With the result that their cement production will be forced to cease by October last year.

57
00:06:34.520 --> 00:06:42.520
The reason why the application was rejected is that the court found the investigation into the consequences of the lime mining for the groundwater unsatisfactory.

58
00:06:42.520 --> 00:06:46.620
That the court chooses to reject Cementa's request so close to renewal date,

59
00:06:46.620 --> 00:06:52.520
Although the application was made four years ago, it makes it impossible for the company to supplement its application

60
00:06:52.520 --> 00:06:58.480
And they have now appealed to the Supreme Court with the hope that the case will be handled with priority.

61
00:07:00.700 --> 00:07:08.580
Responsibility for the crisis arising falls on the Löfven government and then Minister of the Environment Åsa Romson,

62
00:07:08.580 --> 00:07:16.280
As in 2018, the decision to expand the nature conservation areas around Cementa's limestone quarry in Slite.

63
00:07:16.280 --> 00:07:25.180
The Environmental Court's failure to Cementa's permit application specifically refers to the area hejnum Kallgate

64
00:07:25.180 --> 00:07:28.980
an area that the government extended.

65
00:07:28.980 --> 00:07:36.520
Cementa warned in 2017 in a statement that these changes meant that cement production

66
00:07:36.520 --> 00:07:43.920
"is considerably difficult/risked to cease, in the near future and in the long run."

67
00:07:43.920 --> 00:07:50.720
Cementa has produced cement for 100 years without operational disruptions.

68
00:07:50.720 --> 00:08:04.120
The current cement crisis is thus a direct consequence of an active government decision by the Löfven government, headed for by the Environment Party.

69
00:08:04.120 --> 00:08:10.320
But the consequences of a seemingly kind -hearted and ideologically embossed climate decision

70
00:08:10.320 --> 00:08:17.120
Can now prove to destabilize large parts of Sweden's infrastructure.

71
00:08:23.640 --> 00:08:33.420
The domino effect is the cumulative effect created when an event triggers a chain reaction of similar events.

72
00:08:33.420 --> 00:08:45.920
These types of chain reactions are at risk of becoming very large -scale and can be triggered through careless manipulation of seemingly insignificant details in a complex system.

73
00:08:46.240 --> 00:08:51.060
Within the climate activist movement, the understanding of this is relatively good,

74
00:08:51.060 --> 00:08:57.120
And you are therefore very keen to protect the ecosystem from different types of disorders.

75
00:08:57.120 --> 00:09:03.180
Fewer, however, extend the same understanding to the complex system of human civilization,

76
00:09:03.180 --> 00:09:09.080
whose productive work is expressed in the form of a global and self -regulating trading system

77
00:09:09.080 --> 00:09:15.880
Which is so complex that no human being has the capacity to overlook its whole.

78
00:09:15.880 --> 00:09:24.480
An entertaining illustration of this production system's breathtaking complexity was made in 2015 by an ambitious young Youtuber,

79
00:09:24.480 --> 00:09:28.860
Who set to make your own chicken sandwich.

80
00:09:28.860 --> 00:09:33.560
So, to really make their own chicken sandwich from scratch

81
00:09:33.560 --> 00:09:41.860
From growing own wheat and your own vegetables to breeding a chicken and extracting their own salt from the sea.

82
00:09:41.860 --> 00:09:48.360
Making a chicken sandwich that you can buy at the Press Office for under the hundredths

83
00:09:48.360 --> 00:09:55.460
Took him over half a year to do, and cost the equivalent of close to SEK 15,000.

84
00:09:55.460 --> 00:10:02.680
It is only through myriads of trade relations, specialist competencies and service exchanges

85
00:10:02.680 --> 00:10:10.380
As the fruits of modern civilization are available and it is very easy to take them for granted.

86
00:10:10.380 --> 00:10:19.120
Therefore, if one wants to limit the extraction of certain types of raw materials on a political basis, it is very important that you first implement

87
00:10:19.120 --> 00:10:29.820
in -depth impact assessments, as it very easily arises unforeseen imbalances in the trading system when the availability of different types of raw materials changes.

88
00:10:29.820 --> 00:10:33.140
Which, such as the availability of lime.

89
00:10:33.140 --> 00:10:41.240
It may with the way of the emotional, intuitive system of thinking appear both reasonable and sensible to slow down the interventions in nature,

90
00:10:41.240 --> 00:10:49.240
At the same time as the long -term, and slower thinking reveal secondary consequences that not only create

91
00:10:49.240 --> 00:10:56.340
Comprehensive societal problems, without who also risk being significantly worse for the environment.

92
00:10:56.340 --> 00:11:06.440
If you limit the availability of lime, it is not only a presumed greedy commodity company that becomes the battle on the fingers in favor of the environment

93
00:11:06.440 --> 00:11:16.540
Because by abruptly strangling the lime mining, a chain reaction is triggered throughout the Swedish trading system.

94
00:11:16.540 --> 00:11:23.040
Lime is needed to produce cement.
 If there is no cement, you cannot build any houses.

95
00:11:23.040 --> 00:11:28.340
Nor can one build any roads or renovate Sweden's rail systems

96
00:11:28.340 --> 00:11:35.140
And infrastructure projects such as the West Link and Stockholm's new lock will not be completed.

97
00:11:35.140 --> 00:11:42.820
In the next stage, Swedish mining also stops, as this is dependent on cement to strengthen the rock after blasting.

98
00:11:42.820 --> 00:11:55.020
The state mining group LKAB's forecasts indicates a loss of production of around 80% of all iron ore if you are deprived of access to cement.

99
00:11:55.020 --> 00:12:02.720
Without iron ore, in turn, the manufacturing industry stops, and Swedish exports collapse.

100
00:12:02.720 --> 00:12:09.600
The construction industry, which has already requested a crisis meeting with the government now warns that a construction stop of this type

101
00:12:09.600 --> 00:12:20.780
threatens between 200,000 and 400,000 jobs, while 3 out of 4 building projects will not be able to take place.

102
00:12:20.780 --> 00:12:29.640
According to the construction companies, this will in turn lead to an investment loss of approximately SEK 20 billion per month

103
00:12:29.640 --> 00:12:39.400
And then you do not include the investment loss that will affect an industry that stands without the iron, steel, the plate welfare.

104
00:12:39.400 --> 00:12:44.700
From the mine came the iron, steel, plate and welfare.

105
00:12:44.700 --> 00:12:48.260
In the next stage, logistics and the transport industry are affected.

106
00:12:48.260 --> 00:12:57.760
Without guaranteed deliveries of cement, iron ore and industrial products after October 31st, the drivers must be notified already in August.

107
00:12:57.760 --> 00:13:07.260
A lost logistics industry means longer delivery times on all types of goods, which in turn increases the pressure on fairways and public transport

108
00:13:07.260 --> 00:13:13.000
which cannot be renovated and maintained without cement, concrete and iron ore.

109
00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:17.100
The consequences quickly become irresponsible.

110
00:13:17.100 --> 00:13:26.300
For everything is connected: Whether it is something as simple as a sandwich or a bridge foundation in reinforced concrete,

111
00:13:26.300 --> 00:13:33.400
So all existing products are dependent on sensitive supply chains.

112
00:13:39.700 --> 00:13:46.960
The possibility of compensating for the ideologically established cement deficiency through procurement in the international market

113
00:13:46.960 --> 00:13:52.240
is limited due to delivery times and high international demand for cement.

114
00:13:52.240 --> 00:13:59.940
And even if Swedish companies would succeed in buying parties of overseas cement, this would be both considerably expensive

115
00:13:59.940 --> 00:14:10.040
And worse for the environment due to the low environmental requirements of the production countries, and because of the long transport from, for example, Algeria and Turkey.

116
00:14:10.040 --> 00:14:17.440
Notwithstanding if you, as Dagens Nyheter, choose to present the cement crisis as something you "should bring a pinch of salt"

117
00:14:17.440 --> 00:14:21.120
and as a battle between market forces and the environment,

118
00:14:21.120 --> 00:14:31.020
So the central problem is the constantly so careless approach to issues related to Sweden's basic infrastructure.

119
00:14:31.020 --> 00:14:36.480
It is perfectly legitimate that different social interests test their respective claims in court

120
00:14:36.480 --> 00:14:45.260
But when it comes to socially important functions such as raw material extraction and energy production, these issues must be handled in good time,

121
00:14:45.260 --> 00:14:54.340
With the necessary impact assessments and with pre -implemented new solutions for the maintenance of Swedish society.

122
00:14:54.340 --> 00:14:54.460
No God Damn Plan B. With the necessary impact assessments and with pre -implemented new solutions for the maintenance of Swedish society.

123
00:14:54.460 --> 00:14:56.360
No good damn plan B.

124
00:14:56.360 --> 00:15:05.800
For the clueless and emotionally colored arbitrariness that has long characterized Sweden's relationship with system -critical functions such as preparedness,

125
00:15:05.800 --> 00:15:15.600
Raw material and energy production testify to an idealistic ignorance that is characteristic of Kahneman's quick,

126
00:15:15.600 --> 00:15:21.200
emotional and in this case environment

127
00:15:21.200 --> 00:15:24.940
with potentially disastrous results.

128
00:15:24.940 --> 00:15:34.520
For without the long -term and rational anchoring of the sowing system, ignorant and activist ideologists' choice -handed manipulation risks manipulation

129
00:15:34.520 --> 00:15:43.120
by systems they neither understand nor have the skills to recreate to cause Swedish infrastructure irreparable damage

130
00:15:43.120 --> 00:15:48.000
But that prices are so high that paper mills close, it can be good for the environment.

131
00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:57.500
I do not criticize the ambition to care for nature, the ambition to streamline production or the intention to develop new and more sustainable technology.

132
00:15:57.500 --> 00:16:07.600
I criticize the fast, emotional and counterproductive approach that can be rightly called environmental urgent.

133
00:16:07.600 --> 00:16:18.900
Because it is very easy to house strong emotions, while reality -based decisions place high demands on knowledge and reflection.

134
00:16:18.900 --> 00:16:26.300
I now allow myself to paraphrase Gustaf Fröding's "marriage issue" in contemporary political context,

135
00:16:26.300 --> 00:16:34.000
With the extremely relevant environmental reformist question: where should you take not

136
00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:40.180
With emotion we shall defend our power so everyone can see our moral splendor

137
00:16:40.180 --> 00:16:46.980
With gender doctrine and protected climate “Stefan you!
 Märta you!
 So we should not have!

138
00:16:46.980 --> 00:16:53.180
But, Märta you, Märta you, where should we take it.
 I am too Velig and you psychopath

139
00:16:53.180 --> 00:17:01.180
The goals we discuss, they just get talk Stefan you!
 Märta you!
 Where should we go!

140
00:17:06.120 --> 00:17:14.920
And since Sweden's left has recently become unreasonably inclined to hang up on deliberate misinterpretations, here comes a fireplace:

141
00:17:14.920 --> 00:17:21.420
So I do not accuse the Environmental Party's speech tube Märta Stenevi of psychopathy.

142
00:17:21.420 --> 00:17:30.040
This is just a satirizing word that rhymes on "where should we take not" and that plays on her recurring and half -attempted attempts

143
00:17:30.040 --> 00:17:32.800
to opportunistic virtue signaling.

144
00:17:32.800 --> 00:17:39.000
Thus, there is no reason to cry out in the press and demand an excuse for my word choice.

145
00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:46.580
And then I hope that the Ledarfot finds someone else to discuss Marxist power theory.
 I can recommend Henrik Jönsson.
 Thank you Mrs. President.

146
00:17:46.580 --> 00:17:54.280
Thank you in advance for applying a rational cognitive process instead of an emotional cognitive process.

147
00:17:54.280 --> 00:18:01.680
To get foreign -born women, then, then white domestic women will also have to move.

00:18:19.580 --> 00:18:22.940
In that case I think you should share this video with your friends

00:18:22.940 --> 00:18:27.340
And why not subscribe to my Youtube channel when you're still on the move?

I appreciate all respectful communication.

153
00:18:38.540 --> 00:18:47.440
However, remember to always be polite.
 I do not accept aggression, person assembly or racism in my idea -driven comment fields.

Thank you for commenting on this.

My name is Henrik Jönsson, and I recommend a rational and more time -consuming thought work over rapid emotional reactions.
