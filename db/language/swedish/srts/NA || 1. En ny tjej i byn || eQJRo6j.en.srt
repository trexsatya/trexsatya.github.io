1
00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:09.960
Norrland - silence and calm's country part -

2
00:00:10.120 --> 00:00:13.760
- With its high mountains and deep valleys.

3
00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:20.400
But for two brothers in Sörbäcken, everyday life is neither calm nor quiet.

4
00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:26.720
Their name is Leif and Billy.

5
00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:36.760
Do you know what it is for day today?

6
00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:40.920
- My name day?
 - No, it's in the summer.

7
00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:47.840
-My birthday?
 - No, better!
 We got the a-cash!

8
00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.040
- We treat us and go to the grill.
 -Yes!

9
00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:03.760
A Parisian with extra mustard - damn what good!

10
00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:08.040
Check out, Leif, a new girl.

11
00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:13.080
-Satan, what a nice biscuit.
 - We talk to her.

12
00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:19.000
Stop and evidence!
 It's best that I talk to her first.

13
00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:24.920
- You know what to do?
 - I say that about the bear.

14
00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:28.080
Come in in three minutes.

15
00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:44.880
Yes, serve.

16
00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:51.440
Can you throw over the two million in my Russian account?

17
00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:57.000
If they do not fit, you can take on my Swedish account.

18
00:01:57.160 --> 00:02:00.040
And look over the investments.

19
00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:04.960
The luxury house in Spain ... Have they built the pool clearly?

20
00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:09.120
I'm between two meetings, so I hang up.

21
00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:15.920
We will be heard, advocate ... the auditor, the accountant's lawyer.
 Hello.

22
00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:21.800
- Yeah.
 Hello.
 - Well!

23
00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:26.680
- intervened that you have an auditor's lawyer.
 - Can you say.

24
00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:32.880
- Cool!
 -And who are you?

25
00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:37.720
I am from Stockholm.
 I'll move to Sörbäcken.

26
00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:43.840
–Sörbäcken?
 It was like hell.
 -Yes.

27
00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:49.600
-Leif Öhman!
 - What does the municipality want help with?

28
00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:55.400
- Now is there a bear in the kindergarten again?
 -A bear?!

29
00:02:55.560 --> 00:03:01.360
It is chaos.
 The children and misses have hidden in a playhouse.

30
00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:09.320
- They are terrified.
 Can you help?
 - I don't have the rifle with me.

31
00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:16.560
- You might be able to strangle it.
 -Bye.

32
00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:20.720
I must take Ferrarin and go there.

33
00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:28.560
She will move to Sörbäcken.
 We go and check what a cup it is.

34
00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:41.880
- Is she moving into the Old Table House?
 - She has gone and died.

35
00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:48.800
So the little snoser has inherited the kitchen.
 We have got a new neighbor, Billy.

36
00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:55.720
Let's see.
 Here is the reg number ...

37
00:03:55.880 --> 00:04:02.440
—Ydk 882. --... 882 ...

38
00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:09.880
"Elin Grönstedt".
 Check if she is on Facebook.

39
00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:14.800
Facebook ... Elin Grönstedt ...

40
00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:20.200
- Oh, my God, she is!
 - Yeah!

41
00:04:20.360 --> 00:04:26.320
What do we have here, then?
 She works, and lives in Stockholm ...

42
00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:31.920
- Check if she is single.
 - Yeah!

43
00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:36.760
Oh, my God, she's single!
 Stylish biscuit.

44
00:04:36.920 --> 00:04:38.880
Check...

45
00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:44.920
"Now I move into the ghost house. Square, the forest, square, Sörbäcken."

46
00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:50.560
Yes, it seems that the old marsh has gone and died.

47
00:04:52.200 --> 00:04:57.880
I got a plan.
 Get the steps, Billy.

48
00:04:58.040 --> 00:05:00.120
Yes Yes.

49
00:05:01.920 --> 00:05:07.040
Hi, Little Gåskorven, have you moved to Sörbäcken?

50
00:05:07.200 --> 00:05:10.800
Now you should meet Leif-Inator.

51
00:05:21.040 --> 00:05:24.600
THERES A KNOCK ON THE DOOR

52
00:05:28.760 --> 00:05:34.360
Hello?
 After all, you are!
 I saw you at the pizzeria today.

53
00:05:34.520 --> 00:05:42.360
I was in passing and wanted to say hello to the new neighbor.

54
00:05:42.520 --> 00:05:48.760
-Hello!
 Elin.
 - Billy.
 Nice.

55
00:05:48.920 --> 00:05:55.040
So you have moved into this old ghost truck?

56
00:05:55.200 --> 00:06:04.000
It's my grandmother's old house.
 A little weird maybe, but no danger.

57
00:06:04.160 --> 00:06:08.400
I would probably be a little careful.

58
00:06:08.560 --> 00:06:13.320
There are a lot of old stories about this horror.

59
00:06:13.480 --> 00:06:19.080
A lot of guests and demons who get around here -

60
00:06:19.240 --> 00:06:22.840
- So I usually go a detour.

61
00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:28.040
But there lives a man over there named Leif Öhman -

62
00:06:28.200 --> 00:06:32.760
- As has contact with the other side.

63
00:06:32.920 --> 00:06:37.600
-A medium?
 - Just that - medium.

64
00:06:37.760 --> 00:06:41.360
He can help with the guests.

65
00:06:41.520 --> 00:06:46.880
- But now I'll go.
 - Thanks for tips.

66
00:06:47.040 --> 00:06:50.800
-See you.
 -Hello.

67
00:06:53.520 --> 00:06:56.320
Oh my God.

68
00:07:03.720 --> 00:07:07.720
THERES A KNOCK ON THE DOOR

69
00:07:07.720 --> 00:07:11.560
-Hello.
 –Leif Öhman.

70
00:07:11.720 --> 00:07:17.800
We met at the pizzeria today.
 The millionaire that strangles bears.

71
00:07:17.960 --> 00:07:23.560
- You might be medium too?
 -That's right.

72
00:07:23.720 --> 00:07:30.880
I could feel dark forces all the way from the house.
 Oh oh oh...

73
00:07:32.240 --> 00:07:34.480
Okay.

74
00:07:39.080 --> 00:07:43.280
Oh oh oh.
 - The spirits, take it easy now.

75
00:07:43.440 --> 00:07:48.720
I'm here to convey peace, I don't want any conflict.

76
00:07:48.880 --> 00:07:53.280
These spirits, what exactly do they want?

77
00:07:53.440 --> 00:07:57.560
I'll try to contact them.

78
00:08:03.400 --> 00:08:07.200
Now it's one here.
 - Calm ... Hello ... Hello ...

79
00:08:07.360 --> 00:08:14.040
They say you will find the love of your life here in Sörbäcken.

80
00:08:14.200 --> 00:08:16.720
Who then?

81
00:08:19.240 --> 00:08:27.000
He is 35 years old, likes fishing and hunting and his name is ... Leif.

82
00:08:27.160 --> 00:08:31.800
But who is she you talk to?

83
00:08:31.960 --> 00:08:35.920
Her name is Anna-Greta.
 She is behind the cabinet.

84
00:08:36.080 --> 00:08:42.440
Anna-Greta?
 What a coincidence!
 My grandmother is called Anna-Greta.

85
00:08:42.600 --> 00:08:46.280
She is the one who contacts me.

86
00:08:47.480 --> 00:08:51.920
Okay!
 Damn what cool!

87
00:08:52.080 --> 00:08:58.560
- Can you talk to Grandma?
 - I should try.

88
00:09:00.480 --> 00:09:04.760
If you hear me now, give me a sign.
 Anything.

89
00:09:04.920 --> 00:09:08.120
Give us a sign.

90
00:09:09.600 --> 00:09:13.520
Shit, what scary!

91
00:09:13.680 --> 00:09:17.960
Did you hear?
 It sounds like there is someone up there.

92
00:09:18.120 --> 00:09:21.720
-We go there.
 - Well ...

93
00:09:21.880 --> 00:09:28.640
Calm down, the spirits!
 Now we come up!
 We do not want conflict.

94
00:09:28.800 --> 00:09:31.680
The spirits, do you hear me?

95
00:09:36.280 --> 00:09:42.320
Oh oh oh!
 You can really feel that there is something up here.

96
00:09:42.480 --> 00:09:48.840
- Yes, it's best that we go down again.
 - Is Grandma left up here?

97
00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:53.720
It's a demon in here.

98
00:09:53.880 --> 00:10:00.920
"Demon Man! Don't Hurt The Little Red Head Lady, She's Not Made of Fire."

99
00:10:01.080 --> 00:10:04.280
"She's an Angel Without Wings."

100
00:10:04.440 --> 00:10:07.280
Now I'm going to talk to Grandma.

101
00:10:10.720 --> 00:10:16.880
Go to the light, Anna-Greta.
 Go in there in the loop.
 Good, Anna-Greta!

102
00:10:17.960 --> 00:10:23.880
-So.
 Now she is in peace.
 Now we go down.
 - The demon is left.

103
00:10:28.120 --> 00:10:33.680
A demon!
 He is strong!
 "He's trying to kill me!"

104
00:10:44.800 --> 00:10:49.320
"Move! Never come back, demon face!"

105
00:10:49.480 --> 00:10:55.000
- Now the demon is gone.
 - Yes, now we go down.

106
00:10:57.280 --> 00:11:00.240
- Now the spirits are expelled from the house.
 - Great!

107
00:11:00.400 --> 00:11:08.160
- Remember what the spirits said.
 - It is there by finding a man ...

108
00:11:08.320 --> 00:11:16.440
I will think about it.

109
00:11:16.600 --> 00:11:23.000
Thanks, Leif.
 Thanks for your little ritual.

110
00:11:23.160 --> 00:11:29.280
Just get over to me if you need help.
 Bye.

111
00:11:31.760 --> 00:11:34.520
What the hell?

112
00:11:38.600 --> 00:11:43.440
You are a genius, Billy.
 Women want security.

113
00:11:43.600 --> 00:11:48.680
Who is her security now?
 Yes, Leif Öhman.

114
00:11:48.840 --> 00:11:54.920
Soon I have a little wife running around and cuddles with me.

115
00:11:55.080 --> 00:12:00.800
Damn, Satan ... - Yes, who knows.

116
00:12:01.440 --> 00:12:06.760
Oh, Jesus!
 Look into Elin's window!

117
00:12:08.040 --> 00:12:13.440
- I aroused the dear from the dead!
 - What the hell are we going to do?

118
00:12:13.600 --> 00:12:17.040
We have to warn Elin.

119
00:12:19.840 --> 00:12:25.400
- Hi, that's Elin.
 - I had some strong forces in me.

120
00:12:25.560 --> 00:12:32.120
-What are you talking about?
 - I woke up Grandma from the dead.

121
00:12:32.280 --> 00:12:39.000
- You have to get out of the kitchen right away!
 - Do you mean this grandmother?

122
00:12:43.520 --> 00:12:49.480
-What the hell?
 --Leif, she's no spirit.

123
00:12:49.640 --> 00:12:53.160
- We thought she was dead.
 -Death?

124
00:12:53.320 --> 00:12:56.600
We haven't seen her in a long time.

125
00:12:56.760 --> 00:13:03.200
She got a stroke last fall, so she's most indoors.

126
00:13:03.360 --> 00:13:09.200
- She's not dead.
 -I must go...

127
00:13:09.360 --> 00:13:16.760
I just want to thank you so much for the Sea today.
 It was rewarding.

128
00:13:16.920 --> 00:13:20.440
It's burning here now.
 Hello.

129
00:13:20.600 --> 00:13:25.000
Oh my God!
 Do you pick up like this in Norrland?

130
00:13:26.760 --> 00:13:31.920
Yes you, Leif ... good luck getting her to wife.
