1
00:00:01.080 --> 00:00:04.000
Was there anyone who wanted a big one?

2
00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:07.040
Damn!
 Oh oh oh.

3
00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:22.120
What a fantastic day here in Fjällbacka in Bohuslän.

4
00:00:22.280 --> 00:00:25.440
I'm going to meet my friend Sofia B. Olsson -

5
00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:29.200
- As will guide me among the raw materials in this region.

6
00:00:29.360 --> 00:00:35.120
Then we go out to Kalvö and meet Åsa, who is an oyster farmer.

7
00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:41.800
Sofia and I, who is also a chef, will be allowed to test two kinds of oysters:

8
00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:45.520
The invasive Japanese oyster, also called gigas-

9
00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:49.480
- And so the Swedish classic oyster Edulis.

10
00:00:58.720 --> 00:01:02.960
Welcome to Kalvö!
 Hey you.

11
00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:08.680
We have an oyster bank from the 17th century.

12
00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:14.600
An oyster bank must be managed, it can't just lie there and die out.

13
00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:17.200
We are much like ordinary farmers.

14
00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:21.360
We are thinning, moving oysters so that they are not on each other -

15
00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:26.600
- We look at how they feel and so, of course, we harvest them.

16
00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:29.800
Then we will see if the waders fit.

17
00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:33.840
We must have them when we pick oysters.

18
00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:42.080
Are we done?
 Then we go and pick some oysters.

19
00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:49.240
-What should we do?
 - Now we will look for gigas.

20
00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:54.640
It is quite difficult, because now there is a little sand over them.

21
00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:57.160
Then it is great with the water binoculars.

22
00:01:57.320 --> 00:02:00.760
You go ahead, stop and push it down.

23
00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:06.680
When the sand settles you look clearly and then you pick up gigs.

24
00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:17.880
I want some bautastor too.

25
00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:30.760
Every oyster is like a work of art.

26
00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:41.840
- Now my bucket is full.
 - Yes, it looks fully.

27
00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:46.160
Don't forget that we should pick Edulis as well.

28
00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:49.560
We have prepared a bit, because they are at 13 meters otherwise.

29
00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:54.760
I thought we would not have to go down to 13 meters today.

30
00:02:54.920 --> 00:03:00.240
You can take the blue tamp, so you get to work a little.
 Oyster farmer for a day.

31
00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:03.160
I may need to fight a little.

32
00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:07.280
Here we have them, yes.

33
00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:13.440
This is the Swedish, Ostrea Edulis, which is the origin of the origin for us here.

34
00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:19.120
They have been here for thousands of years, long before the gigas came.

35
00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:21.600
So now we have two kinds of oysters.

36
00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:28.040
Before cooking, we take a trip around the island and look for more ingredients.

37
00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:32.520
- Here we have beach cabbage.
 - Look, how nice.

38
00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:39.640
Fresh and fine.
 But you can't pick everywhere now, huh?

39
00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:44.280
No, they are protected in some landscapes-

40
00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:48.960
- But here in Bohuslän you can pick beach cabbage.

41
00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:58.080
--Wow!
 –Shit, what a view.

42
00:04:16.920 --> 00:04:23.520
I would like you to tell you more about your passion for these wild ...

43
00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:26.520
... new, invasive, oysters.

44
00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:30.640
Is it something I love to talk about, that's it.

45
00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:33.440
They came here a couple of years ago.

46
00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:37.600
It was very much: "The Japanese giant cheese invades."

47
00:04:37.760 --> 00:04:42.400
"They threaten the domestic oysters and mussels."

48
00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:49.520
But after a while I thought they are damn like the French oysters -

49
00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:54.640
- As everyone loves, and realized that it is exactly the same species.

50
00:04:54.800 --> 00:04:59.400
Then it gets really interesting.
 We have oysters here on our coast -

51
00:04:59.560 --> 00:05:04.040
- As no one wants to be in the water, and no one eats them ...

52
00:05:04.200 --> 00:05:08.360
At the same time as we import type 6,000 tonnes of French of the same species -

53
00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:10.760
- To Swedish restaurants every year.

54
00:05:10.920 --> 00:05:15.920
It's not logical.
 We have to use these oysters.

55
00:05:17.280 --> 00:05:21.760
Sofia works a lot with Japanese flavors, and tops her raw oysters -

56
00:05:21.920 --> 00:05:26.240
- With
 Algae, sour soy sauce, apples and honeysuckle flower.

57
00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:29.760
They become a snack when the guests arrive.

58
00:05:29.920 --> 00:05:33.880
I myself make a chilled soup with almond potatoes and leeks -

59
00:05:34.040 --> 00:05:38.560
- As I taste with oysters and tops with, among other things.
 beach cabbage and apple.

60
00:05:38.720 --> 00:05:42.800
Hope that our oyster -loving guests will like our ideas.

61
00:05:42.960 --> 00:05:45.600
I want guests now.

62
00:05:54.760 --> 00:05:58.320
-Welcome!
 - Welcome out.

63
00:05:58.480 --> 00:06:02.880
We have controlled some lovely oysters.

64
00:06:07.200 --> 00:06:11.800
It was delicious.
 You knew all the flavors.

65
00:06:20.760 --> 00:06:25.560
–What do you have with you now?
 - Now I come with the soup.

66
00:06:25.720 --> 00:06:30.600
I made it with almond potatoes and flavored it with oysters:

67
00:06:30.760 --> 00:06:34.680
Mixed a lot of raw oysters in it.

68
00:06:34.840 --> 00:06:37.720
What flavors!
 Fantastic.

69
00:06:37.880 --> 00:06:40.120
It is fun to show that the oyster -

70
00:06:40.280 --> 00:06:44.400
- So can act as a flavoring, and not just be in their shell.

71
00:06:44.560 --> 00:06:46.400
It wasn't stupid.

72
00:06:46.560 --> 00:06:52.040
I would never have been able to find that myself.
 It's really amazing.

73
00:06:52.200 --> 00:06:58.680
The guests seem satisfied, but we have an ace in the rock sleeve - grilled oysters.

74
00:07:00.760 --> 00:07:03.720
-Oh!
 --Wow.

75
00:07:03.880 --> 00:07:07.120
Now comes the last serving of the oysters -

76
00:07:07.280 --> 00:07:11.600
- Which is grilled in their own shell.
 They get a great taste.

77
00:07:11.760 --> 00:07:16.720
Then some other shades emerge.
 A little more nutty and more sweet.

78
00:07:22.920 --> 00:07:28.000
A smoky, amazing taste.
 Mums!

79
00:07:38.280 --> 00:07:42.960
- Are you satisfied with the food?
 -Absolutely.
 It was fun cooking.

80
00:07:43.120 --> 00:07:47.120
Pretty simple, pretty much raw material.
 It was fun.

81
00:07:47.280 --> 00:07:51.200
- They seem very satisfied.
 -Really.

82
00:07:51.360 --> 00:07:57.360
Now you want to move to Bohuslän.
 Is it always like this?

83
00:07:58.400 --> 00:08:01.240
I agree with you.
