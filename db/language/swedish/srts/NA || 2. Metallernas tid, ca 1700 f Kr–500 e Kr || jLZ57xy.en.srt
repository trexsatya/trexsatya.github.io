1
00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:47.400
The attackers will not show any consideration.

2
00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:49.560
A brutal assault.

3
00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:54.840
What happens inside the walls tonight affects the islanders for generations.

4
00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:06.160
We are now in the time of the metals- the Bronze and Iron Age.

5
00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:12.400
The hunt for metals causes chiefs and warriors to leave the Stone Age -

6
00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:16.480
- And go out in Europe on long and risky trips.

7
00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:24.840
And what they bring home is changing the lives of everyone in our country.

8
00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:29.320
It is also a story full of violence and war.

9
00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:43.360
This is the story of our country.

10
00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:47.840
About the people and forces that have shaped it -

11
00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.440
- Endure from the ice age until our days.

12
00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:10.280
This is the story of Sweden.

13
00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:41.200
The Bronze Age, a mythical era that lasts in Scandinavia for 1,200 years.

14
00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:46.720
No written sources are found -

15
00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:52.360
- But the people who lived then have left traces in many places.

16
00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:58.160
It's about magnificent burial chamber ...

17
00:02:58.320 --> 00:03:01.240
... enigmatic rock carvings ...

18
00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:06.400
... and about things left in graves or sacrificed in lakes.

19
00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:11.440
It is tracks that tell about a time when bronze changes life here.

20
00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:52.960
At this time, a young woman with a boat comes from Europe.

21
00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:58.440
Her trip takes her to the Tierp district in northern Uppland.

22
00:03:58.600 --> 00:04:02.360
There you will find her grave several thousand years later

23
00:04:02.520 --> 00:04:08.440
–And the gifts she brought with her death - the Tierp woman ...

24
00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:20.000
During the Bronze Age, prominent women move far from home and family.

25
00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:27.360
It is thus a marriage system that you call Exogami.

26
00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:32.080
The men mostly remain -

27
00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:39.360
- But the women are embraced and move into the man's family's household.

28
00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:44.760
Thanks to DNA, we can say with certainty - -

29
00:04:44.920 --> 00:04:48.560
- The women come from somewhere else.

30
00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:51.480
Some come from Germany.

31
00:04:51.640 --> 00:04:57.680
In northern Germany there are signs of women who have come from Hungary.

32
00:04:57.840 --> 00:05:05.840
At the early Bronze Age, this pattern dominates all over Europe.

33
00:05:07.040 --> 00:05:13.000
Marrying into a family with power is a way to create alliances.

34
00:05:14.920 --> 00:05:18.800
Alliances are needed in war, but also for trade.

35
00:05:18.960 --> 00:05:23.520
During the Bronze Age, trade in metals is absolutely necessary.

36
00:05:23.680 --> 00:05:26.760
So these alliances are of great importance.

37
00:05:27.960 --> 00:05:31.440
In Scandinavia, when we look at the objects in the graves -

38
00:05:31.600 --> 00:05:35.720
- So men are most visible, and they usually have the most wealth.

39
00:05:35.880 --> 00:05:42.360
This indicates that it is patriarchal during the Bronze Age on the whole.

40
00:05:42.520 --> 00:05:48.880
But there are things that indicate that those who come in with new knowledge -

41
00:05:49.040 --> 00:05:51.960
- In principle, women are during the Bronze Age.

42
00:05:52.120 --> 00:05:56.480
There were women who could have incredibly prominent positions -

43
00:05:56.640 --> 00:06:01.440
- Not only religious and ritually, but also politically.

44
00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:12.000
Most people were farmers in the Bronze Age.

45
00:06:12.160 --> 00:06:15.680
But the Tierp woman belongs to the top layer of society.

46
00:06:15.840 --> 00:06:21.440
The shiny bronze objects she has must be an impressive sight -

47
00:06:21.600 --> 00:06:24.680
- But her clothes are also unusual.

48
00:06:31.800 --> 00:06:35.000
In the Bronze Age, Wool was the new.

49
00:06:35.160 --> 00:06:41.920
They dressed in coarse woolen garments, but it was the new, expensive.

50
00:06:42.080 --> 00:06:45.600
Only the upper class dressed in those garments.

51
00:06:51.920 --> 00:06:56.920
The Tierp Woman's most unique objects are the six pendants.

52
00:06:57.080 --> 00:06:59.840
It is not Nordic objects.

53
00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:05.200
They probably come from the Lüneburg area in Germany.

54
00:07:05.360 --> 00:07:09.600
It is an area that has strong contacts with Scandinavia.

55
00:07:09.760 --> 00:07:13.360
It is very likely that the Tierp woman will come from here.

56
00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:21.480
Bronze causes you to travel far, marriage and alliances are included in Europe.

57
00:07:23.200 --> 00:07:26.200
There is a huge demand for bronze.

58
00:07:26.360 --> 00:07:32.240
It is a product that is used for so many different things in society.

59
00:07:33.520 --> 00:07:39.360
The bronze is a fuel that drives society to completely new levels.

60
00:07:39.520 --> 00:07:42.280
The important thing with bronze-

61
00:07:42.440 --> 00:07:48.680
- Is it being used in jewelry, implements and weapons.

62
00:07:48.840 --> 00:07:51.880
Very quickly it becomes necessary.

63
00:07:52.040 --> 00:07:57.200
Bronze is made from copper and tin, which is not extracted in the Nordic countries -

64
00:07:57.360 --> 00:08:00.800
- The outer must be imported from Europe.

65
00:08:00.960 --> 00:08:05.080
To do that, you need to build a commercial network.

66
00:08:05.240 --> 00:08:09.800
Tierp's large village is strategically located in northern Uppland-

67
00:08:09.960 --> 00:08:13.560
- With control over the fur exports of the Norrland coast.

68
00:08:13.720 --> 00:08:20.280
They had contacts against both north and south, and built up wealth.

69
00:08:20.440 --> 00:08:25.440
It became attractive, and can explain why the Tierp woman ended up here.

70
00:08:34.200 --> 00:08:38.520
The upper class desire for bronze is almost insatiable.

71
00:08:38.680 --> 00:08:45.080
It is always needed more, as the dead bring this in the graves.

72
00:08:45.240 --> 00:08:50.040
Many bronze objects are also sacrificed in different ceremonies.

73
00:09:18.960 --> 00:09:23.720
Sacriving things is a way to get the higher powers friendly.

74
00:09:38.560 --> 00:09:44.400
You put the sacrificial gifts in watercourses such as swamp, marshes and lakes.

75
00:09:44.560 --> 00:09:49.320
Probably the water is perceived as a gate to the world of the gods.

76
00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:54.960
An exciting detail is that you often sacrifice things in pairs.

77
00:10:07.200 --> 00:10:12.400
Twin gods and the twin theme are central to the Bronze Age.

78
00:10:14.280 --> 00:10:20.000
This is an expression of this particular duality in reality.

79
00:10:22.320 --> 00:10:26.280
That there are two sides of everything.
 Good and bad...

80
00:10:26.440 --> 00:10:29.920
... sun and moon, light and darkness, life and death.

81
00:10:30.080 --> 00:10:34.160
These forces are needed to create balance in existence.

82
00:10:36.520 --> 00:10:42.720
We can see it in rock carving motifs and in bronze objects such as neck collars -

83
00:10:42.880 --> 00:10:47.160
- In pair, abandoned axes and other objects.

84
00:10:51.600 --> 00:10:56.520
By adding two, you both reach these phenomena.

85
00:10:58.800 --> 00:11:04.400
You do not have to choose, but create a balance between the two all the time.

86
00:11:09.840 --> 00:11:15.840
A recurring rock carving motif is people who make volts.

87
00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:21.440
It is believed that they show a ritual dance performed by women.

88
00:11:21.600 --> 00:11:24.680
Most often you do volts over ships.

89
00:11:24.840 --> 00:11:30.040
There are also bronze figures where we see these back volts.

90
00:11:30.200 --> 00:11:33.200
Then we can see that women do the volts.

91
00:11:33.360 --> 00:11:37.760
They have a special lace skirt that makes them easy to identify.

92
00:11:51.640 --> 00:11:57.080
There is some kind of priestesses in a priesthood cult of some kind.

93
00:12:02.080 --> 00:12:06.040
It can be about jumping between worlds.

94
00:12:06.200 --> 00:12:09.200
It can be about overcoming fear.

95
00:12:09.360 --> 00:12:11.720
It is a ritual act.

96
00:12:43.800 --> 00:12:48.320
One thing that happens during the Bronze Age is that agriculture develops.

97
00:12:48.480 --> 00:12:51.880
New cereals provide better harvests -

98
00:12:52.040 --> 00:12:55.800
- What means that the landowners become richer.

99
00:12:55.960 --> 00:13:01.240
This, in turn, means that they can bet their riches on long travel -

100
00:13:01.400 --> 00:13:06.040
- And change copper and tin to make bronze.

101
00:13:06.200 --> 00:13:10.760
These communities build their entire structure and logic on -

102
00:13:10.920 --> 00:13:16.840
- To try to realize as long -distance trading as possible with the boats.

103
00:13:21.720 --> 00:13:27.160
Boat trips south walk along the coasts and rivers in Europe.

104
00:13:28.240 --> 00:13:31.160
The fast transport leaders of the time -

105
00:13:31.320 --> 00:13:35.720
- Takes the crews to the trading venues on the continent.

106
00:13:38.160 --> 00:13:42.680
We think it took 15-20 days to get to England.

107
00:13:42.840 --> 00:13:46.040
There you could change both tin and copper.

108
00:13:46.200 --> 00:13:50.360
To northern Spain it took maybe 30-35 days.

109
00:13:50.520 --> 00:13:54.600
However, all this requires good weather conditions.

110
00:13:55.800 --> 00:14:00.160
Investigations have shown that the copper in Scandinavian Bronze Age finds -

111
00:14:00.320 --> 00:14:03.560
- Comes all the way from Cyprus and Spain.

112
00:14:05.280 --> 00:14:08.520
18 bronze shields were excavated in the 1980s.

113
00:14:08.680 --> 00:14:12.000
There is no counterpart throughout Europe.

114
00:14:12.160 --> 00:14:17.600
Analyzes have shown that the copper in those shields comes from Spain.

115
00:14:17.760 --> 00:14:23.400
It shows that we were then part of an important Atlantic trading system.

116
00:14:25.720 --> 00:14:30.040
Many trips also go to different trading venues in Germany -

117
00:14:30.200 --> 00:14:34.080
- Where you change copper and fabrics.

118
00:14:42.400 --> 00:14:47.880
The sword has served as a kind of Bronze Age pass.

119
00:14:48.720 --> 00:14:52.560
Someone comes with his sword, you know:

120
00:14:52.720 --> 00:14:57.760
"You are part of the Brotherhood, you have the right to pass."

121
00:14:57.920 --> 00:15:02.800
"You can get night shelters and food here."
 It's a passport.

122
00:15:20.880 --> 00:15:26.480
It may seem strange that you could talk to each other in near and far.

123
00:15:26.640 --> 00:15:32.280
But in large parts of Northern Europe, a very similar language was spoken.

124
00:15:32.440 --> 00:15:37.040
It is based on the Indo -European language that was one and the same -

125
00:15:37.200 --> 00:15:44.240
- And spread across Europe in the migrations of stone and Bronze Age from the east.

126
00:15:56.920 --> 00:16:00.320
Not only does the bronze make us Norwegians travel.

127
00:16:00.480 --> 00:16:05.720
Wool, yarn and textiles are also an important part of the economy and trade.

128
00:16:12.760 --> 00:16:16.480
In the Bronze Age, wool was valuable.

129
00:16:16.640 --> 00:16:19.600
A simple garment can take five months to do.

130
00:16:19.760 --> 00:16:25.800
There are text sources that show that raw, untreated wool costs ...

131
00:16:25.960 --> 00:16:32.120
60 kg wool costs about as much as 30 kg copper.

132
00:16:38.520 --> 00:16:44.800
In the trade in copper, tin and wool, Norwegians often have amber -

133
00:16:44.960 --> 00:16:50.840
- But also beeswax, honey, dried meat, hides and fur.

134
00:17:04.960 --> 00:17:09.200
But not only did they devote themselves to trading on the trips south.

135
00:17:18.160 --> 00:17:22.200
On the trips you also capture slaves -

136
00:17:22.360 --> 00:17:26.480
- As you either sell or take home as a labor force.

137
00:17:29.360 --> 00:17:34.640
Much of the expeditions, which have been regarded as trade expeditions ...

138
00:17:34.800 --> 00:17:38.400
Some are certainly pure frame slave.

139
00:17:42.080 --> 00:17:47.760
The slaves have a huge significance, which has previously been underestimated.

140
00:17:47.920 --> 00:17:52.760
The society we see in the Bronze Age is a hierarchical chief society.

141
00:17:52.920 --> 00:17:58.160
It was a lot about controlling the import of bronze -

142
00:17:58.320 --> 00:18:03.040
- And to be able to move people from the farms to the boats.

143
00:18:03.200 --> 00:18:05.840
Make them a warrior on the boats.

144
00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:10.520
This created a void in society, mainly on the farms.

145
00:18:10.680 --> 00:18:14.840
Therefore, you have slaves who can manage the farm chores -

146
00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:17.560
- At all different levels.

147
00:18:17.720 --> 00:18:22.400
We would not have the Bronze Age unreasonable labor.

148
00:18:36.480 --> 00:18:40.440
We do not know how long the Tierp woman and her husband live.

149
00:18:42.400 --> 00:18:45.200
Nor what they die from.

150
00:19:01.920 --> 00:19:07.280
She receives a funeral that arises the elite during the Bronze Age.

151
00:19:10.640 --> 00:19:16.040
Over 3,000 years later, the archaeologists find her remains -

152
00:19:16.200 --> 00:19:19.080
- And the gifts she brings with her in death.

153
00:19:21.080 --> 00:19:25.320
The Tierp woman has been buried unburned-

154
00:19:25.480 --> 00:19:28.560
- In an oak coffin that has since been laid in a pile.

155
00:19:28.720 --> 00:19:33.800
Then you have been buried in their finest costume with their jewelry.

156
00:19:42.880 --> 00:19:46.240
The Tierp woman has certainly belonged to the richest family.

157
00:19:46.400 --> 00:19:51.080
An important woman in this area during the Bronze Age.

158
00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:05.720
A few hundred years after her death, the chief of the chief has lost its position.

159
00:20:05.880 --> 00:20:09.400
The land increase causes you to lose the sea contact.

160
00:20:09.560 --> 00:20:14.680
Almost nothing from the later Bronze Age has been found in the Tierp district.

161
00:20:19.920 --> 00:20:27.440
Now a powerful kingdom arises a few miles south of Tierp, in Håga.

162
00:20:50.720 --> 00:20:54.880
The tracks from that kingdom are still there today.

163
00:20:55.040 --> 00:21:00.600
Hågahögen is one of the most magnificent graves we have in Sweden.

164
00:21:19.400 --> 00:21:25.200
The finds in the burial mound tells us about the lives of people and religion-

165
00:21:25.360 --> 00:21:29.800
- But also about the enormous wealth the powerful in society has.

166
00:21:30.960 --> 00:21:37.360
The grave was full of beautiful objects of both bronze and gold.

167
00:21:37.520 --> 00:21:43.120
Hågahögen is the golden -rich grave from the Bronze Age in all of Scandinavia.

168
00:21:43.280 --> 00:21:48.760
The person buried in Hågahögen must have had a very high status.

169
00:21:48.920 --> 00:21:53.600
Some sort of chief or small king or so-

170
00:21:53.760 --> 00:21:57.880
- With contacts across large parts of Europe.

171
00:21:58.040 --> 00:22:00.920
We see that on the objects in the grave.

172
00:22:01.080 --> 00:22:05.160
So this is the outermost elite, simply.

173
00:22:19.640 --> 00:22:25.880
In Håga, you can see a sveavartic emerging in the 12th century BC.

174
00:22:26.040 --> 00:22:32.360
It expands and dominates trade on the Baltic Sea for hundreds of years.

175
00:22:32.520 --> 00:22:37.760
At the same time, you see that this is happening in other ways in other parts of Sweden.

176
00:22:37.920 --> 00:22:42.760
Tanum may have been the center of a empire in western Sweden.

177
00:22:42.920 --> 00:22:47.600
And Kivik seems to be the center of a larger empire in the south.

178
00:22:53.440 --> 00:22:59.560
The empire with the center of Kivik has been powerful since the older Bronze Age.

179
00:22:59.720 --> 00:23:02.760
Something we can see traces of today.

180
00:23:17.720 --> 00:23:22.400
Kivik is the gate facing Europe and bronze trade.

181
00:23:22.560 --> 00:23:28.880
Here, overlooking the Gulf of Hanö, there is a powerful tomb monument.

182
00:23:43.840 --> 00:23:50.080
Here inside the burial chamber there is a pouring chest, full of rock carvings.

183
00:23:50.240 --> 00:23:54.040
The carvings represent axes and ships ...

184
00:23:54.200 --> 00:23:59.200
... four -legged animals, people and wind instruments.

185
00:24:01.280 --> 00:24:04.960
The rock carvings in the Kiviksgraven are outstanding in its kind.

186
00:24:05.120 --> 00:24:08.600
Actually without equivalent in the other rock carvings.

187
00:24:08.760 --> 00:24:14.200
Interesting is the image of a two-wheeled combat or race car.

188
00:24:14.360 --> 00:24:17.000
The oldest of its kind in northern Europe -

189
00:24:17.160 --> 00:24:23.360
- Listed just a few centuries after the type of carriage was introduced.

190
00:24:24.840 --> 00:24:31.200
The person who made the Kiviksgraven and carved these pictures ...

191
00:24:31.360 --> 00:24:36.040
I think Kivikshövingen was very powerful.

192
00:24:42.720 --> 00:24:49.720
This type of magnificent monument is signs of the power the leaders have.

193
00:24:51.320 --> 00:24:56.920
These communities are most powerful 800 years before our era.

194
00:24:59.480 --> 00:25:03.600
There are conflicts and warfare between these centers of power.

195
00:25:03.760 --> 00:25:06.520
A constant struggle to expand.

196
00:25:06.680 --> 00:25:11.760
Warfare, antagonism and violence between these different regions.

197
00:25:28.080 --> 00:25:31.880
This man has become known as the Granhammarsman.

198
00:25:33.160 --> 00:25:38.760
Sometime at this time he travels from Östra Skåne to Mälardalen.

199
00:25:42.920 --> 00:25:46.840
A journey that will end with his death.

200
00:25:52.280 --> 00:26:00.080
In 1953, after 2,700 years, the remains of his body are found on a field.

201
00:26:01.040 --> 00:26:05.320
The site is Granhammar, a couple of miles northwest of Stockholm.

202
00:26:05.480 --> 00:26:08.600
It is an exceptional find.

203
00:26:08.760 --> 00:26:13.960
In addition to objects, intact skeletons from this time are unusual.

204
00:26:15.400 --> 00:26:19.160
It's like a frozen moment.

205
00:26:19.320 --> 00:26:25.520
Next to the skeleton, several implements have been preserved: a flint scraper ...

206
00:26:25.680 --> 00:26:30.520
... a bronze chisel, a bronze plate, and several benzulas.

207
00:26:30.680 --> 00:26:36.960
Everything indicates that the man used to repair different types of equipment.

208
00:26:37.120 --> 00:26:42.240
With DNA and today's advanced analytics technology of skeleton and teeth -

209
00:26:42.400 --> 00:26:47.760
- Can we now find out where and how the Granhammarsman lived his life.

210
00:26:52.680 --> 00:26:57.480
The Granhammarsman is born in southern Sweden, north of Skåne -

211
00:26:57.640 --> 00:27:03.040
- And grows up on a farm, perhaps in the Småland forests.

212
00:27:12.800 --> 00:27:17.120
From the age of seven we can follow what the Granhammarsman ate.

213
00:27:17.280 --> 00:27:20.280
As a boy he ate meat.

214
00:27:20.440 --> 00:27:25.360
It is likely that he lived on a farm with livestock management.

215
00:27:25.520 --> 00:27:32.040
We compare an early and a later tooth we can see that Granhammarsmann -

216
00:27:32.200 --> 00:27:36.840
- Moved at least a few miles when he was ten years old.

217
00:27:42.520 --> 00:27:47.440
Investigations of the skeleton show that he moved again as an adult.

218
00:27:47.600 --> 00:27:51.720
Then he ended up in eastern Skåne, in the Kristianstads area.

219
00:27:51.880 --> 00:27:59.320
That he moved often indicates that he was not well -ordered farmer -

220
00:27:59.480 --> 00:28:03.040
- Out he was a second -hand figure, maybe a boy.

221
00:28:06.960 --> 00:28:13.680
Wear in the right arm shows that he has been doing monotonous work.

222
00:28:16.280 --> 00:28:21.240
And something exciting is that the teeth are worn out in a way that shows -

223
00:28:21.400 --> 00:28:25.520
- That he may have twisted arch strings, chewed skins and other things.

224
00:28:25.680 --> 00:28:29.280
Possibly he has been a leather craftsman -

225
00:28:29.440 --> 00:28:33.160
- But I also think he has participated in battles.

226
00:28:42.520 --> 00:28:49.520
When the Granhammarsman is around 50 years, he has reached Mälardalen.

227
00:29:12.640 --> 00:29:18.480
For a long time, it was believed that the Bronze Age people lived quietly in peace.

228
00:29:18.640 --> 00:29:20.960
But that picture does not seem to be true.

229
00:29:28.000 --> 00:29:34.480
Instead, much indicates that the time was strongly characterized by violence.

230
00:29:41.080 --> 00:29:45.480
In fact, we find traces in Scandinavia and the whole of Europe -

231
00:29:45.640 --> 00:29:50.120
- As testifies to brutal violence, warfare and conflict.

232
00:29:57.120 --> 00:30:02.280
In the middle of Bohuslän Brastad there is a unique rock carving.

233
00:30:02.440 --> 00:30:07.720
Here we have one of the few examples in the Nordic countries from this time -

234
00:30:07.880 --> 00:30:12.280
- At fight scenes, where you probably see a murder.

235
00:30:13.840 --> 00:30:18.640
A warrior drives a spear in the trunk of another that holds a hood.

236
00:30:29.520 --> 00:30:35.080
For the first time in Swedish history, we see the emergence of a war class.

237
00:30:35.240 --> 00:30:37.920
We do not see that in previous phases.

238
00:30:38.080 --> 00:30:43.240
We see this in rock carvings, graves and weapons.

239
00:31:04.200 --> 00:31:09.640
The Granhammarsman becomes one of those affected by the brutal violence of the time.

240
00:31:37.600 --> 00:31:40.880
The most startling with this skeleton -

241
00:31:41.040 --> 00:31:45.200
- Is there are violent tracks, and not so little either.

242
00:31:45.360 --> 00:31:48.240
He has several ax cuts on his left arm.

243
00:31:50.800 --> 00:31:54.200
The last chop has cut off half the face.

244
00:31:54.360 --> 00:31:59.160
He has been involved in an ax duel on life and death-

245
00:31:59.320 --> 00:32:01.920
- And lost the battle.

246
00:32:07.760 --> 00:32:11.760
We don't know what the Granhammarsman did so far from home -

247
00:32:11.920 --> 00:32:14.680
- nor why he is killed.

248
00:32:15.880 --> 00:32:21.760
But he dies at a time when life in the Nordic countries will soon change again.

249
00:32:22.560 --> 00:32:25.840
The days of the Bronze Age are counted.

250
00:32:26.000 --> 00:32:29.120
For now comes a new metal - the iron.

251
00:32:59.200 --> 00:33:04.960
The iron is a little everywhere in nature - in lakes and marshes.

252
00:33:05.120 --> 00:33:09.760
In watercourses like this you can find red soil, with iron in.

253
00:33:22.040 --> 00:33:25.680
Because the iron is so common and easy to make -

254
00:33:25.840 --> 00:33:30.000
- It competes out the trade that has been built around the bronze.

255
00:33:30.160 --> 00:33:35.320
There is no longer reason to travel far to retrieve metal.

256
00:33:35.480 --> 00:33:39.800
When the iron takes over, a new epoch begins - the Iron Age.

257
00:33:52.040 --> 00:33:56.200
When you start to extract iron ore here and start using iron -

258
00:33:56.360 --> 00:34:00.720
- Then the entire Bronze Age's social order breaks together.

259
00:34:00.880 --> 00:34:06.600
You no longer become dependent on long -distance trading with copper and tin.

260
00:34:06.760 --> 00:34:09.880
You can extract this yourself in the marshes.

261
00:34:10.960 --> 00:34:14.760
It means that all this brilliance -

262
00:34:14.920 --> 00:34:21.240
- With bronze and gold and international trade, disappears.

263
00:34:21.400 --> 00:34:28.560
All the big and fine houses and trading venues also disappear - also disappear -

264
00:34:28.720 --> 00:34:34.600
- But for the common man it may be a better society.

265
00:34:34.760 --> 00:34:42.160
Because it will be a less hierarchical society, at least for a while.

266
00:34:42.320 --> 00:34:46.360
For a few hundred years we have a more democratic society.

267
00:34:48.640 --> 00:34:53.480
The iron means a technical revolution.
 You get more efficient tools -

268
00:34:53.640 --> 00:34:59.360
- Both for agriculture and cooking, and not least when it comes to weapons.

269
00:35:03.080 --> 00:35:07.320
During the Iron Age, something big also happens down on the continent.

270
00:35:07.480 --> 00:35:11.160
The Roman Empire is growing and becomes an empire.

271
00:35:15.120 --> 00:35:21.400
During the Iron Age, we clearly see that Roman influence is growing.

272
00:35:21.560 --> 00:35:27.200
We have always been traveling, but when the Roman Empire is established in Europe -

273
00:35:27.360 --> 00:35:32.640
- Then the focus on travel becomes more focused on the Roman Empire.

274
00:35:32.800 --> 00:35:37.560
The Roman Empire has been well known to virtually everyone in Scandinavia.

275
00:35:39.920 --> 00:35:44.600
The Roman Empire is most powerful in the early 100's AD.

276
00:35:44.760 --> 00:35:47.960
But it is at war with different people groups -

277
00:35:48.120 --> 00:35:52.040
- And need strengthening of mercenaries from the Nordic countries as well.

278
00:35:52.200 --> 00:35:56.560
In the early 400s, the Roman Empire is weakened by war-

279
00:35:56.720 --> 00:36:00.160
- And new people groups that enter Europe from the east.

280
00:36:02.800 --> 00:36:07.360
This is a time of upheaval - the migration period.

281
00:36:51.160 --> 00:36:56.240
A way to make quick money and experience adventures for young men in the north -

282
00:36:56.400 --> 00:36:59.760
- Is taking recruitment in the Roman army.

283
00:37:25.400 --> 00:37:28.800
Probably the second and third sons are traveling.

284
00:37:28.960 --> 00:37:33.840
The eldest son inherits the farm and the ground, but the others also need livelihoods.

285
00:37:34.000 --> 00:37:40.880
Then you travel by boats along the coast and then take the rivers through Europe.

286
00:38:05.800 --> 00:38:12.160
Many Norwegians came to the continent to serve in the Roman army.

287
00:38:43.000 --> 00:38:47.480
In the Roman army, the Scandinavian warriors - learned

288
00:38:47.640 --> 00:38:52.120
- To fight in a certain way and organize the armies in a specific way.

289
00:39:07.600 --> 00:39:11.040
It took it with you back to Scandinavia -

290
00:39:11.200 --> 00:39:15.480
- And used the same tactics in the internal war they had here.

291
00:39:27.360 --> 00:39:33.800
It is a machogrej to make this trip, be warriors far away -

292
00:39:33.960 --> 00:39:38.440
- Take with gold and valuables home, and to survive this trip.

293
00:39:38.600 --> 00:39:42.560
It gives a high status once you come back.

294
00:39:49.160 --> 00:39:52.960
One that seems very interested in status is this storman -

295
00:39:53.120 --> 00:39:56.840
-which lives near little Jored in the 300s.

296
00:39:58.160 --> 00:40:01.520
He has probably fought for the Romans and returned home.

297
00:40:01.680 --> 00:40:05.160
In his grave you will find beautiful jewelry in gold -

298
00:40:05.320 --> 00:40:09.280
- And a medallion with his Roman Portrait.

299
00:40:11.120 --> 00:40:15.680
Roman gold coins are the role model, but made in Scandinavia.

300
00:40:15.840 --> 00:40:22.400
At it you see the buried man depicted as the Roman emperor.

301
00:40:22.560 --> 00:40:28.280
He has used the same sign of his power as the Roman emperor.

302
00:40:28.440 --> 00:40:32.240
He probably wants to impress his surroundings with the medallion.

303
00:40:32.400 --> 00:40:35.840
He adds details to make it look Roman.

304
00:40:36.000 --> 00:40:38.320
But there is something that is not right.

305
00:40:38.480 --> 00:40:42.200
Everything is not exactly like the Roman models.

306
00:40:42.360 --> 00:40:47.720
Around your face you see something that looks like letters.

307
00:40:47.880 --> 00:40:54.040
There are fake letters.
 You have tried to imitate something you did not understand.

308
00:40:55.200 --> 00:41:00.960
Thus, misunderstood Roman signs, because Latin has not been understood.

309
00:41:23.200 --> 00:41:26.520
But there were those who understood the Roman alphabet.

310
00:41:26.680 --> 00:41:31.960
They used it as inspiration for our first alphabet - the runes.

311
00:41:36.120 --> 00:41:42.800
There is an alphabet from the 400s or 500s on the Kylve run stone.

312
00:41:42.960 --> 00:41:48.000
One of the oldest runa alphabets that is preserved complete.

313
00:41:49.920 --> 00:41:53.280
The runes are taken from the Roman written language -

314
00:41:53.440 --> 00:41:56.640
- But they are adapted to Nordic contexts.

315
00:41:56.800 --> 00:42:01.640
Among other things, the runes get their own names associated with Nordic gods.

316
00:42:01.800 --> 00:42:05.440
The Roman Empire affects us very much up here -

317
00:42:05.600 --> 00:42:08.760
- With objects, ideas and knowledge.

318
00:42:24.040 --> 00:42:29.120
For example, you learn advanced operations by Roman field doctors.

319
00:42:29.280 --> 00:42:32.800
It is knowledge that you bring home.

320
00:42:39.000 --> 00:42:43.760
In Sweden, surgical instruments - have been found in various places - have been found

321
00:42:43.920 --> 00:42:47.040
- As scalpels, probes and the like.

322
00:42:47.200 --> 00:42:52.720
A tool has even been found to operate a star.

323
00:42:52.880 --> 00:42:57.640
Something the Roman doctors can also be three -pan.

324
00:42:57.800 --> 00:43:03.320
An operation that involves cutting, drilling or scraping holes in the main bowl -

325
00:43:03.480 --> 00:43:07.480
- To relieve the pressure against the brain from an internal bleeding.

326
00:43:08.960 --> 00:43:14.720
Trevaning is probably something that Northern residents in the Roman army came into contact with.

327
00:43:17.960 --> 00:43:21.600
The operations were done completely without anesthetic.

328
00:43:21.760 --> 00:43:27.200
We must imagine that they have been extremely painful and unpleasant.

329
00:43:30.720 --> 00:43:34.080
Trevanation was also carried out in Sweden.

330
00:43:36.200 --> 00:43:40.120
This skull belongs to a woman who died about the year 100–

331
00:43:40.280 --> 00:43:43.400
- And was buried at the Smörkullen in Östergötland.

332
00:43:44.960 --> 00:43:49.240
The hole here did not cause her death.

333
00:43:49.400 --> 00:43:52.640
On the contrary, it was probably what saved her.

334
00:43:52.800 --> 00:43:56.680
Maybe she had suffered from an internal bleeding in her head.

335
00:43:56.840 --> 00:44:01.880
A serious condition leading to death unless the pressure is eased.

336
00:44:04.120 --> 00:44:08.520
Someone tried to save her life, and succeeded.

337
00:44:09.920 --> 00:44:15.680
This woman has survived a three -pan, and lived long afterwards.

338
00:44:15.840 --> 00:44:21.080
If you look around the hole you can see that the bone tissue has grown.

339
00:44:21.240 --> 00:44:24.880
This means that she has lived long after the procedure.

340
00:44:25.040 --> 00:44:28.880
When conducting the excavation of the burial ground -

341
00:44:29.040 --> 00:44:33.160
- If you find more people who have undergone the same intervention.

342
00:44:33.320 --> 00:44:37.640
All of them seem to have lived for several years after the three -pan.

343
00:44:44.720 --> 00:44:50.000
The everyday life of the Iron Age man is also affected by the Roman Empire.

344
00:44:52.240 --> 00:44:56.440
For example, the Romans teach us the art of baking bread.

345
00:44:57.640 --> 00:45:01.040
And many glass objects are imported from the Roman Empire -

346
00:45:01.200 --> 00:45:05.440
- Together with other luxury items that provide status and prestige.

347
00:45:07.400 --> 00:45:10.720
These are almost two thousand years old.

348
00:45:26.000 --> 00:45:29.520
This time is also known as the Nordic Golden Age -

349
00:45:29.680 --> 00:45:32.600
- Because of all the gold items found.

350
00:45:32.760 --> 00:45:37.360
Jewelry made by the gold coins that the soldiers take home.

351
00:45:51.080 --> 00:45:55.400
Perhaps the most beautiful examples of it are three gold neck collars.

352
00:46:05.000 --> 00:46:11.320
The absolute masterpieces regarding goldsmith are the three gold neck collars.

353
00:46:11.480 --> 00:46:15.120
One is found in Öland and two in Västergötland.

354
00:46:16.560 --> 00:46:22.280
They show a golden age in terms of craftsmanship in the Nordic countries.

355
00:46:40.880 --> 00:46:45.320
But at the end of the 400s, the West Roman Empire falls.

356
00:46:46.560 --> 00:46:51.320
The North residents who have served in the Västromerska army are now getting rid of their jobs.

357
00:47:04.040 --> 00:47:09.920
It will have consequences here at home in Scandinavia, not least in Öland.

358
00:47:48.400 --> 00:47:53.560
The gold flow ends.
 There are no more valuables to Öland.

359
00:47:53.720 --> 00:47:59.160
Networks you have had in Europe collapses, you no longer travel.

360
00:47:59.320 --> 00:48:05.920
This leads to problems on a completely populated island. There is no new land.

361
00:48:06.080 --> 00:48:12.720
It will be a power vacuum where you need to build a new power structure.

362
00:48:15.800 --> 00:48:19.320
Who is going to have power on the island?

363
00:48:19.480 --> 00:48:24.000
This probably leads to a civil war, simply.

364
00:48:24.160 --> 00:48:26.520
Who will be the strongest chief?

365
00:48:28.800 --> 00:48:34.280
It is night in the late 400s when the conflict reaches its peak.

366
00:48:34.440 --> 00:48:39.720
Behind the four meters high walls of Sandby Borg on eastern Öland-

367
00:48:39.880 --> 00:48:42.880
- Leaves the village residents and sleeps.

368
00:48:51.880 --> 00:48:55.800
It is believed that the chiefs had a party during the evening.

369
00:48:58.120 --> 00:49:03.520
Probably several local tribal leaders have gathered to negotiate.

370
00:49:08.440 --> 00:49:11.800
But now everyone is sleeping in Sandby Borg.

371
00:49:39.320 --> 00:49:44.440
Now you are starting to understand what happened that night 1,600 years ago.

372
00:49:44.600 --> 00:49:50.080
The excavations in Sandby Borg's ruin led to five jewelry hides -

373
00:49:50.240 --> 00:49:54.920
—A which included gilded costume and glass beads -

374
00:49:55.080 --> 00:49:58.560
- With origin in the Roman Mediterranean.

375
00:50:04.560 --> 00:50:09.640
They also find a Roman gold coin from the mid-400s.

376
00:50:09.800 --> 00:50:15.880
It strengthens the theory that several people here had worked in the Roman army.

377
00:50:21.040 --> 00:50:28.600
But in addition to this, the archaeologists also made other, more macabre finds.

378
00:50:38.840 --> 00:50:42.400
When the bodies arrived and we began to understand what it was -

379
00:50:42.560 --> 00:50:46.680
- Then was my first feeling: "Exciting!"
 And then: "What a terrible!"

380
00:50:49.160 --> 00:50:55.120
A balance between archaeologically interesting and emotionally difficult.

381
00:50:55.280 --> 00:51:00.480
These are real people, they have been treated terribly.

382
00:51:00.640 --> 00:51:04.240
And you have that feeling with you all the time.

383
00:51:08.920 --> 00:51:15.360
It was probably 200-300 who lived there, in terms of the size of the castle.

384
00:51:23.040 --> 00:51:28.960
There are both injuries from swords and from blunt violence on the bodies.

385
00:51:38.240 --> 00:51:41.600
There are not so many defense injuries.

386
00:51:41.760 --> 00:51:45.600
It is more that you have been attacked.

387
00:51:45.760 --> 00:51:51.080
They have not been prepared, but have tried to escape or surprised.

388
00:51:55.960 --> 00:51:58.960
Surprise attacks we think it's all about.

389
00:52:54.040 --> 00:52:59.800
Everything is over in a few hours.
 Screams and horror changed in cold silence.

390
00:52:59.960 --> 00:53:04.960
In houses after houses, the attackers have killed the inhabitants.

391
00:53:07.400 --> 00:53:10.160
There are only the dead bodies.

392
00:53:16.080 --> 00:53:20.440
Leaving all the dead remains is a way to humiliate them-

393
00:53:20.600 --> 00:53:24.360
- And prevent them from moving on in the next life.

394
00:53:24.520 --> 00:53:29.200
They do not get the rituals and the funeral they would normally get -

395
00:53:29.360 --> 00:53:33.280
- So the dead will travel to the next page.

396
00:53:33.440 --> 00:53:37.000
It is a humiliation that extends into death.

397
00:53:42.120 --> 00:53:46.440
A mystery in Sandby Borg is that there are dead women.

398
00:53:47.960 --> 00:53:53.960
Jewelry, looms, children have been found, so there should be women.

399
00:53:54.120 --> 00:53:58.240
But so far, the skeleton has only been found after a single woman.

400
00:54:00.800 --> 00:54:03.920
We think they may have gathered the women.

401
00:54:04.080 --> 00:54:09.800
Maybe they have brought a couple of pieces, but not everyone who lived there.

402
00:54:11.000 --> 00:54:15.000
Somewhere in the castle they lie, gathered together probably.

403
00:54:16.280 --> 00:54:18.840
These seven precious costume buckles -

404
00:54:19.000 --> 00:54:24.920
- I suggest that as many chief women were in the bail during the attack.

405
00:54:25.080 --> 00:54:29.960
The archaeologists believe that the local chiefs were gathered there -

406
00:54:30.120 --> 00:54:34.840
- And that enemies from another area were behind the massacre.

407
00:54:35.000 --> 00:54:40.920
They struck in the middle of the night to knock out the overall resistance.

408
00:54:45.280 --> 00:54:49.160
While life in other island castles continued as before-

409
00:54:49.320 --> 00:54:53.840
- So Sandby Borg was transformed into a spooky place.

410
00:54:54.000 --> 00:54:57.800
A place that the islanders avoided for generations.

411
00:54:57.960 --> 00:55:02.520
What makes the place so special is that it is a frozen moment.

412
00:55:02.680 --> 00:55:06.160
All the dead remain as they fell.

413
00:55:06.320 --> 00:55:09.080
Everyone is in the middle of their everyday life -

414
00:55:09.240 --> 00:55:13.360
- With furniture, food and what the houses have looked like.

415
00:55:13.520 --> 00:55:18.840
We almost never see that archaeologically - usually houses are ejected -

416
00:55:19.000 --> 00:55:23.600
- They have burned, you have moved.
 Here everything remains.

417
00:55:23.760 --> 00:55:28.680
In one of the houses, next to the fireplace, the skeleton lay of half a herring.

418
00:55:28.840 --> 00:55:32.840
They may have sat and eaten just before this happened.

419
00:55:33.000 --> 00:55:38.600
It is such an incredible snapshot that you have a hard time understanding it.

420
00:55:51.680 --> 00:55:58.400
The massacre in Sandby Borg shows the chaos during the migration period.

421
00:55:58.560 --> 00:56:02.200
Soon life in the Nordic countries will be thrown even more.

422
00:56:03.400 --> 00:56:05.840
A disaster is on the way.

423
00:56:06.000 --> 00:56:11.560
A disaster that will eradicate close to half of Sweden's population.

424
00:56:11.720 --> 00:56:15.320
But from the ashes, a new era should arise.

425
00:56:15.480 --> 00:56:18.200
Viking Age.

426
00:56:18.360 --> 00:56:20.920
Farmers leave at sea-

427
00:56:21.080 --> 00:56:25.240
–And is known in Europe and further away than that.

428
00:56:38.280 --> 00:56:42.280
But over time, a new religion will take root here.

429
00:56:42.440 --> 00:56:46.440
A religion that challenges the Vikings' way of life.

430
00:56:50.760 --> 00:56:53.760
