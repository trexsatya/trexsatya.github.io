1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,320
Today we will meet Sweden's ten best lookalikes.

2
00:00:03,920 --> 00:00:06,720
Greta Thunberg's secret double -hit in Helsingborg.

3
00:00:06,920 --> 00:00:11,000
Leif and Billy's copies that also take over the stage and deceive the audience.

4
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:14,240
And then I finally get to meet my own mirror image.

5
00:00:14,680 --> 00:00:19,400
But we start with number ten that we find in Bagarmossen outside Stockholm.

6
00:00:19,400 --> 00:00:26,120
Because here it is said that there is a shoemaker who should be ridiculously similar to Robert De Niro.

7
00:00:26,120 --> 00:00:27,480
And he will try to find now.

8
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:31,640
Just that, I forgot to say, this section is in paid collaboration with Revolut.

9
00:00:31,640 --> 00:00:33,000
- May I ask you something?

10
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,600
- We are looking for Bagarmossens Robert De Niro.

11
00:00:38,600 --> 00:00:39,560
A shoemaker.

12
00:00:39,560 --> 00:00:40,840
- Yes, it's the farthest away.

13
00:00:40,840 --> 00:00:41,560
- Yes.

14
00:00:43,560 --> 00:00:44,520
- Have a lovely day!

15
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:46,520
Hello Hello!

16
00:00:46,520 --> 00:00:49,240
- He is very wonderful.
 He is actually like Robert De Niro.

17
00:00:49,240 --> 00:00:49,880
- Is he?

18
00:00:49,880 --> 00:00:50,840
- Fixes everything.

19
00:00:50,840 --> 00:00:51,800
- A top guy?

20
00:00:51,800 --> 00:00:54,360
- Yes.
 Listen what a nice thing it was now when you cut yourself.

21
00:00:54,360 --> 00:00:56,360
Was on time.

22
00:00:56,360 --> 00:00:58,360
Sorry!

23
00:00:58,360 --> 00:01:00,360
- huh?

24
00:01:00,360 --> 00:01:04,360
Now we are starting to approach shoe and key service.

25
00:01:04,360 --> 00:01:06,360
I think he is.

26
00:01:06,360 --> 00:01:10,360
Oh!
 It says on the sign.

27
00:01:10,360 --> 00:01:13,360
Bagarmossen's own De Niro fixes everything.

28
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:14,360
Hello!

29
00:01:14,360 --> 00:01:18,360
There we have him!
 Bagarmossens Robert De Niro.

30
00:01:21,499 --> 00:01:23,022
- Hey!

31
00:01:23,022 --> 00:01:25,266
It's Robert De Niro in Bagarmossen's shoemaking here.

32
00:01:26,283 --> 00:01:28,283
You Talking to Me?

33
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:33,360
- Gabriel De Niro.

34
00:01:34,905 --> 00:01:36,166
You Talking to Me?

35
00:01:36,166 --> 00:01:38,050
- Yes I am Talking to you.

36
00:01:38,050 --> 00:01:40,050
- Welcome to my country!

37
00:01:40,457 --> 00:01:42,457
- Do you think talk to me?

38
00:01:42,457 --> 00:01:44,272
But it must be with a gun.

39
00:01:44,272 --> 00:01:45,866
You have a gun or?

40
00:01:45,877 --> 00:01:47,360
- We have no gun.

41
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:49,065
- What should I do without a gun?
 It doesn't get tough.

42
00:01:50,838 --> 00:01:53,360
- The sick thing is that you sound like De Niro as well.

43
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:55,360
Can you speak English once?

44
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:57,360
- Just a little, what you want.
 Ask me.

45
00:01:57,360 --> 00:02:02,360
- It's still Lebanese Robert De Niro.
 You hear that anyway.

46
00:02:02,360 --> 00:02:04,360
- So, now it's done.

47
00:02:04,360 --> 00:02:06,360
- Is it clear already?

48
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:08,360
- So.

49
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:12,360
- It took like 27 seconds.

50
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:14,360
- 27 seconds.

51
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:15,640
- You are a genius.

52
00:02:15,640 --> 00:02:16,960
- Thanks so much.

53
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:18,960
- I appreciate the one you told me Geni.

54
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:23,280
- It's like I'm with Robert De Niro.

55
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:24,280
- That's true, yes.

56
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:27,280
You are filming me.

57
00:02:27,880 --> 00:02:28,440
- Yes he does.

58
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:29,840
- Yes that is good.

59
00:02:40,040 --> 00:02:43,240
- The funny thing is that you are extremely similar to De Niro.

60
00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:47,840
But my photographer is also very good at being like Deniro.

61
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:50,440
- If we just sound ... Gabbe, if you hold this for a while.

62
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:52,040
- Are you talk to me?

63
00:02:52,040 --> 00:02:53,040
- Aha, yeah, yeah.

64
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:53,840
- Talking to me?

65
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:55,040
- No, you're talking to me.

66
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:56,240
- No, you're talking to me.

67
00:02:56,240 --> 00:02:57,040
- No, you're talking to me.

68
00:02:57,040 --> 00:02:58,040
- No, you're talking to me.

69
00:02:58,040 --> 00:02:59,040
- No, you're talking to me.

70
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:00,040
- No, you're talking to day.

71
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:03,040
- I don't know, this here, only this here.

72
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:04,240
- Thank you so much for meeting you.

73
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:07,840
- Thank you and also fun to see you.

74
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:09,840
It's a little, you're just a little long.

75
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:13,040
It gets hurt in my neck when I look at you all the time.

76
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:16,680
It was a little difficult.
 It is better that you play basketball.

77
00:03:21,720 --> 00:03:27,080
In doing so, we leave the shoemaker in the bagamoss and take us up a level to Istan's number nine.

78
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:31,240
- The next guest we will call.
 Now it will be about Piteås ...

79
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:33,600
Erling Haaland.

80
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:36,800
Hello.

81
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:42,120
- Will people come forward and tell you that you are like him?

82
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:48,440
- I play football and every team we meet just says, here we have Haaland Junior.

83
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:54,160
- It's something when you smile and have the camera a little underneath and look up.

84
00:03:54,320 --> 00:04:00,240
And smile with the teeth open.
 So.
 And then you look up.

85
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:02,760
Smile more.

86
00:04:02,920 --> 00:04:08,120
Fuck, now we cod the drawing.
 Now we are stuck on a Frame.

87
00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:12,960
We put a point there and move up the list instead.

88
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:16,560
You will soon be able to meet Anders Bagge's unknown looko-

89
00:04:16,640 --> 00:04:19,200
-And Sweden's Leonardo DiCaprio.

90
00:04:19,280 --> 00:04:22,000
But we start with the number eight of the list.

91
00:04:22,080 --> 00:04:23,680
- Now we have traveled south.

92
00:04:23,760 --> 00:04:29,240
Because here, right up there, still lives something so unexpected and luxurious-

93
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:33,440
-It feels like Helsingborgs Greta Thunberg.

94
00:04:37,080 --> 00:04:39,080
Hello!

95
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:45,680
In paid collaboration with Revolut, I will send 10,000 to my photographer.

96
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:48,480
He has 60 seconds to spend.

97
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:51,840
Ready?
 Drive!

98
00:04:56,019 --> 00:04:59,724

00:05:32,540 --> 00:05:34,640

00:05:34,640 --> 00:05:36,640
Ay Caramba!

108
00:05:36,640 --> 00:05:37,840
Carajo!

112
00:05:52,860 --> 00:05:56,300
There was time out.

114
00:06:02,660 --> 00:06:03,980
- Where is that link?

115
00:06:04,380 --> 00:06:07,020
- It is in the description.
 The link is in the description.

116
00:06:07,100 --> 00:06:08,660
Thanks, revolut.

117
00:06:11,980 --> 00:06:15,020
- Hello!

118
00:06:18,380 --> 00:06:22,460
- Here we have Emmys who in 2019 went viral with this clip.

119
00:06:22,620 --> 00:06:27,860
Which got half the world to believe that Greta Thunberg was lying on a shooting range.

120
00:06:28,020 --> 00:06:30,580
- How many saw that video?

121
00:06:30,740 --> 00:06:34,660
- Any number.
 I don't know how many millions of views it has.

122
00:06:34,660 --> 00:06:40,620
It was first spread in Brazil, then it got well attached to the rest of the world in the area against people woke up that day.

123
00:06:40,620 --> 00:06:43,580
- So it was like millions in one day?

124
00:06:43,580 --> 00:06:44,300
- Yes.

125
00:06:44,300 --> 00:06:47,340
- But how similar are you Greta as a person?

126
00:06:47,340 --> 00:06:52,020
- So I like to play computer games, ride a motorcycle.

127
00:06:52,020 --> 00:06:53,580
- What do you play for computer games?

128
00:06:53,580 --> 00:06:55,420
- Oh, don't judge me.

129
00:06:55,420 --> 00:06:56,020
- So?

130
00:06:56,020 --> 00:06:59,540
- No, I play Russian fishing simulator games.

131
00:06:59,540 --> 00:07:01,380
- Now it's on g. Oh damn, he was heavy you.

132
00:07:01,380 --> 00:07:01,900
- Be he?

133
00:07:01,900 --> 00:07:02,900
- Yes.

134
00:07:02,900 --> 00:07:04,900
- I have five meters left.

135
00:07:04,900 --> 00:07:07,900
Oh oh oh!
 A cod!

136
00:07:07,900 --> 00:07:08,900
YES!

137
00:07:08,900 --> 00:07:10,900
- We got a cod.

138
00:07:10,900 --> 00:07:15,900
- I would probably say that our interests probably differ.

139
00:07:15,900 --> 00:07:19,900
I don't know what she does about the days, but I like firearms.

140
00:07:19,900 --> 00:07:20,900
- Pang, pang?

141
00:07:20,900 --> 00:07:23,140
- Yes Pang Pang.
 The best there is.

142
00:07:40,180 --> 00:07:42,860
- Jesus!
 Fuck!

143
00:07:45,460 --> 00:07:47,860
- Oh, shit!
 –Up, up, up!

144
00:07:48,020 --> 00:07:50,620
- Oh oh oh!

145
00:07:50,620 --> 00:07:55,180
- God, now comes security personnel.
 I can't be there anymore.

146
00:07:55,340 --> 00:07:57,340
Oh!
 Sorry.

147
00:07:59,500 --> 00:08:02,860
- This you shot just recently.
 Now we're going to shoot this one.

148
00:08:03,020 --> 00:08:05,420
It will slap much higher.

149
00:08:05,580 --> 00:08:07,740
–And it makes you happy?
 -Yes.

150
00:08:07,900 --> 00:08:11,940
- How rough is this weapon?
 --Otrously rough.

151
00:08:12,100 --> 00:08:14,980
- Do you even decorate?
 - Yes, I'm starting to get adrenaline.

152
00:08:14,980 --> 00:08:17,540
- What the hell am I going to do then?
 I'm going home.

153
00:08:17,540 --> 00:08:18,540
- Yes, it will go well.

154
00:08:31,460 --> 00:08:32,740
- Fucking Hell!

155
00:08:32,740 --> 00:08:34,220
- What the fuck?

156
00:08:38,220 --> 00:08:39,420
Are you kidding me?

157
00:08:40,140 --> 00:08:41,620
- Oh my God!

158
00:08:41,620 --> 00:08:43,620
- You have to test this.

159
00:08:43,620 --> 00:08:46,620
- No no no no.
 Now we thank you.

160
00:08:46,620 --> 00:08:49,620
My God, what a bang.

161
00:08:51,620 --> 00:08:54,620
- Are you a climate person who is very much based on the climate?

162
00:08:54,620 --> 00:08:58,620
- No, I see it more like I was a vegetarian and vegan for seven years.

163
00:08:58,620 --> 00:09:00,620
- What do you want?

164
00:09:00,620 --> 00:09:02,620
- I would like a kebab in bread.

165
00:09:02,620 --> 00:09:03,620
Extra meat.

166
00:09:07,620 --> 00:09:10,620
- She has met Angela Merkel, Trump.

167
00:09:10,620 --> 00:09:12,620
You feel like you're not impressed at all.

168
00:09:12,620 --> 00:09:14,620
- Well actually.

169
00:09:14,620 --> 00:09:16,620
I am very happy.

170
00:09:16,620 --> 00:09:18,620
- Is it going well?

171
00:09:18,620 --> 00:09:20,620
- It's fine.
 But he is not so impressed.

172
00:09:20,620 --> 00:09:22,620
What do you think about the climate and stuff?

173
00:09:22,620 --> 00:09:25,620
- The climate here, it's very cold.

174
00:09:25,620 --> 00:09:27,620
- Right.

175
00:09:27,620 --> 00:09:29,620
- We come from Turkey, you know.

176
00:09:29,620 --> 00:09:31,620
- It's warmer there.

177
00:09:31,620 --> 00:09:34,620
- But we are happy here.
 The people are hot.

178
00:09:34,620 --> 00:09:36,620
- The people are hot, yes.

179
00:09:36,620 --> 00:09:38,620
So you're positive about the climate?

180
00:09:38,620 --> 00:09:40,620
- We are happy for them.

181
00:09:42,340 --> 00:09:43,860
Then the food was finished.

182
00:09:43,860 --> 00:09:48,620
And then one of the pizza bays wanted to take a picture with what he thought was Greta Thunberg.

183
00:09:48,620 --> 00:09:50,620
- Yes, do you know what?
 I got a bad conscience now.

184
00:09:51,620 --> 00:09:54,340
This, so she is just like Greta.

185
00:09:55,580 --> 00:09:57,580
It's not Greta.

186
00:09:58,060 --> 00:10:00,060
It's not she.
 In other words...

187
00:10:00,260 --> 00:10:02,260
It's not Greta.

188
00:10:02,620 --> 00:10:04,940
Unfortunately.
 I got such a bad conscience now.

189
00:10:04,940 --> 00:10:08,700
She's just ... No, she's just as Greta.
 It's not Greta.

190
00:10:08,700 --> 00:10:10,380
- He's a big troll, but ...

191
00:10:10,380 --> 00:10:13,380
- He's a big troll?
 No, I'm not a magician.

192
00:10:13,380 --> 00:10:16,580
- No, I'm not troll.
 It's not joking.

193
00:10:16,580 --> 00:10:21,900
- No, it's not Greta.
 That's true, it's not Greta.
 Or, you can take a picture.

194
00:10:21,900 --> 00:10:23,420
- Yes.

195
00:10:23,420 --> 00:10:27,420
So confused!
 He thinks I'm kidding now.

196
00:10:27,420 --> 00:10:30,700
Yes, okay, I've been kidding.
 Run, take a picture.

197
00:10:30,700 --> 00:10:33,500
I just want to say it's not Greta.

198
00:10:33,500 --> 00:10:34,500
- Okay.

199
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:36,500
- You don't believe me!

200
00:10:38,500 --> 00:10:40,500
- Drink like this imperialist soda and eat meat.

201
00:10:40,500 --> 00:10:41,500
- God so tasty!

202
00:10:41,500 --> 00:10:42,500
- Yes.

203
00:10:42,500 --> 00:10:46,500
- Check out how she just chops in on the meat.

204
00:10:46,500 --> 00:10:49,500
You like NATO sliding weapons and meat.

205
00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:51,500
It's like ...

206
00:10:51,500 --> 00:10:53,500
- Yes, but it was well summarized.

207
00:10:53,500 --> 00:10:55,500
It's like what you need to know about me.

208
00:10:55,500 --> 00:10:59,500
- But how similar is Emmy really Greta appearance?

209
00:10:59,500 --> 00:11:02,500
To test it I wanted to see if we could create a viral cliff-

210
00:11:02,500 --> 00:11:05,540
-It pretended that Greta has started sniffing loose.

211
00:11:05,700 --> 00:11:10,260
A strange yet credible news that could act as a test.

212
00:11:10,420 --> 00:11:12,740
Will people see the difference between them?

213
00:11:12,900 --> 00:11:16,300
- You have to change.
 I have to buy loose nus.

214
00:11:16,460 --> 00:11:17,700
- Yes.

215
00:11:17,860 --> 00:11:22,020
- This is a real fur.
 You absolutely cannot wear it.

216
00:11:22,180 --> 00:11:27,660
A small scarf, just because that effect is so extreme.

217
00:11:27,820 --> 00:11:30,620
So I pull and buy some loose snuff.

218
00:11:30,620 --> 00:11:31,620
Let's go.

219
00:11:31,820 --> 00:11:32,820
Now we are going in the same direction.

220
00:11:32,820 --> 00:11:33,320
Fuck.

221
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:39,120
- It's so ridiculously the same.

222
00:11:39,420 --> 00:11:43,120
Excuse.
 You couldn't imagine being a statistician in a scene.

223
00:11:44,620 --> 00:11:48,120
You can give some credibility to the stage that we are creating.

224
00:11:48,120 --> 00:11:49,320
Are everyone ready?

225
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:49,820
- Yes.

226
00:11:49,820 --> 00:11:50,820
- Are you ready?

227
00:11:50,820 --> 00:11:53,820
1, 2, 3.

228
00:12:00,820 --> 00:12:04,820
That is still Greta.
 Can you see the similarity?

229
00:12:04,820 --> 00:12:06,820
- It actually got really good.

230
00:12:06,820 --> 00:12:09,820
- I have a friend who has a big MEME account on Instagram.

231
00:12:09,820 --> 00:12:11,820
Which is very much about snuff and stuff.

232
00:12:11,820 --> 00:12:15,820
If he posts it, we simply see what happens.

233
00:12:18,820 --> 00:12:21,340
Hi beaver.
 I just sent you the clip.

234
00:12:27,840 --> 00:12:28,460
- Run it out!

235
00:12:28,460 --> 00:12:29,660
So we'll see what happens.

236
00:12:29,860 --> 00:12:33,460
Now it is just letting time go and we see where this clip is going.

237
00:12:34,340 --> 00:12:37,819
The vast majority seemed to be happy about the unexpected news.

238
00:12:37,819 --> 00:12:41,740
Only a few bores questioned whether it was really real Greta.

239
00:12:42,180 --> 00:12:47,540
The clip spread on Twitter and Tiktok and only on Instagram it got over two million views.

240
00:12:47,540 --> 00:12:52,680
Most of whom now seem to think that Greta Thunberg has started with Lösnus.

241
00:12:53,340 --> 00:12:55,420
However, we are going to number seven.

242
00:12:55,900 --> 00:12:59,580
- And now it will be about my own lookalike.

243
00:12:59,860 --> 00:13:04,220
In recent years, we have received hundreds of tips on people who should be like me.

244
00:13:04,420 --> 00:13:05,940
No one is really similar.

245
00:13:06,220 --> 00:13:13,528
Now we have a guy who really hopes will be the closest we have of me in Sweden.

246
00:13:14,020 --> 00:13:15,340
So now it's up to proof.

247
00:13:15,340 --> 00:13:17,340
There he is!

248
00:13:17,340 --> 00:13:19,340
Yes, that's him!

249
00:13:19,340 --> 00:13:21,340
Come out!

250
00:13:21,340 --> 00:13:23,340
Hello!

251
00:13:23,340 --> 00:13:25,340
Hello!
 My name is Mustiga Mauri.

252
00:13:25,340 --> 00:13:27,340
I am 17 years old, I go to high school-

253
00:13:27,340 --> 00:13:29,340
-and I'm 175 cm tall.

254
00:13:29,340 --> 00:13:31,340
- Hello

255
00:13:31,340 --> 00:13:33,340
- How's it going?

256
00:13:33,340 --> 00:13:35,340
- It is good!

257
00:13:35,340 --> 00:13:37,080
Do you imitate me?

258
00:13:37,080 --> 00:13:38,189
- I'm like this.

259
00:13:38,189 --> 00:13:39,340
- Is it true?

260
00:13:39,340 --> 00:13:43,340
It's a bit the same energy on you.

261
00:13:43,340 --> 00:13:46,420
But this was still a little better than I thought.

262
00:13:46,420 --> 00:13:47,660
- It's so, yes.

263
00:13:47,660 --> 00:13:49,860
You should know how many people say I'm like Mauri.

264
00:13:49,860 --> 00:13:51,860
- Does it happen that people think you are Mauri?

265
00:13:51,860 --> 00:13:53,500
- On Odenplan, I went.

266
00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:55,100
And then a little guy comes up.

267
00:13:55,100 --> 00:13:56,500
So five, eight years or something.

268
00:13:56,500 --> 00:13:59,060
He came after me and said, apologize, can I take a picture?

269
00:13:59,060 --> 00:13:59,900
- No?

270
00:13:59,900 --> 00:14:02,420
And I just, eeh, and then just, no wait it is not you.

271
00:14:02,420 --> 00:14:03,260
And then he goes on.

272
00:14:03,260 --> 00:14:04,540
- If you had been two meters.

273
00:14:04,540 --> 00:14:05,180
- Yes then.

274
00:14:05,180 --> 00:14:06,900
- If we had just put you on stilts.

275
00:14:06,900 --> 00:14:08,180
- I can stand on that one.

276
00:14:08,180 --> 00:14:10,460
- Now, now, like that.

277
00:14:10,460 --> 00:14:11,580
- Now he's ready.

278
00:14:11,580 --> 00:14:15,240
So I have received so many people who say they are like me.

279
00:14:15,240 --> 00:14:17,240
Actually, it's just that they are red -haired.

280
00:14:17,240 --> 00:14:17,740
- Yes.

281
00:14:17,740 --> 00:14:20,540
But with you here there is something a little more.

282
00:14:20,540 --> 00:14:21,040
- Yes I know.

283
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:21,540
- It's something.

284
00:14:21,540 --> 00:14:22,040
- I know.

285
00:14:22,040 --> 00:14:23,540
- Shall we have a coffee?

286
00:14:23,540 --> 00:14:24,040
- Let's go.

287
00:14:24,040 --> 00:14:26,300
- How often does someone say you are like me?

288
00:14:26,300 --> 00:14:28,500
- Yes, it happens all the time.
 It is not possible to count.

289
00:14:28,500 --> 00:14:32,040
At school a few years ago, they didn't even know me.

290
00:14:32,040 --> 00:14:33,200
They just went and shouted.

291
00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:34,720
Mauri!
 Mauri!

292
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:36,340
Excuse me, can we take a picture with you, Mauri?

293
00:14:36,340 --> 00:14:36,840
- At school?

294
00:14:36,840 --> 00:14:38,100
At school?
 Damn!

295
00:14:38,100 --> 00:14:40,500
But what, how often have people wanted to take a picture with you?

296
00:14:40,500 --> 00:14:41,540
How many times has it happened?

297
00:14:41,540 --> 00:14:43,540
- Three, four times maybe.

298
00:14:43,540 --> 00:14:45,540
- Damn what anti -climax.

299
00:14:45,540 --> 00:14:47,540
- Cheers.

300
00:14:47,540 --> 00:14:49,540
- Cheers my mirror image.

301
00:14:49,540 --> 00:14:52,540
- I've been wondering if you are my secret cousin or dad or anything.

302
00:14:52,540 --> 00:14:54,540
No one in my family is Ginger.

303
00:14:54,540 --> 00:14:56,540
- What is your mother's name?

304
00:14:56,540 --> 00:14:58,540
- Beatrice.

305
00:14:58,540 --> 00:15:00,540
What did you do in 2005?

306
00:15:00,540 --> 00:15:02,540
Nah.

307
00:15:02,540 --> 00:15:04,540
Are you my dad?

308
00:15:04,540 --> 00:15:06,540
- Welcome.

309
00:15:06,540 --> 00:15:07,540
- Hello.

310
00:15:07,540 --> 00:15:09,540
Why did you go?

311
00:15:09,540 --> 00:15:11,540
We would just have some fun as well.

312
00:15:11,540 --> 00:15:13,540
- No no no.
 I am your father.

313
00:15:15,060 --> 00:15:21,180
And now we travel quickly to the number eight of the list where we find lookalike to Noel Fike from the band Hovet.

314
00:15:21,180 --> 00:15:25,460
And for the first time in world history, this visit will be made by a trainee.

315
00:15:25,460 --> 00:15:28,780
- Now we will meet Noel Flikes Lookalike.

316
00:15:28,780 --> 00:15:32,020
No, sorry.
 One more time!

317
00:15:32,900 --> 00:15:36,700
Hörrni, now we will meet Noel Flike's lookalike from Hovet.

318
00:15:36,700 --> 00:15:39,720
And he lives here.
 This is going to be fucking fun!

319
00:15:39,980 --> 00:15:41,480
Here we go!
 There he comes!

320
00:15:45,020 --> 00:15:45,520
Hello!

321
00:15:47,100 --> 00:15:48,460
Hi, yo, yo, yo!

322
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:53,360
My name is Noel Fike, I am 22 years old and live in Uppsala.

323
00:15:53,900 --> 00:15:57,680
I usually kick back mirrors on the way home.

324
00:16:01,520 --> 00:16:02,240
- New at work?

325
00:16:03,620 --> 00:16:04,640
- A little, a little.

326
00:16:04,640 --> 00:16:07,480
Do you have anything?
 I can try to come.
 On something too.

327
00:16:07,480 --> 00:16:09,480
But I do my best!

328
00:16:11,480 --> 00:16:12,760
You have nice eyes.

329
00:16:12,760 --> 00:16:14,760
- Do you think?
 The same.

330
00:16:14,760 --> 00:16:16,760
- Thanks.

331
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:21,560
- Talent!

332
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:26,760
- Your voice is almost identical.
 Can't you rap a little?

333
00:16:26,760 --> 00:16:28,760
- I'm just starting to rap a little.

334
00:16:28,760 --> 00:16:30,760
- Run some freestyle.

335
00:16:30,760 --> 00:16:32,480
- mm.

336
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:35,000
- My name is David and I live in Nacka.

337
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,200
I sit here with Mauri and we talk.

338
00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:41,720
We are very nice.
 Nice clothes, red -haired and ...

339
00:16:41,720 --> 00:16:47,160
- We sit in Nacka and talk.

340
00:16:47,160 --> 00:16:49,960
We are so nice.

341
00:16:49,960 --> 00:16:52,760
We drink some coffee.

342
00:16:52,760 --> 00:16:55,000
- Coffee, coffee.

343
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:56,600
Yes...

344
00:16:56,600 --> 00:16:58,200
No no no.

345
00:16:58,200 --> 00:17:01,360
No corner, this won't go.
 This won't go.
 I can not.

346
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:02,920
This is for ...

347
00:17:04,560 --> 00:17:06,960
- I may think we stop there.

348
00:17:06,960 --> 00:17:07,960
- Nice.

349
00:17:09,720 --> 00:17:10,440
- It was awesome.

350
00:17:10,440 --> 00:17:14,600
- It was the weakest segment on assignment food through before.

351
00:17:14,920 --> 00:17:20,560
- Before the next visit, I thought we would look at some of the tips you emailed but that did not join the clip.

352
00:17:20,800 --> 00:17:24,960
How about the girl who realized that as a child she was very similar to Ola Conny?

353
00:17:24,960 --> 00:17:28,080
Or this woman who is a huge Camilla Läckberg?

354
00:17:28,080 --> 00:17:33,000
And so this incredible GW locomotive bale which unfortunately was unable to record.

355
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,760
This woman is still like Carola.

356
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:41,120
And so this girl who is sick like in the middle of nature, the program manager, in a very exciting way.

357
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:47,000
And so my personal favorite, the guy who is not really really like Calle Morreus.

358
00:17:51,480 --> 00:17:55,000
And that was it, now time for the number five list.

359
00:17:55,000 --> 00:18:01,960
And now we will meet Enskedes Anders Bagge who apparently works down there.

360
00:18:02,760 --> 00:18:04,760
And this is where he should be.

361
00:18:06,040 --> 00:18:08,040
Hey!

362
00:18:08,840 --> 00:18:12,040
Hello!
 There we have him.

363
00:18:13,960 --> 00:18:19,160
Hi, my name is Anders Bagge.
 I have had a construction company here in Enskede for twelve years.

364
00:18:19,160 --> 00:18:22,200
And yes, I'm Anders Bagge.

365
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:25,520
- It's also the same beard.

366
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:27,840
- I've had it for 20 years.

367
00:18:27,920 --> 00:18:29,286
- Was it Bagge that turned off you?

368
00:18:29,286 --> 00:18:30,400
- I think so.

369
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:32,200
- That damn ...

370
00:18:32,280 --> 00:18:34,160
From profile here.

371
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:36,800
From here it is Anders Bagge.

372
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:40,920
Here it is ... it is still very much Anders Bagge.

373
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:42,200
How often do you hear that you ...

374
00:18:42,280 --> 00:18:45,120
- Very often.

375
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:46,400
- Is this snuff?

376
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:49,360
- I sniff a lot.

377
00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:52,940
- Now real Bagge will be a newspaper on me when I have such big boxes.

378
00:18:52,940 --> 00:18:54,940
- This is what you call a box too.

379
00:18:55,840 --> 00:18:57,840
That you have it in the back pocket.

380
00:18:58,680 --> 00:19:00,680
Yes, you think it's yummy, huh?

381
00:19:00,680 --> 00:19:02,680
- It is the best.

382
00:19:02,680 --> 00:19:04,680
Do you want a snuff?

383
00:19:07,380 --> 00:19:09,380
Now you have to try a real snuff.

384
00:19:10,380 --> 00:19:11,320
If you dare.

385
00:19:11,320 --> 00:19:12,320
Are you ready?

386
00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:13,120
- No.

387
00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:13,800
- Shall we drive?

388
00:19:13,800 --> 00:19:14,300
- Yes.

389
00:19:14,300 --> 00:19:16,300
- Okay, one, two, three.

390
00:19:21,020 --> 00:19:22,060
- Oh my God!

391
00:19:22,060 --> 00:19:24,060
- You have all your mouth.

392
00:19:24,860 --> 00:19:25,860
- I'm getting completely dizzy?

393
00:19:25,860 --> 00:19:26,860
- mm.

394
00:19:27,740 --> 00:19:29,020
- I would probably spit it out.

395
00:19:29,020 --> 00:19:31,020
- Yes, I think this is the location now huh?

396
00:19:31,020 --> 00:19:33,020
- I think you got a Nickokick.

397
00:19:33,020 --> 00:19:35,020
Congratulations!

398
00:19:35,020 --> 00:19:36,300
- Thanks.

399
00:19:36,300 --> 00:19:38,300
- Which one like a cute personality you have.

400
00:19:38,660 --> 00:19:39,140
- Oh really?

401
00:19:39,140 --> 00:19:41,700
- You feel so damn giggling and warm all the time.

402
00:19:41,700 --> 00:19:43,900
- Well, that's not what my wife says.

403
00:19:43,900 --> 00:19:51,420
It is difficult.
 It's women.
 They're going to talk.
 It should be talked about.

404
00:19:57,740 --> 00:20:01,380
With the great insight about women we left Enskede.

405
00:20:01,460 --> 00:20:05,380
But also with a gratitude for living in a country where it is the most fun of the most fun.

406
00:20:05,460 --> 00:20:11,460
Namely guys who own construction companies, at the same time can be exactly this cute.

407
00:20:11,460 --> 00:20:14,380
Now, however, we are moving on to the number four of the list.

408
00:20:14,380 --> 00:20:19,500
- And now it will be about a Swedish lookalike to the world's most famous actress.

409
00:20:19,500 --> 00:20:23,220
It will be about Tjörns Leonardo DiCaprio.

410
00:20:24,340 --> 00:20:25,340
Hey!

411
00:20:25,340 --> 00:20:26,340
- Hey Hey.

412
00:20:28,500 --> 00:20:30,020
You are like, after all.

413
00:20:30,020 --> 00:20:34,540
You have no filter or anything.
 That's you.

414
00:20:35,100 --> 00:20:37,140
- No, I'll show that I have no filter.

415
00:20:37,140 --> 00:20:39,260
- Now you are even more similar from this angle.

416
00:20:39,260 --> 00:20:45,260
- Haha, yes thank you.
 It's fun to hear that I could be helpful.

417
00:20:45,260 --> 00:20:49,020
- It was incredibly fun to talk to Tjörn Leonardo DiCaprio.

418
00:20:49,020 --> 00:20:52,860
- It was incredibly nice to talk to Mauri aka Ed Sheeran on stilts.

419
00:20:52,860 --> 00:20:56,060
- Haha okay.
 Thanks.

420
00:20:56,060 --> 00:20:59,260
And now it's time for the list number three.

421
00:20:59,260 --> 00:21:04,620
- And now we will meet a girl who is very similar, one of Sweden's largest international actors.

422
00:21:04,620 --> 00:21:08,331
We will meet Malmös Malmö Åkerman.

423
00:21:12,393 --> 00:21:14,506
- Oh damn!

424
00:21:15,799 --> 00:21:17,411
- Hi Malin.

425
00:21:17,411 --> 00:21:19,411
- Mauri, nice.

426
00:21:21,569 --> 00:21:25,424
Hi, my name is Malin Åkerman.
 I am 29 years old and work as a contracting engineer.

427
00:21:28,271 --> 00:21:31,271
- Now you are even more like her.

428
00:21:31,271 --> 00:21:32,569
- It's just growing.

429
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:34,720
- Do you know the actor Malin Åkerman?

430
00:21:34,794 --> 00:21:35,794
- Yes.

431
00:21:36,180 --> 00:21:39,180
- If you were to ask a question to Malin Åkerman, what would it be?

432
00:21:39,180 --> 00:21:41,180
- Oh, no idea.

433
00:21:41,180 --> 00:21:43,180
- It's not every day it goes around a Hollywood actress in Malmö?

434
00:21:43,180 --> 00:21:44,180
- It really isn't.

435
00:21:44,180 --> 00:21:46,180
Are you at home on Christmas visits then or?

436
00:21:46,180 --> 00:21:47,180
- Yes.

437
00:21:47,180 --> 00:21:48,180
- Lovely!

438
00:21:48,180 --> 00:21:49,180
- Do you know Malin Åkerman?

439
00:21:49,180 --> 00:21:50,180
- Do you?

440
00:21:50,180 --> 00:21:52,180
- No, okay.

441
00:21:53,180 --> 00:21:56,180
- What series have you seen with her?
 Do you remember who?

442
00:21:56,180 --> 00:22:02,180
- Oh most movies.
 You were with Ryan Reynolds and she Sandra Bullock was it well?

443
00:22:02,180 --> 00:22:03,180
The proposal.

444
00:22:03,180 --> 00:22:04,180
- Yes exactly.

445
00:22:04,180 --> 00:22:05,180
- Yes exactly.

446
00:22:05,180 --> 00:22:06,180
Yes, I remember a little.

447
00:22:06,180 --> 00:22:09,180
- Yes, it feels a bit like that to go around and lie.

448
00:22:09,180 --> 00:22:10,180
- Well!

449
00:22:10,180 --> 00:22:13,180
- Would you like to cut a Hollywood actress?

450
00:22:13,180 --> 00:22:14,180
- Clearly!

451
00:22:14,180 --> 00:22:15,180
- Do you recognize her?

452
00:22:15,180 --> 00:22:16,180
- Yes!

453
00:22:16,180 --> 00:22:17,180
- Who is it?

454
00:22:17,180 --> 00:22:18,180
- Malin Åkerman.

455
00:22:18,180 --> 00:22:21,180
- Would you say you have a good look at Malin Åkerman?

456
00:22:21,180 --> 00:22:22,180
- Yes.

457
00:22:22,180 --> 00:22:25,180
- If I were to say that this is not Malin Åkerman?

458
00:22:29,180 --> 00:22:31,180
- You are completely in your own world.

459
00:22:31,180 --> 00:22:32,700
- But you look exactly the same?

460
00:22:32,700 --> 00:22:34,500
- I know if we look exactly the same.

461
00:22:34,500 --> 00:22:35,500
- May I ask you something?

462
00:22:39,500 --> 00:22:40,940
- What did he say?
 Rather, do I die?

463
00:22:40,940 --> 00:22:41,540
Did he say that?

464
00:22:41,540 --> 00:22:42,660
- Did he rather die I?

465
00:22:42,660 --> 00:22:43,820
- I think so.

466
00:22:43,820 --> 00:22:46,140
- He dies rather than answer a question.

467
00:22:47,340 --> 00:22:48,940
- You are like Malin Åkerman.

468
00:22:48,940 --> 00:22:49,700
- mm.

469
00:22:49,700 --> 00:22:52,940
- But then how good the actress are you?

470
00:22:52,940 --> 00:22:55,260
- I don't think I'm such a good actor.

471
00:22:55,260 --> 00:22:57,980
- But okay, now we take this.
 Now I dump you.

472
00:22:57,980 --> 00:22:59,260
And then you get really sad.

473
00:22:59,260 --> 00:23:02,100
Now I'm a douche that dumps you.

474
00:23:02,260 --> 00:23:04,260
Are you ready?

475
00:23:14,820 --> 00:23:18,980
You ... I want to end, I thought.

476
00:23:19,140 --> 00:23:22,340
- So, you're sure?
 - Yes, I wanted to end you.

477
00:23:22,500 --> 00:23:26,420
PGA has infidelity, which I have been doing.

478
00:23:26,420 --> 00:23:28,420
- You've been in infidelity.

479
00:23:28,420 --> 00:23:29,420
- Yes.

480
00:23:30,420 --> 00:23:32,420
- Okay, so it's just from nowhere?

481
00:23:32,420 --> 00:23:33,420
- mm.

482
00:23:33,420 --> 00:23:34,420
- Why?

483
00:23:34,420 --> 00:23:35,420
- infidelity.

484
00:23:35,420 --> 00:23:36,420
- huh?

485
00:23:36,420 --> 00:23:37,420
- mm.

486
00:23:39,420 --> 00:23:40,420
- Who?

487
00:23:41,420 --> 00:23:42,420
- Rather which.

488
00:23:47,420 --> 00:23:48,420
- Who is she then?

489
00:23:48,420 --> 00:23:49,420
- Ehh from the Baltic.

490
00:23:49,420 --> 00:23:50,420
- From Balti ...

491
00:23:50,420 --> 00:23:52,420
Hahahaha

492
00:23:52,420 --> 00:23:55,048
- She lives below.

493
00:23:56,420 --> 00:23:58,420
- In the basement?

494
00:23:58,420 --> 00:24:00,420
Hahahaha

495
00:24:00,420 --> 00:24:02,420
- You're kind of good!

496
00:24:02,420 --> 00:24:04,420
You were kind of pretty good.

497
00:24:04,420 --> 00:24:06,420
It was kind of strong.

498
00:24:06,420 --> 00:24:08,420
- Ah?
 No...

499
00:24:08,420 --> 00:24:10,420
- Thanks for meeting you.

500
00:24:10,420 --> 00:24:12,420
- Thanks for coming.

501
00:24:12,420 --> 00:24:14,420
- It's damn sick how similar you are.

502
00:24:14,420 --> 00:24:16,420
- A final time.

503
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:23,220
Now it is time for both number one and two on the list, as we will soon reconcile them as a duo.

504
00:24:23,220 --> 00:24:26,780
- Now it will be about Claes Eriksson from Leif & Billy.

505
00:24:26,780 --> 00:24:31,980
He has an absolutely incredible lookalike, we suspect, far down in southern Sweden.

506
00:24:31,980 --> 00:24:38,700
Today I have attracted him from Blekinge to Stockholm, because we two have big plans.

507
00:24:38,700 --> 00:24:42,220
You are joking!

508
00:24:42,220 --> 00:24:43,500
- Hey!

509
00:24:43,500 --> 00:24:47,140
- It's so sick!

510
00:24:50,500 --> 00:24:55,460
My name is Claes Eriksson and I am a county coordinator in mental health in Blekinge in county.

511
00:24:56,180 --> 00:24:57,580
- It's so sick!

512
00:24:57,580 --> 00:24:58,300
- Hey!

513
00:24:58,300 --> 00:24:59,740
- Satan what nice!

514
00:24:59,740 --> 00:25:03,020
You have the same hairstyle and beard and stuff too.

515
00:25:03,020 --> 00:25:04,540
- Yes, and birth mark even.

516
00:25:04,900 --> 00:25:05,420
- huh?

517
00:25:05,660 --> 00:25:08,260
Oh damn, he also has a birth mark there!

518
00:25:08,260 --> 00:25:11,540
You are joking in the same place!

519
00:25:11,540 --> 00:25:14,300
- I cheated my mom and sent a picture to her and said I had cut myself.

520
00:25:14,300 --> 00:25:15,300
But then it was a picture of Claes.

521
00:25:15,300 --> 00:25:17,140
- What so even your mom?

522
00:25:17,140 --> 00:25:17,980
- She went on it.

523
00:25:17,980 --> 00:25:19,980
- And you and I, we have some plans.

524
00:25:19,980 --> 00:25:20,700
- We have some plans.

525
00:25:20,700 --> 00:25:25,020
- We have also found the lookook for Billy.

526
00:25:25,660 --> 00:25:30,540
-Okay, now we are at the T-Centralen and we will receive the Alfred lookalic.

527
00:25:30,540 --> 00:25:32,300
Which comes in all the way from Småland.

528
00:25:35,620 --> 00:25:36,220
Is that so?

529
00:25:36,220 --> 00:25:36,740
Yes.

530
00:25:38,340 --> 00:25:39,020
- Thanks so much.

531
00:25:39,020 --> 00:25:39,900
- Thanks.

532
00:25:39,900 --> 00:25:40,740
Have a good day.

533
00:25:40,740 --> 00:25:44,420
- damn, how fast it went.

534
00:25:45,700 --> 00:25:49,140
- There comes our Alfred.
 Hello!

535
00:25:49,300 --> 00:25:51,300
- Hi Andreas.

536
00:25:53,300 --> 00:25:58,500
My name is Alfred Svensson and I am a plumbing engineer.

537
00:25:58,660 --> 00:26:01,500
-Hey.
 - Hi, Claes.

538
00:26:01,660 --> 00:26:04,140
--Oj, Satan, no?

539
00:26:04,300 --> 00:26:05,920
- Her god, what the same.

540
00:26:05,920 --> 00:26:07,920
- And the best thing about you is that you are quite similar, Alfred.

541
00:26:08,580 --> 00:26:10,260
But you are also similar in a different way.

542
00:26:10,260 --> 00:26:13,340
- We were born and raised in the same city, both in Vimmerby.

543
00:26:13,340 --> 00:26:14,020
- Yes.

544
00:26:14,020 --> 00:26:18,260
- We discovered both theater through the same theater association in Vimmerby.

545
00:26:18,260 --> 00:26:22,540
- And then we both have trained as actors at Kalle Flygare here in Stockholm.

546
00:26:22,900 --> 00:26:23,780
- And there they are.

547
00:26:25,180 --> 00:26:26,420
The real ni.

548
00:26:26,700 --> 00:26:28,460
- Because here they play their show today.

549
00:26:28,460 --> 00:26:32,220
And of course we should go in and meet your original.

550
00:26:32,220 --> 00:26:33,260
- Lol!

551
00:26:33,260 --> 00:26:34,140
Damn what fun!

552
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:38,000
- But first change.

553
00:26:46,728 --> 00:26:47,728
Hello!

554
00:26:48,654 --> 00:26:51,654
Wait, get a little closer.
 You just said they are awesome.

555
00:26:53,657 --> 00:26:54,657
Hello!

556
00:27:03,094 --> 00:27:04,334
- Do you recognize them?

557
00:27:05,648 --> 00:27:06,648
- Claes!

558
00:27:08,580 --> 00:27:09,580
- Yes, yes, yes.

559
00:27:13,980 --> 00:27:19,300
And while the selfies hail, the originals made ready to meet their copies.

560
00:27:19,660 --> 00:27:23,380
- I am afraid that it will be so similar that I get existential scams.

561
00:27:23,700 --> 00:27:24,700
- Yes!

562
00:27:25,140 --> 00:27:26,140
I die.

563
00:27:26,140 --> 00:27:27,620
Why am I dying?

564
00:27:27,620 --> 00:27:29,180
- Everyone is so nervous!

565
00:27:29,700 --> 00:27:30,540
Oh my God!

566
00:27:30,540 --> 00:27:32,540
Come and look!
 Here you have them!

567
00:27:33,620 --> 00:27:34,620
- Hey!

568
00:27:34,940 --> 00:27:36,260
- Oh damn!

569
00:27:36,260 --> 00:27:39,380
But but, fuck what sick!
 Oh that's so damn sick!

570
00:27:40,460 --> 00:27:43,340
- What is it?
 So I get a scam of this.
 Oh god what strange this is.

571
00:27:43,340 --> 00:27:44,340
Servant, hello you!

572
00:27:45,380 --> 00:27:46,380
- Damn what special!

573
00:27:47,260 --> 00:27:48,460
- So I have to say ...

574
00:27:48,700 --> 00:27:50,780
- I really agree.

575
00:27:51,380 --> 00:27:52,380
It's damn sick.

576
00:27:52,620 --> 00:27:54,020
But I'm totally wandged.

577
00:27:54,020 --> 00:27:57,180
Because there are extreme similarities.

578
00:27:57,180 --> 00:28:01,780
- You have birthmarks in the same places.

579
00:28:01,940 --> 00:28:03,740
- It's actually totally sick.

580
00:28:03,900 --> 00:28:10,300
- We have some plans tonight.
 You have a sold out show here at Scala all winter.

581
00:28:10,460 --> 00:28:12,540
You drive tonight.

582
00:28:12,700 --> 00:28:18,780
- Yes, we would have liked you two to go up and take the evening.

583
00:28:23,205 --> 00:28:24,645
- Oh, damn.

584
00:28:24,645 --> 00:28:26,608
- I get shitty too.

585
00:28:27,320 --> 00:28:28,756
- Say this: Servant!

586
00:28:28,904 --> 00:28:30,202
My name is Billy Öhman.

587
00:28:30,349 --> 00:28:32,160
- My name is Billy Öhman.

588
00:28:32,349 --> 00:28:33,980
- Well, you think you will have fun.
 Tonight?

589
00:28:34,387 --> 00:28:36,793
- Well, do you think you will have fun tonight?

590
00:28:36,793 --> 00:28:38,085
- Hahaha.

591
00:28:38,085 --> 00:28:39,383
- It is almost after all.

592
00:28:39,420 --> 00:28:41,420
- Do you think you will have fun tonight?

593
00:28:41,457 --> 00:28:43,457
- It's fun, it's just fun.

594
00:28:44,381 --> 00:28:46,381
Damn what fun it is to be here in the big city.

595
00:28:47,082 --> 00:28:49,082
- Damn what fun it is to be here in the big city.

596
00:28:49,082 --> 00:28:51,045
Hahahaha.

597
00:28:51,045 --> 00:28:53,045
- Is this your interpretation of Northern?

598
00:28:53,060 --> 00:28:55,540
- Damn what fun it is to be here in the big city!

599
00:28:55,540 --> 00:29:00,460
- Yes, but it's fun.
 For this audience will be like this ... What is happening now?

600
00:29:00,460 --> 00:29:01,300
- Yes!

601
00:29:01,595 --> 00:29:03,308
- Ohhhh Hey!

602
00:29:04,700 --> 00:29:07,380
How would the unaware audience react?

603
00:29:07,380 --> 00:29:10,780
How long would it take before they realized that something was wrong?

604
00:29:11,060 --> 00:29:12,140
- Now it's close.

605
00:29:12,140 --> 00:29:14,140
- Now it's close.

606
00:29:17,279 --> 00:29:22,326
The show is about an hour and 20 minutes long, in an act without a passport.

607
00:29:22,326 --> 00:29:23,920
But now it's time.

608
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:28,920
- My ladies and gentlemen, give a warm applause to Leif and Billy!

609
00:29:34,724 --> 00:29:35,575
- Hello

610
00:29:35,575 --> 00:29:36,084
- Ah.

611
00:29:36,084 --> 00:29:37,052
Hello Hello!

612
00:29:37,052 --> 00:29:37,933
- Hello Hello!

613
00:29:38,026 --> 00:29:39,208
- Are you tagged?

614
00:29:39,208 --> 00:29:40,208
- Yes!

615
00:29:40,422 --> 00:29:41,422
Are they going on it?

616
00:29:43,140 --> 00:29:45,140
- There is no funeral here.
 Are you tagged?

617
00:29:45,140 --> 00:29:47,140
- Yes!

618
00:29:47,140 --> 00:29:49,657
- God Cursed Billy.
 We will introduce ourselves first.

619
00:29:49,657 --> 00:29:51,140
- Yes, of course.

620
00:29:51,140 --> 00:29:53,140
I'm Billy Öhman.

621
00:29:53,140 --> 00:29:55,140
And this is my brother.

622
00:29:55,140 --> 00:29:57,140
- I'm Leif.

623
00:29:57,509 --> 00:30:01,731
And it was somewhere where it started to get up for people that something wasn't right.

624
00:30:01,731 --> 00:30:05,694
And the remaining minutes on stage, became a bit of a nightmare.

625
00:30:06,617 --> 00:30:09,023
- Yes, today we will see a wonderful show!

626
00:30:12,871 --> 00:30:14,871
- This is a disaster.

627
00:30:15,313 --> 00:30:17,313
- What happens?
 Does it work or?

628
00:30:17,757 --> 00:30:19,757
- I think we would drive Småland huh?

629
00:30:19,867 --> 00:30:21,018
Or how was it?

630
00:30:21,018 --> 00:30:22,575
- I do not know.
 What do you think?

631
00:30:22,575 --> 00:30:24,574
Northern or Småland?

632
00:30:25,423 --> 00:30:27,017
Northern, yes okay.

633
00:30:27,092 --> 00:30:28,501
- Okay, then we shit in it.

634
00:30:28,572 --> 00:30:30,424
Then we drive in Småland anyway.

635
00:30:30,591 --> 00:30:32,000
- It doesn't work we have to enter.

636
00:30:32,040 --> 00:30:33,140
- In in!

637
00:30:34,660 --> 00:30:36,660
- In hell!

638
00:30:40,660 --> 00:30:42,660
God damn!

639
00:30:43,140 --> 00:30:45,140
Didn't you say you could Northern?

640
00:30:46,340 --> 00:30:47,340
- I can do that.

641
00:30:47,820 --> 00:30:49,820
- So, go out this way.
 It is good.

642
00:30:49,820 --> 00:30:51,820
An applause!
