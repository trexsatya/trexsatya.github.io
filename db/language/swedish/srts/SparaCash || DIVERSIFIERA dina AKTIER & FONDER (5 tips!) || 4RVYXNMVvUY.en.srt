1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
You have probably heard that you should not lay all the eggs in the same basket.

2
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:14,000
In this video we will go through how to diversify its portfolio.

3
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Now it is the same basket, but it is still important to have several assets in their basket.

4
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Got reconciliation at a Snickers.

5
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Allright, then we drive then.

6
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:33,000
In this video we will go through five good tips that I wish I got when I started investing.

7
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:39,000
I have seen a horribly many beginners who totally do away with them when investing.

8
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,000
So we will go through diversifications in this video.

9
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,000
It is important to spread your risk so that you do not lose money on the stock exchange.

10
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:54,000
For example, you invest all money in a company or that you may be all in cryptocurrencies or something else.

11
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,000
It can have horrific consequences for your portfolio and your money.

12
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Believe me, I've learned the hard way.

13
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:08,000
So what does it mean that you diversify your portfolio?

14
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Well, it simply means that you protect yourself against your own stupidity simply among your investments.

15
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Do you have all your money in a business?

16
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Yes, then it is true that if the company concentrates (go bankrupt) then you will lose all your money.

17
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:37,000
So for example, the seat belt, we do not have it for us to crash, but it is if we collide.

18
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:43,000
You do not know if it will go to hell.
 So it's just as good to take it safe for the uncertain.

19
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:47,791
Then run thick!
 Then drive!

20
00:01:56,195 --> 00:02:03,855
The first tip when it comes to diversifying your portfolio is not to forget that you do not just need shares or funds in your portfolio.

21
00:02:03,855 --> 00:02:10,807
Sure, when you are new then maybe it works, but when you start getting some more money in your portfolio then you may be wise to have several asset laws.

22
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:17,791
Yes, you can have art, you can have watches, you can have wine, you can have real estate.

23
00:02:17,791 --> 00:02:24,000
There is a bunch of other investments that also go up in the long term to spread the risk in your portfolio.

24
00:02:24,371 --> 00:02:27,388
Tip 2 - Diversify among multiple industries

25
00:02:27,388 --> 00:02:32,000
Now, for example, when interest rates have gone up so much, then real estate shares have got it quite tough.

26
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:35,000
And I'm sitting on some real estate shares, so it's been tough for me.

27
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:39,081
So it is important to spread among more industries.

28
00:02:39,081 --> 00:02:45,000
And a simple tip there may be to think that you have a maximum of 25% of the portfolio in an individual industry.

29
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:49,000
And then max.
 Look at several different industries.

30
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:57,226
Because it is so, if a certain industry is affected, then it may be that your entire portfolio goes down.

31
00:02:57,226 --> 00:03:01,000
And for example, American shares have been doing very well now lately.

32
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:05,000
Many people buy global funds and American tech companies.

33
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:11,000
So remember to have not too much of your entire portfolio in a particular industry or niche.

34
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:22,694
Point number three.
 Diversifying among several countries.

35
00:03:22,694 --> 00:03:25,000
The same goes for countries and regions.

36
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:28,516
This year, for example, the US stock exchange has gone very strong.

37
00:03:28,516 --> 00:03:29,581
And what happens then?

38
00:03:29,581 --> 00:03:34,355
Well, all beginners rush into American tech shares such as Nvidia and the like.

39
00:03:34,355 --> 00:03:40,403
And not only do you take a land risk here if the country goes badly, but also a currency risk.

40
00:03:40,581 --> 00:03:45,307
If it goes the other way, for example, that the Swedish krona is now becoming stronger against the dollar,

41
00:03:45,307 --> 00:03:48,678
Yes, then maybe it is a 20% downside there.
 We don't know that.

42
00:03:48,678 --> 00:03:52,000
But of course the big risk here is the individual country.

43
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:57,000
For example, if you only buy Chinese shares, then you take a very large political risk.

44
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:01,920
But yes, if the country goes badly, yes, then your entire portfolio of shit goes of course.

45
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:05,000
And for example, I have had a lot of Sweden in my portfolio.

46
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:09,000
And yes, then you have to take that bang that the Swedish currency has gone bad

47
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:12,000
And that you have missed a lot of rise in the United States.

48
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:18,000
I have a little US in the portfolio, but it is still good to think about having more countries and regions in your portfolio.

49
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:24,000
So please mix Swedish, American, maybe a little European and then maybe spice up with some emerging countries.

50
00:04:33,340 --> 00:04:36,872
Tip number four, invest in more assets than just shares and funds.

51
00:04:36,946 --> 00:04:40,132
I am very focused on mostly shares and funds.

52
00:04:40,531 --> 00:04:44,600
But what many do not know is that I have many more investment assets in the portfolio than that.

53
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:48,423
For example, I have peer-to-peer loans, I have cryptocurrencies,

54
00:04:48,505 --> 00:04:52,134
I have cash in the portfolio and some other sprinkle investments.

55
00:04:52,134 --> 00:04:54,134
This year for example, not many people think about it,

56
00:04:54,134 --> 00:04:57,457
But Bitcoin has gone up almost 90% seen in SEK.

57
00:04:57,457 --> 00:04:59,732
It can be a fun spice to one's portfolio.

58
00:04:59,732 --> 00:05:03,183
Sure it's a cloud comfort to me now that the stock market has gone so extremely bad,

59
00:05:03,183 --> 00:05:08,178
But it is still nice to feel that you have some other asset in a portfolio that has gone well.

60
00:05:08,178 --> 00:05:13,178
At the same time, having some money on savings account with interest today you get 3-4% in a savings account.

61
00:05:13,178 --> 00:05:18,019
Maybe a little peer-to-peer loan also that was a comfort last year for example, is quite nice.

62
00:05:18,019 --> 00:05:20,762
And we get into cryptocurrencies and things like bitcoin.

63
00:05:20,762 --> 00:05:23,019
Yes, it is an extremely high risk!

64
00:05:23,099 --> 00:05:29,099
But a proposal there could be to have a maximum of 5-10% of your total portfolio against cryptocurrencies.

65
00:05:29,099 --> 00:05:33,040
Some others advocate gold, silver and other precious metals,

66
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:38,019
But digital currencies, yes, they have actually historically given a pretty nice return over time.

67
00:05:38,099 --> 00:05:40,099
But as I said, think about the high risk.

68
00:05:42,840 --> 00:05:46,000
And speaking of Bitcoin and Ethereum, we come quite naturally to XBT Provider,

69
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
which is the sponsor of today's video.

70
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:54,904
Through XBT, such as Bitcoin-XBT, Ethereum-XBT, you can get exposure to cryptocurrencies

71
00:05:54,904 --> 00:05:58,645
In a very simple way through, for example, Avanza and Nordnet.

72
00:05:58,645 --> 00:06:01,000
It is very easy to buy them only when the stock exchange is open,

73
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:05,000
And you have them on the side of your shares and funds in your very ordinary investment account.

74
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:08,613
For example, on an investment savings account (ISK) or a capital insurance (KF)

75
00:06:08,613 --> 00:06:13,000
which means you don't have to declare if you buy cryptocurrencies in a normal way,

76
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
Because it can be a little difficult.

77
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:19,000
So it easier to buy them there, for example, than to do it yourself over a stock exchange

78
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:22,000
Where it can be a bit problematic to get the money and such stuff.

79
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:27,000
XBT Provider was the first in Europe to launch such a bitcoin certificate.

80
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:31,000
They are regulated by Finansinspektionen and you can go to their proof of reserves yourself

81
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,000
and see their full transparency.

82
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:37,887
In addition, their main company Coinshares is listed on Nasdaq Stockholm.

83
00:06:37,887 --> 00:06:41,904
If you want to know more about Bitcoin XBT and Ethereum XBT, there are links to the products here

84
00:06:41,904 --> 00:06:44,904
during the video in the description and comments field.

85
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,162
Thanks to XBT who sponsors this video.

86
00:06:47,162 --> 00:06:49,855
Tip number five.
 Invest regularly.

87
00:06:49,855 --> 00:06:53,484
What many do on the stock exchange when one's investment goes bad

88
00:06:53,484 --> 00:06:56,597
is that you put your head in the sand and do nothing.

89
00:06:56,597 --> 00:07:01,226
You may be waiting for it to just turn around and that it should look good once you log in three months later,

90
00:07:01,226 --> 00:07:05,307
But the best purchases are usually made in the worst times.

91
00:07:05,307 --> 00:07:09,629
So make sure to invest all the time, so buy a little neighbor all the time.

92
00:07:09,629 --> 00:07:13,920
And my tip is usually to always have a fund savings every month

93
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:17,436
So that you always buy a little neighbor all the time when it goes up and down.

94
00:07:17,436 --> 00:07:19,339
But the same goes for shares.

95
00:07:19,339 --> 00:07:24,000
What many do, including myself, is that you tend to buy shares on tops

96
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:28,000
When everyone talks about the stock exchange and it is hottest.

97
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:31,000
But it is now when maybe no one is talking about shares and the stock exchange

98
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
As it might be a place to buy a little.

99
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
Then it depends on which company of course.

100
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:39,000
But instead of pushing all the money at once in shares,

101
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:43,000
Therefore, make sure to spread the purchases and drove you in.

102
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:47,000
If you have 10,000 to invest in shares, perhaps divide it into smaller portions,

103
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:52,000
Maybe a thousand kronor at a time, so you take in a little when it goes up and a little when it goes down.

104
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:56,549
For time you get a good average price, yes, which is better for you in the end.

105
00:07:56,549 --> 00:08:01,000
And then you also reduce the risk of buying on a top and selling on a bottom.

106
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:04,000
So do you have any tips on how to best diversify their portfolio?

107
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:08,000
Maybe something that I forgot in the video so feel free to write it in a comment below.

00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:11,000
