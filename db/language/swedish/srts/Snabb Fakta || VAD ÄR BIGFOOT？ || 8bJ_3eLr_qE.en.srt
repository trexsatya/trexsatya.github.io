00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:12,780
What is bigfoot?
 We will find out today.

2
00:00:12,780 --> 00:00:25,980
For several years, people around the world have been fascinated by the legend of Bigfoot.
 Several people have talked about their meetings with the hairy beast.

3
00:00:25,980 --> 00:00:32,580
A large and hairy alar -like creature that goes on two legs.

4
00:00:32,580 --> 00:00:46,520
But even though there is no definitive evidence of Bigfoot's existence, new reports on possible meetings with Bigfoot continue to emerge even today.

5
00:00:46,520 --> 00:00:53,580
Today we will dive into the legend of Bigfoot to go through the most famous ...

6
00:00:53,580 --> 00:01:03,900
And perhaps most convincingly so -called "evidence" and hopefully get an answer to the question that everyone is asking.

7
00:01:03,900 --> 00:01:07,660
Is Bigfoot for real?

8
00:01:07,660 --> 00:01:11,900
In this video we will go through the following things:

9
00:01:11,900 --> 00:01:14,900
What is bigfoot for something?

10
00:01:14,900 --> 00:01:18,300
How did Bigfoot began to spread?

11
00:01:18,300 --> 00:01:21,300
What is the evidence?

12
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:27,640
And finally.. Is Bigfoot for real or is everything a scam?

13
00:01:31,300 --> 00:01:34,300
What is bigfoot?

14
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:41,460
Bigfoot is a large alar -like creature that is said to be in the forests in North America.

15
00:01:41,460 --> 00:01:46,880
It goes on two legs, which we humans do and have a dark coat.

16
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:50,840
The body should be very muscular and broad -axled.

17
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:55,820
The length of Bigfoot is somewhere between 2-3 meters.

18
00:01:55,820 --> 00:02:04,480
Bigfoot leaves large human -like footprints behind.
 Hence the name..bigfoot

19
00:02:04,480 --> 00:02:16,220
Those who are said to have seen Bigfoot say that the face has character traits similar to a person's but that it also resembles a gorillas.

20
00:02:16,220 --> 00:02:25,040
Bigfoot should also have a very unpleasant and peculiar smell.
 A stench that feels at a very long distance.

21
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:29,000
Bigfoot is what is called a cryptozoolological creature.

22
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:36,540
It is a collective name for a number of different animal species that have not been proven by science.

23
00:02:36,540 --> 00:02:49,800
Examples of these are Storsjöodjuret, Loch Ness beast, Chupacabra, Yeti [Snowman] and others.

24
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:58,460
The most common theory that flourishes about bigfoot is that it is a kind of undetected species of a primate.

25
00:02:58,460 --> 00:03:08,880
An alar -like creature, but still more intelligent and developed than any other primate that we know.

26
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:18,360
How did Bigfoot began to spread?

27
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:22,840
The legend of Bigfoot is not as old as you might think.

28
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:41,040
It all started on August 20, 1958, when a forest worker named Jerry Crew outside the community of Willow Creek in Northern California, USA was a strange discovery.

29
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:56,540
When he came to work that day he saw unnaturally large footsteps in the ground.
 The footprints were discovered at a river called Bluff Creek.

30
00:03:56,540 --> 00:04:10,840
After that, more people in the workplace began to tell us that they had also seen similar footsteps and that they had been involved in inexplicable events in the workplace.

31
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:20,180
Among other things, an oil barrel that should have weighed over 200 kg had disappeared for a day without any explanation.

32
00:04:20,180 --> 00:04:29,280
Some of the workers also told me that they felt observed sometimes when they worked late in the evenings ...

33
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:37,940
The casts were made of the footprints and they turned out that the footprints were about 40 cm long.

34
00:04:37,940 --> 00:04:46,320
Hence the natural name of the creature that made these footsteps ... Bigfoot.

35
00:04:46,320 --> 00:05:01,880
It didn't take long before the history of a large and hairy best that left large footsteps began to spread in the United States, first from mouth to mouth and then from newspaper to newspaper.

36
00:05:01,880 --> 00:05:09,800
In October, 1958, the footprints were on the first page of the local news magazine.

37
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:17,140
Soon, the rumor of Bigfoot had spread throughout the country.

38
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:24,040
What is the evidence?

39
00:05:24,040 --> 00:05:28,300
What evidence do we have for Bigfoot's existence?

40
00:05:28,300 --> 00:05:33,880
What we talked about was exactly the footprints at the River Bluff Creek.
 However, these are not the only footprints.

41
00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:47,960
There are ... 100's of different pictures of different footsteps that people think they belong to Bigfoot or Snökannen.

42
00:05:47,960 --> 00:05:55,380
Is it proof that Bigfoot exists or is it just footprints from eg.
 a bear?

43
00:05:55,380 --> 00:05:58,380
We will come to it a little later.

44
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:10,600
At the beginning of July 2008, two hunters from Georgia in the United States emerged, Rick Dyer and Matthew Whitton.

45
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:16,900
They claimed that they had found a dead bigfoot in the forests of northern Georgia.

46
00:06:16,900 --> 00:06:27,580
The news quickly spread to several major American news channels BBC, CNN, ABC News and Fox News, among other things.

47
00:06:27,580 --> 00:06:36,400
In fact, the hunters had even been supported by a researcher that it could very well be Bigfoot.

48
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:42,720
But was it real?
 We go through it in a little while.

49
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:55,520
First, we have to look at other so -called evidence.
 There are actually several occasions where people have managed to get Bigfoot on film.

50
00:06:55,520 --> 00:07:00,500
I thought we were looking at 4 of them.

51
00:07:06,660 --> 00:07:17,820
The first film shows "Bigfoot" which goes among the bushes and then it picks up its child in its arms and goes out of the picture.

52
00:07:17,820 --> 00:07:24,780
Some claim that this is a clear proof that Bigfoot actually exists while others say

53
00:07:24,780 --> 00:07:30,600
That it is simply just a man with a gorilla costume.

54
00:07:41,020 --> 00:07:53,680
The second movie is from 2011 when a family is up among the mountains, unfortunately it is unknown where they were.

55
00:07:53,680 --> 00:08:02,320
They let the son practice sniper and a helicopter floats above them while this happens.

56
00:08:02,320 --> 00:08:10,080
When the young boy on the movie shoots a shot, you can see something moving on the right of the movie.

57
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:13,080
Let's look.

58
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:22,040
Did you see?
 We look again.

59
00:08:26,020 --> 00:08:29,020
What is running over there among the bushes?

60
00:08:29,020 --> 00:08:37,380
It moves very humanly but unfortunately it is too far away to say exactly what it is.

61
00:08:37,380 --> 00:08:41,040
Was it scared of the shot?
 Who knows.

62
00:08:41,040 --> 00:08:50,900
The family was obviously wondering why the helicopter was there, but now they believe it chased Bigfoot.

63
00:08:53,240 --> 00:09:04,260
Third film, filmed by an unknown person on December 29, 2009 in Carbondale Pennsylvania.

64
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:16,440
The person in the video walks around the woods on the back of their house after hearing noise out there.

65
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:22,740
At 41 seconds into the video, Bigfoot shows up among the trees.

66
00:09:28,300 --> 00:09:37,980
What differs from the other films is that Bigfoot is white.
 A so -called Albino Bigfoot.

67
00:09:37,980 --> 00:09:44,000
The fourth movie, the movie that is perhaps best known.

68
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:56,040
It was filmed by Roger Patterson in 1967 when he was to film a documentary about Bigfoot on the River Bluff Creek.

69
00:09:56,040 --> 00:09:59,040
Let's look.

70
00:10:04,120 --> 00:10:10,140
In the film, we clearly see an alar -like creature that goes on two legs as a human being.

71
00:10:10,140 --> 00:10:14,980
The creature also turns to the camera at one time.

72
00:10:14,980 --> 00:10:31,480
The film is still used today as evidence of Bigfoot's existence of the Bigfoot fantasies while others again just think it is a man in a gorilla costume.

73
00:10:35,380 --> 00:10:44,480
What all movies have in common is that they are filmed at a distance and that Bigfoot is blurred and difficult to see.

74
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:51,380
So either ... it is simply a coincidence that it just happened to be so when you were filming ..

75
00:10:51,380 --> 00:10:58,000
Or ... so maybe bigfoot is blurred.

76
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,440
Joking aside.

77
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:09,280
These 4 films are only a fraction of a certainly 1000's of different pictures and films that people have taken on "Bigfoot".

78
00:11:09,280 --> 00:11:16,340
But no picture or film has become a definitive evidence of Bigfoot's existence.

79
00:11:17,520 --> 00:11:26,760
And then we come the last question ... Is Bigfoot for real or is everything a scam?

80
00:11:26,760 --> 00:11:38,960
Here we have to rewind a little to the footprints found on the river Bluff Creek by forest worker Jerry Crew 1958.

81
00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:43,940
In 2002, however, the truth emerged.

82
00:11:43,940 --> 00:11:54,560
It turned out that the father of a forest workers had secretly made the footprints with their own homemade footprints of wood

83
00:11:54,560 --> 00:12:05,960
As he simply just entered his own feet like a pair of big flip-flops and then he trampled around the clay around the river Bluff Creek.

84
00:12:05,960 --> 00:12:13,700
You know the hunters Rick Dyer and Matthew Whitton who found a dead bigfoot that they had placed in a freezer box?

85
00:12:13,700 --> 00:12:23,620
It was revealed that Bigfoot: One that lay in the freezer was in fact a masquerade costume from an American website named The Horror Dome.

86
00:12:23,620 --> 00:12:27,440
And that "researcher" who supported their claim?

87
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:31,980
Yes, the "researcher" was, in fact, brother of one of the hunters.

88
00:12:31,980 --> 00:12:42,400
Real researchers had been involved when their bigfoot thawed and it was quickly discovered that the head was hollow and their feet were made of rubber.

89
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:45,400
Then we have the movies.

90
00:12:45,400 --> 00:12:54,140
The difficult thing about proving or disproving Bigfoot's existence is that it is so incredibly easy to fake.

91
00:12:54,140 --> 00:13:03,040
Place a man in a gorilla costume in the forest, stand far away with a camera and voila!
 Bigfoot.

92
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:08,820
Hence the first 3 films I showed difficult to give any explanation for.

93
00:13:08,820 --> 00:13:17,960
But the fourth movie, the first movie ever that came out on Bigfoot there is actually an explanation for.

94
00:13:17,960 --> 00:13:26,960
In 1998, a man at Man Bob Heironimus emerged and said "I am the bigfoot".

95
00:13:26,960 --> 00:13:39,360
Okay, he didn't say exactly that, but he told me he had been a friend of Roger Patterson and got paid by him to put on a gorilla costume and walk around in front of the camera.

96
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:54,200
Another person was called Philip Morris in 2002, who told me that he ran a company like the 60s that produced different kinds of costumes and other props for magic numbers.

97
00:13:54,200 --> 00:14:01,820
He remembers that he sold a gorilla costume to a person in 1967 via mail order.

98
00:14:01,820 --> 00:14:09,360
The buyer must have stood as R. Patterson.

99
00:14:14,640 --> 00:14:26,380
And now that all these different evidence has proven to be a scam, it was perhaps thought that the legend of Bigfoot would die out.

100
00:14:26,380 --> 00:14:29,380
But that did not happen.

101
00:14:29,380 --> 00:14:39,300
The news The various bluffs were ignored by the Bigfoot enthusiasts and the interest in Bigfoot has instead become even greater.

102
00:14:39,300 --> 00:14:48,560
Today, there are clubs and organizations in the United States whose sole purpose is to search for bigfoot.

103
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:51,560
A little strange how we humans work sometimes ..

104
00:14:52,800 --> 00:15:07,920
Although the name Bigfoot became known in 1958 in the United States, legends on various large human -like creatures have been around for centuries in the rest of the world.

105
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:15,700
For example, Yeti, also called the snowman who is said to live up in the Himalayan Mountains.

106
00:15:15,700 --> 00:15:23,040
We have the Russian creature Menk, which is Russia's version of a Yeti you can say.

107
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:27,460
Mongolia is said to have a creature called Almas.

108
00:15:27,460 --> 00:15:30,460
Vietnam has Nguoi Rung.

109
00:15:30,500 --> 00:15:33,500
Indonesia has EBU Gogo.

110
00:15:33,500 --> 00:15:35,700
China has Yeren.

111
00:15:35,700 --> 00:15:38,700
And so on and so on ...

112
00:15:38,980 --> 00:15:45,940
So I guess it doesn't really matter if it's really or if everything is a scam.

113
00:15:46,780 --> 00:15:52,140
The legend of Bigfoot will live on anyway.
