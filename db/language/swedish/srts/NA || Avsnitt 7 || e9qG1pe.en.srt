1
00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:50.880
Nice place!
 This was a great idea.

2
00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:54.280
You only celebrate years once a year.

3
00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:57.880
Thanks!

4
00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:05.680
Just what I needed!

5
00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:09.840
- A great gift.
 -Do you think?

6
00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:18.160
- So, what a nice room!
 -Yes.
 Big bed.

7
00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:22.520
Close the door, Magnus.

8
00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:28.000
Finally alone!

9
00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:31.520
Happy Birthday!

10
00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:38.200
-I have a surprise for you!
 -Oh really?

11
00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:46.320
-Congratulations!
 - Now you are old, your bastard!

12
00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:52.680
We have no time to lose.
 I have made a schedule for the activities.

13
00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:58.320
The tip walk starts in exactly seven minutes.

14
00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:02.680
You didn't think this, huh?!

15
00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:05.960
No, I didn't think so.

16
00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:13.280
There is the question.

17
00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:19.520
"On May 6, 2002, Magnus happened to break an ornament."

18
00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:26.600
What then?
 1: a plate, X: A candlestick, 2: a vase.

19
00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:29.920
It's 2: a vase.

20
00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:38.600
She has probably never forgiven me for it.

21
00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:49.600
How much was the vase worth?
 SEK 1: 500, X: SEK 4,000 -

22
00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:56.400
- Or 2: Not so much, but it meant a lot to Frida.

23
00:03:56.560 --> 00:04:02.840
- Was it worth SEK 4,000?
 - It's probably the last option.

24
00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:10.680
- Does what the girls are doing now?
 - They have some other activity.

25
00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:14.880
Tjing, tjing!

26
00:04:17.080 --> 00:04:20.400
Mm!
 God, what good wine!

27
00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:23.760
!

28
00:04:23.920 --> 00:04:29.360
- I hardly know where we are.
 - Here is the next.

29
00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:34.560
"What did Frida's grandmother say to Frida on her deathbed?"

30
00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:42.000
1: Take good care of you, X: Love is the most important thing in life -

31
00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:47.400
- Or 2: Be afraid of this vase.
 - It's 2.

32
00:04:59.520 --> 00:05:01.760
Get to hear, then!

33
00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:10.880
When Sebastian takes me, it is as if everything around is still.

34
00:05:11.040 --> 00:05:15.040
- We may be two in the world.
 -Wonderfully!

35
00:05:15.200 --> 00:05:20.480
When Magnus takes on me, it becomes electric.

36
00:05:20.640 --> 00:05:24.800
It's such an incredible erotic charge!

37
00:05:31.680 --> 00:05:35.440
When Ulf takes in me it's like ...

38
00:05:36.440 --> 00:05:39.960
... to solve crosswords!

39
00:05:41.320 --> 00:05:44.320
It makes time go.

40
00:06:10.040 --> 00:06:13.160
Surely it's over soon?

41
00:06:14.680 --> 00:06:21.640
"Why did Magnus Vasen destroy?"
 1: He's sloppy, X: Missing fine motor skills -

42
00:06:21.800 --> 00:06:26.960
- Or 2: He lacks respect for Frida and her possessions.

43
00:06:27.240 --> 00:06:29.320
Cross?

44
00:06:54.920 --> 00:06:58.960
Look here what I've found, Carita!

45
00:06:59.120 --> 00:07:02.680
- Where did you find it?
 -On the ground.

46
00:07:02.840 --> 00:07:08.600
Nice pictures!
 It's a guest house.
 Do you know what I've been thinking about?

47
00:07:08.760 --> 00:07:14.520
-What have you thought out, Per-Arne?
 - Look here what it says!

48
00:07:14.680 --> 00:07:21.280
"Experience a cozy atmosphere far away from the stressful everyday life."

49
00:07:21.440 --> 00:07:28.480
"A relaxing and romantic weekend with someone you like."

50
00:07:28.640 --> 00:07:35.600
We're going there.
 We need to get away from the stressful everyday life.

51
00:07:35.760 --> 00:07:39.560
Great!
 When are we leaving?

52
00:07:41.400 --> 00:07:46.440
Now!
 I'm sure it's a weekend.

53
00:07:46.600 --> 00:07:50.600
-Oh!
 Should I bring this one?
 -Yes.

54
00:07:53.560 --> 00:07:56.440
Mm ...

55
00:07:56.600 --> 00:08:01.440
The guys have been away for a long time.
 It is getting dark.

56
00:08:01.600 --> 00:08:07.640
They are doing well.
 Magnus has a video camera so they can show what they have done.

57
00:08:11.760 --> 00:08:17.080
I am so afraid.
 I'm so terribly scared.

58
00:08:18.080 --> 00:08:21.280
We will die out here.

59
00:08:21.440 --> 00:08:26.200
--Ulf has been crazy.
 - A, cross, two ...

60
00:08:32.240 --> 00:08:36.320
Oh, Per-Arne, what you can find!

61
00:08:36.480 --> 00:08:41.720
This I call a romantic weekend!
 Cheers, Carita!

62
00:08:41.880 --> 00:08:45.000
Cheers, Per-Arne!

63
00:08:49.440 --> 00:08:54.840
- Yes ... no ... now we can this, huh?
 - Yes, now we go home.

64
00:08:55.000 --> 00:09:00.160
- I go out and start the car.
 - Yes, I lie down here.

65
00:09:11.200 --> 00:09:17.040
No, now they may come!
 I'll have dinner soon.

66
00:09:18.040 --> 00:09:21.560
-Hello.
 Now we are here.
 -Hello.

67
00:09:23.320 --> 00:09:27.560
-Hello.
 -Hello...

68
00:09:27.720 --> 00:09:32.240
- How have you had it?
 - Good, I think.

69
00:09:32.400 --> 00:09:39.240
We ... Ulf went down, but we found a dry bag, so ...

70
00:09:40.440 --> 00:09:46.920
-Good.
 Then we go and eat.
 - I would like to turn a blind eye to five minutes.

71
00:11:14.800 --> 00:11:22.720
I don't know ... A romantic weekend seems to just fortify the gender roles.

72
00:11:22.880 --> 00:11:30.160
No!
 It will be absolutely wonderful.
 Just you and me.
 No TV, no phones ...

73
00:11:30.320 --> 00:11:34.280
- No, I don't know ... - no men.

74
00:11:35.640 --> 00:11:38.640
There you have a point.

75
00:11:38.800 --> 00:11:43.960
- I love you, Robyn.
 - I love you, Leon.

76
00:12:10.960 --> 00:12:14.080
Oh, fuck!

77
00:12:16.240 --> 00:12:18.520
Gosh...

78
00:12:34.320 --> 00:12:38.480
-Hello.
 -Where have you been?

79
00:12:38.640 --> 00:12:46.720
You would have opened the door for me.
 I had a bag with me.

80
00:12:46.880 --> 00:12:51.800
- We don't do this.
 Can I take your name please?
 - Gun.

81
00:12:53.480 --> 00:12:57.280
- How was your name?
 - Yes.

82
00:12:57.440 --> 00:13:03.240
Now you have been so stupid, so now you have to make it good.

83
00:13:03.400 --> 00:13:08.200
- You can start by giving me a kiss.
 -No...

84
00:13:08.360 --> 00:13:11.960
- Give me a little kiss!
 - Room 27.

85
00:13:12.120 --> 00:13:17.000
- I can't find, Johan.
 - Anna!

86
00:13:18.760 --> 00:13:22.840
- She helps you.
 - Night ... Hello!

87
00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:29.720
What are you doing?
 I am not handicapped.
 You are crazy!

88
00:13:29.880 --> 00:13:33.240
Shouldn't you have the key?

89
00:13:36.560 --> 00:13:38.640
Crazy!

90
00:13:50.960 --> 00:13:58.480
Magnus has been promoted.
 Now he gets to work as head of department.

91
00:13:58.640 --> 00:14:04.200
Sebastian has got a new leasing car, a Toyota.
 Great!

92
00:14:04.360 --> 00:14:10.680
- He is very poppy with the manager.
 - Magnus is the manager himself.

93
00:14:10.840 --> 00:14:18.080
Sebastian refused to manager jobs for my sake - but yes to payroll.

94
00:14:19.080 --> 00:14:23.320
--Ulf has gone down part -time.
 - Yeah.

95
00:14:23.480 --> 00:14:28.560
Sebastian got an Atlas in leather from his company.

96
00:14:28.720 --> 00:14:33.680
Magnus got an Orrefors bowl.
 You will see it later.

97
00:14:35.120 --> 00:14:39.960
- Tell what I got!
 - I don't remember it.

98
00:14:40.120 --> 00:14:43.480
I got an almanac.

99
00:14:44.840 --> 00:14:50.600
Magnus took me to a conference to Hasseludden.
 Great place!

100
00:14:50.760 --> 00:14:56.080
Sebastian goes free at S.A.T.S Sports Club.

101
00:14:56.240 --> 00:14:59.240
He wanted to get in shape for my sake.

102
00:14:59.400 --> 00:15:04.960
Magnus is already so well trained.
 - I don't understand how you succeed!

103
00:15:05.120 --> 00:15:09.320
--Ulf has started with Nordic walking.
 -How fun!

104
00:15:10.320 --> 00:15:15.000
The only thing he could do after the purse ...

105
00:15:17.040 --> 00:15:24.120
You are left.
 Lucky!
 They have such strange stuff at this place.

106
00:15:24.280 --> 00:15:31.840
Saddle - Who wants to eat it?
 Especially not when it has been on a deer.

107
00:15:52.960 --> 00:15:58.520
Tonight's appetizer: Tuscan salad with arucolabed and honey roasted ...

108
00:15:58.680 --> 00:16:06.200
No no.
 We will have ribs with cooked potatoes and two large strong.

109
00:16:06.360 --> 00:16:12.000
Take in a half bend and light up the ceiling.
 Take out the rabbit food!

110
00:16:16.520 --> 00:16:19.520
Now we cuddle before the jaw comes.

111
00:16:19.680 --> 00:16:22.680
Check this out!
 Oh!

112
00:16:24.280 --> 00:16:30.280
But God, Peter!
 Don't be so grumpy because you don't have a girlfriend.

113
00:16:30.440 --> 00:16:34.080
You are the nicest of the world!

114
00:16:38.800 --> 00:16:44.680
What can such a small hand painted porcelain doll hot?

115
00:16:48.920 --> 00:16:55.120
My friend came home from Scotland yesterday.
 He brought a whiskey with him.

116
00:16:55.280 --> 00:17:01.800
I am not a whiskey must, but it was something in the horse.
 An incredible smoke flavor!

117
00:17:01.960 --> 00:17:05.000
I think it was called Glen Hockney.

118
00:17:05.160 --> 00:17:11.400
It is stupid that everyone has become such experts on malt whiskey.

119
00:17:12.680 --> 00:17:20.080
I was in Scotland last year.
 A friend cheated me into a whiskey tasting.

120
00:17:20.240 --> 00:17:28.000
We got to taste a 30 year old Loch of Frahenass.
 Totally amazing!

121
00:17:28.160 --> 00:17:32.920
There were only 100 bottles in the world.

122
00:17:33.080 --> 00:17:36.800
I'm not a whiskey guy either ...

123
00:17:36.960 --> 00:17:44.320
... but I was once at a giant - small distillery in southern Scotland.

124
00:17:44.480 --> 00:17:47.920
Glenn Hochenflochochass was called it.

125
00:17:48.080 --> 00:17:56.040
Four giant monks produced a whiskey that was so sickly smoky ...

126
00:17:57.080 --> 00:18:02.320
We had to speak Gaelic with them.

127
00:18:02.480 --> 00:18:08.560
At home I have a 300 year old Glenn Obanochnochlochloch Ulangloch.

128
00:18:08.720 --> 00:18:15.200
I bought it from two Celtic druids that have a tiny distillery.

129
00:18:15.360 --> 00:18:19.440
Only two more have been there.

130
00:18:19.600 --> 00:18:24.840
You have a blindfold when you go there.

131
00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:31.320
I was in Scotland another time too.
 Then I was abducted -

132
00:18:31.480 --> 00:18:39.160
- To a small, mysterious ... ancient little cave.

133
00:18:41.440 --> 00:18:48.800
It was below the seabed.
 They went down to it in an old submarine.

134
00:18:50.520 --> 00:18:57.680
In order for the gates to open, one had to say an old magic formula.

135
00:18:57.840 --> 00:19:04.800
Sure it's sick!
 In the cave lived an old wizard.

136
00:19:04.960 --> 00:19:08.560
Her name was ... lochoch ...

137
00:19:08.720 --> 00:19:11.840
... Hochlogsch ...

138
00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:15.760
... Glenndalhua.

139
00:19:15.920 --> 00:19:22.280
Legend says that if you pronounce her name backwards -

140
00:19:22.440 --> 00:19:27.360
- So you get caught in the cave, forever.

141
00:19:28.920 --> 00:19:33.760
- Did they make whiskey there?
 -I do not know.

142
00:19:59.200 --> 00:20:02.720
- Something who wants another beer?
 -I!

143
00:20:02.880 --> 00:20:06.560
I'll take another round.

144
00:20:06.720 --> 00:20:12.360
How wonderful to have you as friends!
 We can talk about everything.

145
00:20:12.520 --> 00:20:18.600
- We have been given such a close relationship.
 - It's cool with this vicinity!

146
00:20:18.760 --> 00:20:26.440
I can put your arm around you, Frida.
 - And you don't take it badly, Magnus.

147
00:20:26.600 --> 00:20:32.880
- What a lot of fun we have done together!
 - We haven't done everything you can do.

148
00:20:33.040 --> 00:20:35.680
No...

149
00:20:36.880 --> 00:20:41.720
There are many exciting things to try ...

150
00:20:42.920 --> 00:20:46.600
-...to do.
 - Fun with this weekend!

151
00:20:46.760 --> 00:20:51.040
- Correct with relaxation!
 - Revision is content.

152
00:20:51.200 --> 00:20:54.680
One should not be afraid to change.

153
00:20:55.680 --> 00:20:58.320
Gosh...

154
00:20:59.320 --> 00:21:05.360
For example, say that I eat brown beans every day ...

155
00:21:05.520 --> 00:21:13.040
It's delicious with brown beans, but say I have to eat them every day.

156
00:21:13.200 --> 00:21:19.400
Then it is clear that I am curious about how other food tastes.

157
00:21:21.120 --> 00:21:27.000
And Magnus eats lobster every day.
 He may be tired of it.

158
00:21:27.160 --> 00:21:33.000
If I get to try your lobster you get to taste my brown beans.

159
00:21:33.160 --> 00:21:37.160
- For the sake of change ... - what do you want to say?

160
00:21:37.320 --> 00:21:42.360
We can be natural and free with each other.

161
00:21:42.520 --> 00:21:48.760
If I massage Frida, then you don't think it's hard.

162
00:21:48.920 --> 00:21:52.400
You can do the same on Kristina.

163
00:21:53.560 --> 00:21:57.360
- Kristina has gone now.
 - Yeah.

164
00:21:57.520 --> 00:22:03.360
- She would call a taxi.
 - We will go to bed now.

165
00:22:03.520 --> 00:22:08.480
It has been a long day.
 Thank you and good evening.

166
00:22:08.640 --> 00:22:11.000
Good night.

167
00:22:16.720 --> 00:22:20.200
It's just you and me, Jenny.

168
00:22:24.640 --> 00:22:27.920
- Should you order anything?
 -Yes.

169
00:22:28.080 --> 00:22:31.240
-What then?
 -A few beers.

170
00:22:31.400 --> 00:22:34.800
It's a carladae, it!

171
00:22:34.960 --> 00:22:38.760
- You are happy today.
 -Yes...

172
00:22:38.920 --> 00:22:44.040
Do you know how to say "happy" in Danish?

173
00:22:44.200 --> 00:22:47.360
-No.
 -Horny.

174
00:22:47.520 --> 00:22:52.520
It is spelled with "D", so in Danish you are "resistant" today.

175
00:22:53.840 --> 00:22:56.240
Hello!

176
00:22:56.400 --> 00:23:03.000
Do you know what the Danish says when something has gone wrong?
 It's cock in the machinery.

177
00:23:05.280 --> 00:23:11.360
When you are horny you do not want the cock there, but in a nicer place.

178
00:23:13.400 --> 00:23:20.720
-Hello!
 If you get no help here ... - Follow with me in the room!

179
00:23:20.880 --> 00:23:25.680
-No thanks.
 - Did you know what that means in Danish?

180
00:23:25.840 --> 00:23:31.160
"I want you, Gun!"
 Then I say: "The store is open!"

181
00:23:31.320 --> 00:23:34.680
Come here!
 Hello!

182
00:23:38.000 --> 00:23:41.600
That you can never be at peace!

183
00:23:44.040 --> 00:23:48.880
If I sit with you, don't you take up badly?

184
00:23:49.040 --> 00:23:52.120
I sit here with you.

185
00:23:55.680 --> 00:24:00.680
If I put your arm if you don't take up badly?

186
00:24:03.280 --> 00:24:08.240
- I have tear gas spray in my bag.
 - Yeah.

187
00:24:46.640 --> 00:24:51.760
- It was time for cleaning.
 - half one at night?

188
00:24:51.920 --> 00:24:55.520
Here we clean at night.

189
00:24:56.520 --> 00:25:02.160
- I don't want any cleaning.
 - Then you get fined.

190
00:25:02.320 --> 00:25:09.440
It is high fines if you do not receive the cleaning - SEK 675.

191
00:25:09.600 --> 00:25:15.480
- Fan ... How long does it take?
 - It only takes ten minutes.

192
00:25:15.640 --> 00:25:18.680
Yes, yes ... Join, then.

193
00:25:29.360 --> 00:25:32.360
Ringtone

194
00:25:35.040 --> 00:25:39.040
- It's Gert here.
 - Is that reception?

195
00:25:39.200 --> 00:25:43.320
I'd like a wake up call.

196
00:25:43.480 --> 00:25:47.240
Aren't you awake?

197
00:25:47.400 --> 00:25:50.440
Are you talking in your sleep, now?

198
00:25:50.600 --> 00:25:54.720
- Can I order wake up from you?
 - Sleeping!

199
00:25:54.880 --> 00:25:58.760
Can't you take my order?

200
00:25:58.920 --> 00:26:01.920
- Bu!
 -Hello?

201
00:26:02.080 --> 00:26:05.200
There I woke you up, you!

202
00:26:11.040 --> 00:26:14.560
Don't you bother the other guests?

203
00:26:14.720 --> 00:26:19.760
No, I'll just look at the bed a little.

204
00:26:21.080 --> 00:26:24.440
You do not usually clean in the middle of the night.

205
00:26:24.600 --> 00:26:29.960
- I just have to clean up here ... - what are you doing?

206
00:26:32.560 --> 00:26:38.280
- So you can come ... - you are not a real maid!

207
00:26:38.440 --> 00:26:41.520
Go out, for fucking!

208
00:26:41.680 --> 00:26:47.520
You don't say no to a neighboring woman!
 Come now!

209
00:26:47.680 --> 00:26:51.680
Come ... Hello!
 Hello!

210
00:26:52.840 --> 00:26:56.960
-Help!
 -Come back!

211
00:26:57.120 --> 00:27:01.000
So!
 Release!
 Come now!

212
00:27:01.160 --> 00:27:04.160
What is it about?

213
00:27:05.520 --> 00:27:11.000
He took the dust lash and tried to get me into the room.

214
00:27:12.520 --> 00:27:18.720
-I'm shocked.
 - Help her into the room.

215
00:27:21.200 --> 00:27:23.960
There you are...

216
00:27:24.120 --> 00:27:27.560
Then maybe you can get the puzzle now?

217
00:27:57.200 --> 00:28:00.200

218
00:28:03.840 --> 00:28:11.480
This is life, Peter!
 Be out in the countryside and breathe healthy country air!

219
00:28:17.120 --> 00:28:19.120
Great!
