My name is Krister Hertting and I am project manager for Hilf-

2
00:00:18,933 --> 00:00:23,433
-A project on immigrated women's health and way into Swedish society.

3
00:00:23,433 --> 00:00:27,267
A sub-project within the high school's focus area health innovation-

4
00:00:27,267 --> 00:00:32,100
-Focusing on women's path into leadership in the Swedish sports movement.

5
00:00:32,100 --> 00:00:36,533
The project helps to find strategies that help sports to greater diversity.

6
00:00:36,533 --> 00:00:40,733
We take a trip in the elevator and I'll tell you more.

7
00:00:42,533 --> 00:00:46,067
Many children and young people participate in Swedish association sports, but girls with-

8
00:00:46,067 --> 00:00:49,333
-Informer background is the group that participates at the very least.

9
00:00:49,333 --> 00:00:52,367
The representation is also oblique within the leadership.

10
00:00:52,367 --> 00:00:56,100
Generally, more men than women are leaders and-

11
00:00:56,100 --> 00:00:59,267
-Ist represented are women with an immigrant background.

12
00:00:59,267 --> 00:01:03,433
Therefore, a challenge for the sports movement will be to increase the diversity of leadership.

13
00:01:03,500 --> 00:01:07,667
In an ongoing research project we interviewed immigrated women-

14
00:01:07,800 --> 00:01:11,967
-If their experience of how they got into leadership positions in Swedish sports.

15
00:01:12,533 --> 00:01:15,633
The results show that many women had a strong inner drive-

16
00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:18,600
-Va Ã¤ve personal meetings and any special person who supported-

17
00:01:18,680 --> 00:01:22,240
-played a big role, sometimes even through contacts and activities at-

18
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:25,800
-For example, refugee homes.
 But the results show above all-

19
00:01:25,880 --> 00:01:30,360
-Th the need for purposeful strategies to recruit and retain-

20
00:01:30,433 --> 00:01:34,167
-Immigrated women in sports leadership.

21
00:01:34,167 --> 00:01:40,367
