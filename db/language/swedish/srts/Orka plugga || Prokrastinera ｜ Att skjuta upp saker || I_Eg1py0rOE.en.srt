1
00:00:00,760 --> 00:00:04,480
Everyone is postponing things.
 Sometimes we need it.

2
00:00:04,640 --> 00:00:10,080
When we postpone something even though we know it gets negative consequences-

3
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:12,120
-Then we procrastinate.

4
00:00:12,280 --> 00:00:17,200
It might be that you postpone to plug because you don't cope-

5
00:00:17,360 --> 00:00:19,920
-Fast you have less time tomorrow-

6
00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:23,960
-and won't be able to plug so much.

7
00:00:24,120 --> 00:00:27,640
We let short-term benefits control-

8
00:00:27,800 --> 00:00:33,760
-Sagare than thinking in the long term and seeing the benefits of grabbing things.

9
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:38,360
Identify your designs and excuses.

10
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:43,960
I'm too tired right now.
 I read the text when I'm in the right mood.

11
00:00:44,120 --> 00:00:48,320
I still work better under pressure.
 I'm just gonna...

12
00:00:49,720 --> 00:00:51,400
Overlook.

13
00:00:51,560 --> 00:00:57,080
One reason we postpone something is because it feels too big.

14
00:00:57,240 --> 00:01:00,400
Divide what you should do into different parts.

15
00:01:00,560 --> 00:01:04,800
If you are going to count math, start with a page in the math book-

16
00:01:04,960 --> 00:01:07,680
-or maybe a dozen.

17
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:10,120
Plan and create structure.

18
00:01:10,280 --> 00:01:14,480
Plan in when you are going to plug, but even when you are free.

19
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:20,480
Rather plan shorter plug passes and allow yourself to take breaks.

20
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:24,200
If you plan in too much, the discomfort may increase-

21
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:28,480
-Then you might continue to postpone it.

22
00:01:29,960 --> 00:01:32,400
Learn to live with the discomfort.

23
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:38,800
It's not always fun to plug.
 We are good at finding on excuses-

24
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:44,520
-But you can plug when you are not motivated or when it is hard.

25
00:01:44,680 --> 00:01:46,760
Five minutes.

26
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:51,760
If you notice that you are postponing a task, give it five minutes.

27
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:55,360
Maybe it loosens it and you can complete it.

28
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:58,400
Otherwise, spend five minutes again later.

29
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:02,720
To be satisfied.
 Sometimes it is enough with "good enough".

30
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:06,800
Too high demands can lead to us not taking hold of homework.

31
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:12,560
Everything doesn't always have to be perfect.
 Sometimes it is good to lower the bar.

32
00:02:13,640 --> 00:02:17,760
Plug with a friend.
 If you have determined time with some-

33
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:21,360
-Is the probability greater that you plug-

34
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:24,480
-and don't postpone it.

35
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:29,920
Reward you.
 There can be small rewards.

36
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:34,840
You can reward yourself by seeing the latest episode of a Series-

37
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:39,560
-When you have clearly written the first pages of the task.

38
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:45,800
Sometimes we have to postpone things, but try to withstand short-term advantage-

39
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:51,160
-and try to think long term.
 What do I win the most?
