00:00:00,340 --> 00:00:02,340
Hello

2
00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:06,540
Hope you've had a great weekend

3
00:00:08,140 --> 00:00:11,320
And here's a little tip

4
00:00:12,440 --> 00:00:14,440
On how you can work out

5
00:00:14,440 --> 00:00:16,040
And repeat

6
00:00:16,860 --> 00:00:20,300
In a simple but very good way

7
00:00:20,420 --> 00:00:23,260
and that is to

8
00:00:24,660 --> 00:00:27,860
Teach out something you can

9
00:00:27,860 --> 00:00:29,420
to a friend

10
00:00:30,060 --> 00:00:32,060
or

11
00:00:32,280 --> 00:00:34,280
Repeat something

12
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:37,520
As you have just learned

13
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:39,440
by

14
00:00:39,880 --> 00:00:42,740
Explain the same thing to a friend

15
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:45,680
It may be in school

16
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:48,480
or it might be in your family

17
00:00:50,140 --> 00:00:52,140
It can be anyone

18
00:00:52,680 --> 00:00:54,680
who also trains Swedish

19
00:00:55,700 --> 00:00:57,700
so

20
00:00:58,580 --> 00:01:00,580
One way is to

21
00:01:01,700 --> 00:01:05,400
If you study Swedish together with a friend

22
00:01:05,980 --> 00:01:07,980
So you can

23
00:01:08,520 --> 00:01:12,000
decide that you are looking at each one

24
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:14,400
So different

25
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:16,300
Movies

26
00:01:16,980 --> 00:01:18,980
about anything on youtube

27
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:21,600
For example, it may be

28
00:01:22,440 --> 00:01:25,620
Someone who explains something about Swedish grammar

29
00:01:27,080 --> 00:01:31,320
So you are watching two movies, two different movies

30
00:01:32,540 --> 00:01:36,100
and maybe notes, writes a little

31
00:01:37,260 --> 00:01:40,360
Then you will explain to each other

32
00:01:44,020 --> 00:01:46,020
You should explain what your movie is all about

33
00:01:47,780 --> 00:01:49,780
And this is a great way to ...

34
00:01:49,780 --> 00:01:51,620
Then you must first

35
00:01:52,620 --> 00:01:55,820
strain yourself and be sure

36
00:01:55,820 --> 00:01:57,740
that you understand

37
00:01:58,160 --> 00:02:00,160
what is the movie about

38
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:02,600
and then

39
00:02:03,460 --> 00:02:06,100
So when you explain to your buddy

40
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:08,680
so it becomes both to

41
00:02:08,680 --> 00:02:10,540
You repeat

42
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:16,200
and you have to think about and make it clear to yourself

43
00:02:16,940 --> 00:02:19,540
what it was the movie was about

44
00:02:19,900 --> 00:02:22,640
what it was you just learned

45
00:02:23,940 --> 00:02:27,720
Of course it works just as well if

46
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:30,840
you go to a lesson at school

47
00:02:31,660 --> 00:02:33,660
But your buddy is not there

48
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:38,060
So take ten, fifteen minutes

49
00:02:38,060 --> 00:02:39,900
next time you meet

50
00:02:39,900 --> 00:02:41,840
and explain

51
00:02:42,520 --> 00:02:44,520
the most important thing from the lesson or

52
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:46,680
just choose one thing

53
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:50,480
Choose a few words, choose some grammar

54
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:55,720
and show, explain, tell

55
00:02:57,320 --> 00:02:59,320
It can also just be words

56
00:03:00,300 --> 00:03:03,180
You can decide to learn

57
00:03:03,180 --> 00:03:05,020
Ten new words

58
00:03:05,900 --> 00:03:07,900
within a particular area

59
00:03:08,240 --> 00:03:10,240
If a particular subject

60
00:03:11,260 --> 00:03:13,860
and then you teach your friend these words

61
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:19,140
Then it will also be easier for you to remember them.

62
00:03:19,140 --> 00:03:20,960
and use the words

63
00:03:22,380 --> 00:03:24,380
so...

64
00:03:24,780 --> 00:03:27,560
Learn each other!
 Help each other!

65
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:29,640
and

66
00:03:29,900 --> 00:03:31,900
so you at the same time help yourself

67
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:35,200
It's Sunday's tips

68
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:38,620
And I hope you have a good week

69
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:42,520
and trains a lot of Swedish

70
00:03:42,900 --> 00:03:44,900
Have a good one!
 Bye.
