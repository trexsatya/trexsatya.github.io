1
00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:39.880
Welcome to shrimp frozen!

2
00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:46.640
We will visit a vineyard in Provence and look at the spring fashion in Milan ...

3
00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:52.680
... and go on a art walk around Millesgården.
 No, we were just kidding!

4
00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:58.560
For those of you who want to know more about us, we have invested in new technology.

5
00:00:58.720 --> 00:01:02.200
We have acquired our own overhead page.

6
00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:08.880
On it you can write down information that you post on the wall.

7
00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:15.880
Imagine what the overhead will mean for the distance work!

8
00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:22.800
- But it's technically vulnerable.
 - If the lamp hits then you stand there.

9
00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:30.960
- On the overhead page you can read about us.
 - I act as a stand -up comedian.

10
00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:38.360
I think it is important to meet everyone in the audience as an artist ...

11
00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:43.240
Then my unique talent comes to its right.

12
00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:52.360
Hello!
 Welcome here to my barbecue kiosk!

13
00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:59.360
My ladies and gentlemen, directly from the TV: stand up comedian David!

14
00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:03.720
Have you thought about this with sausages?

15
00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:18.520
There are cooked sausages, narrow sausages and long and thick.

16
00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:25.880
It's crazy!
 HA!
 After all, it's totally snappy.
 And the sausages have skins!

17
00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:33.240
How can the sausages have skins?
 Are they sunbathing?
 "Oh, it's hot, give me ketchup!"

18
00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:39.800
And the skin just bursts: "Oh, I'm sweating, I'm a big sausage."

19
00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:45.920
It's fun to see so many people here.
 - What do you work with?

20
00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:53.880
Ami has a sale on the leafy piece today - SEK 29 including strips and middle drinks.

21
00:02:54.880 --> 00:03:00.000
It might be tough last half hour but it felt good!

22
00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:10.800
We will introduce a new program point for guys: Now it will be a boy!

23
00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:17.880
Tonight we will talk sports.

24
00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:24.600
- We guys love sports.
 - Girls like more animals and stuff.

25
00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:31.200
- Yes, horses, skin creams and stuff.
 - But we guys like sports.

26
00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:36.920
- You don't coward for strong beer, huh?
 - No, it will be good.

27
00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:42.560
- I love strong beer.
 Now we bowl.
 -Bowl!

28
00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:52.480
-Strong!
 - Yes, it bubbles in the nose.

29
00:03:53.480 --> 00:03:57.600
- Chips, maybe?
 - Yes, nice.

30
00:03:58.600 --> 00:04:04.920
-Delicious!
 And I've done quiche.
 - Oh, pie!
 I love pie.

31
00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:11.720
Surely it is fun with football?
 Hammarby is my favorite team.

32
00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:16.880
- So you like Gnaget?
 - I've always been rodents.

33
00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:24.800
I like Helsingborg best.
 They are best at fit and dribble.

34
00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:30.080
- They have one who is good at dribbling.
 - A dark guy?

35
00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:33.640
Yes, he can dribble!

36
00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:39.680
- I don't like Helsingborg's clothes.
 - No, green does not fit white.

37
00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:45.880
- No, it's probably Hammarby.
 - I always mix them two.

38
00:04:46.040 --> 00:04:49.400
We will look at a nice goal.

39
00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:55.080
NO!

40
00:04:57.080 --> 00:05:02.240
--Wow, what a goal!
 - Yeah!
 Straight into the bar!

41
00:05:04.200 --> 00:05:09.280
- Turn out that it wasn't offside.
 - I hate offside!

42
00:05:09.440 --> 00:05:14.040
- Why are you shooting offside?
 - Shoot in goal instead!

43
00:05:14.200 --> 00:05:18.640
- Should you have snuff?
 - Yes, I love snuff!

44
00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:24.640
It is with licorice flavor, huh?
 Oh, what a good thing about snuff!

45
00:05:24.800 --> 00:05:28.800
- More strong beer?
 - No, I got spinning.

46
00:05:28.960 --> 00:05:31.960
Handball is also fun.

47
00:05:32.120 --> 00:05:38.560
10 minutes left and it says 2–2 ... How will it go?
 you think.

48
00:05:38.720 --> 00:05:44.000
And when they score goals, they remain in the ring.

49
00:05:46.960 --> 00:05:52.800
- I start to feel bad about the snuff.
 - We will end the boy talk for today.

50
00:05:52.960 --> 00:05:57.680
Next week we will tip about good video films.

51
00:05:57.840 --> 00:06:02.080
I will review "fried, green tomatoes".

52
00:06:02.240 --> 00:06:05.320
And I have seen "flowers of steel".

53
00:06:09.480 --> 00:06:15.240
It's time for close by.
 Tonight's guest: Arne Weise.

54
00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:27.880
Arne?
 What is your best school subject?

55
00:06:28.880 --> 00:06:31.880
Slant.

56
00:06:32.040 --> 00:06:36.840
- Do you have any middle name?
 -Yes I have.

57
00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:42.000
Arne Georg Fredrik Filippo Gustavo Stina.

58
00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:48.560
- Have you had a beard ever?
 - Yes, but not on the face.

59
00:06:51.680 --> 00:06:57.360
Which is the strangest place you have vomited?

60
00:06:57.520 --> 00:07:02.080
I vomit every morning.
 Everyone does.

61
00:07:03.080 --> 00:07:08.520
- What animals do you think is ugliest?
 - I hate animals!

62
00:07:12.360 --> 00:07:16.360
Ugliest?
 Everyone is ugly, I think.

63
00:07:17.840 --> 00:07:21.640
Arne, do you have a touge?

64
00:07:21.800 --> 00:07:26.880
Which one do you choose - string or boxer?

65
00:07:27.040 --> 00:07:31.120
I prefer a dachshund or gray dog.

66
00:07:32.120 --> 00:07:35.120
Thanks for coming here!

67
00:07:37.560 --> 00:07:40.360
Thanks, Mona!

68
00:07:40.520 --> 00:07:46.240
It is not easy to be a single mom and waitress.

69
00:07:46.400 --> 00:07:51.800
In that profession, many dangers deceive.
 - Be so good, next!

70
00:07:56.120 --> 00:08:01.600
- I am called Kennet and is an alcoholic.
 - Hi, Kennet!

71
00:08:03.160 --> 00:08:07.640
I have worked as a traveling seller.

72
00:08:07.800 --> 00:08:13.800
After work I started sitting in the hotel bar and having some drinks.

73
00:08:13.960 --> 00:08:21.200
It became more and more.
 Then I realized that I needed help.
 Sörpling

74
00:08:21.360 --> 00:08:27.800
Måns, your attitude to this treatment does not seem serious!

75
00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:35.000
Where have you been this weekend, Johan?

76
00:08:35.160 --> 00:08:40.120
In meeting with gluten allergies.

77
00:08:40.280 --> 00:08:45.360
- Are you allergic?
 - No, but it's fun to meet people.

78
00:08:47.120 --> 00:08:51.960
We talk and jaw gluten -free bread.

79
00:08:52.120 --> 00:08:57.760
- You are an association person?
 - I think you should activate yourself.

80
00:08:57.920 --> 00:09:01.760
I have joined a new association.

81
00:09:01.920 --> 00:09:07.040
A bunch of guys who meet out in the woods and talk.

82
00:09:07.200 --> 00:09:12.320
- Rotary?
 - No, but it's conservative.

83
00:09:12.480 --> 00:09:16.600
-What's your name?
 -It's a secret.

84
00:09:16.760 --> 00:09:23.040
- Are you a sect, right?
 - No, but we have white marks on us.

85
00:09:24.040 --> 00:09:28.040
- Is it religious?
 -Yes...

86
00:09:28.200 --> 00:09:34.440
We have different activities.
 This weekend we are going to a refugee camp.

87
00:09:34.600 --> 00:09:41.720
I think it will be interesting to see how other cultures are doing.

88
00:09:41.880 --> 00:09:49.840
I have the program for next week.
 Here we stand out on rafting.

89
00:09:51.840 --> 00:09:55.920
Cross burning is this.

90
00:09:57.360 --> 00:10:02.000
Well.
 Yes, there is always something!

91
00:10:02.160 --> 00:10:07.320
- We are going to a mosque and lunch.
 -Lynch.

92
00:10:09.080 --> 00:10:13.080
- Yeah.
 Yes Yes!
 - It seems fun.

93
00:10:13.240 --> 00:10:17.400
- You can certainly keep up.
 -Do you think so?

94
00:10:17.560 --> 00:10:23.240
They have some tricky rules but if you come with me so ...

95
00:10:23.400 --> 00:10:26.400
... can you talk to me.

96
00:10:39.200 --> 00:10:42.920
Welcome to the garden corner again!

97
00:10:43.080 --> 00:10:49.760
Last week we talked about hedge plants - boxwood and leagues.

98
00:10:49.920 --> 00:10:55.000
We also talked about planting distance -

99
00:10:55.160 --> 00:10:59.320
- And I tried to cut.

100
00:10:59.480 --> 00:11:07.560
We have received nice letters.
 One is from Bertil Magnvik from Tyresö-

101
00:11:07.720 --> 00:11:12.680
- As he writes that he was missing Tuja.

102
00:11:12.840 --> 00:11:20.080
"Well -groomed tuja hedges always give a noble impression to a garden."

103
00:11:20.240 --> 00:11:26.440
"The dark green cones of the tujas give a full -bodied greenery and good lushness."

104
00:11:26.600 --> 00:11:32.640
He also sends a photo on his own tuja hedge.

105
00:11:32.800 --> 00:11:38.720
It is a magnificent copy that is manually cut.

106
00:11:38.880 --> 00:11:46.800
It's just to congratulate Bertil on the success of his tuja hedge.

107
00:11:46.960 --> 00:11:54.880
He also thinks I was very professional in my molding.

108
00:11:55.040 --> 00:12:02.160
It was probably jokingly said, but I thank you for that praise.

109
00:12:02.320 --> 00:12:07.640
But we're not going to suck each other's cocks yet -

110
00:12:07.800 --> 00:12:13.880
- Look at our fine boxwood - it has received aphids lately!

111
00:12:14.040 --> 00:12:20.400
You have to be careful even if they are very resistant.

112
00:12:20.560 --> 00:12:28.160
This about this.
 Now we will see an element that is about composting.

113
00:12:30.040 --> 00:12:36.160
-Bullseye!
 - Yes, but don't say "suck each other".

114
00:12:37.160 --> 00:12:41.400
-No?
 - It feels a little too strong.

115
00:12:41.560 --> 00:12:47.280
Well.
 Maybe I should say "praise each other"?

116
00:12:47.440 --> 00:12:52.120
- Yes, we drive it instead.
 -Okay.

117
00:12:56.080 --> 00:12:59.320
We will be given food for the soul.

118
00:12:59.480 --> 00:13:06.720
In 3 minutes a week you get a better life!
 Lifecoach Henrik Elmér!

119
00:13:10.760 --> 00:13:17.680
Thanks so much!
 Welcome once again to the course "Meet Life with Henrik".

120
00:13:17.840 --> 00:13:23.320
This is how you make a boring situation more fun.

121
00:13:23.480 --> 00:13:28.240
One way to gild life is the pig game.

122
00:13:28.400 --> 00:13:34.800
You have a teacup that is cut and oblong with two dots in the bottom.

123
00:13:34.960 --> 00:13:38.120
When you drink you are similar to a pig.

124
00:13:38.280 --> 00:13:46.120
It's fun to invite a friend to tea.
 When he drinks I sound: grunts

125
00:13:47.120 --> 00:13:52.360
Then it will be fun to invite friends home.

126
00:13:52.520 --> 00:13:59.800
I'll show one thing.
 I've told you about Gunilla that I was with.

127
00:13:59.960 --> 00:14:07.120
Maybe someone is curious about her.
 Here I have a photo of her.

128
00:14:08.120 --> 00:14:13.960
Nämen Hello, Gunilla!
 How are you today?
 Ha, ha, ha, ha!

129
00:14:19.720 --> 00:14:23.880
- Henrik, what is this?
 - It's pork - Gunilla.

130
00:14:24.040 --> 00:14:31.360
- Henrik - the bed ... are you sleeping here?
 - Yes, but it's just temporary.

131
00:14:32.520 --> 00:14:39.640
- You can't sleep here at the theater.
 -I must!
 I dare not live at home.

132
00:14:39.800 --> 00:14:46.600
There is a madman in my staircase.
 He's totally crazy!

133
00:14:47.600 --> 00:14:53.640
A while ago, the madman started putting stuff in my mailbox.

134
00:14:53.800 --> 00:14:59.640
It looked like regular letters from the bank and Säpo eg.

135
00:14:59.800 --> 00:15:06.360
I realized that it must be from someone in the house because the gate is locked.

136
00:15:06.520 --> 00:15:12.560
The worst thing was when there were letters that seemed to be from my mom.

137
00:15:12.720 --> 00:15:19.440
This madman had written long letters with my mother's writing.

138
00:15:19.600 --> 00:15:25.520
It was nasty and I wanted to know which of my neighbors it was.

139
00:15:25.680 --> 00:15:31.520
So always when I met someone in the stairwell I said, "Hi, Mom!"

140
00:15:32.520 --> 00:15:38.520
To see who looked guilty.
 But everyone looked guilty.

141
00:15:38.680 --> 00:15:45.640
Everyone looked like they thought, "Has he taken?"
 I expected a plot:

142
00:15:45.800 --> 00:15:50.840
That all my neighbors made letters in my mailbox.

143
00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:57.760
But then I heard two of my neighbors talk about the madman in the house.

144
00:15:59.800 --> 00:16:04.280
They also had problems with the madman.

145
00:16:04.440 --> 00:16:11.760
Then we decided that I will live somewhere else until "psychot" has moved

146
00:16:11.920 --> 00:16:19.800
One solution is to live here and the course is about finding solutions.

147
00:16:19.960 --> 00:16:24.880
Next week you will know more.
 Thanks!

148
00:16:25.880 --> 00:16:33.880
Let us pray.
 Father spring who is in heaven, sanctified was your name ...

149
00:16:34.040 --> 00:16:37.320
Sörpling

150
00:16:38.320 --> 00:16:43.600
Do your will, such as in heaven, as well as on earth.
 Sörpling

151
00:16:43.760 --> 00:16:47.560
-Sch!
 -Sch!

152
00:16:53.280 --> 00:16:57.280
- Do you use good deeds?
 -Yes.

153
00:16:57.440 --> 00:17:02.240
Last week I cut the neighbor's hedge.

154
00:17:04.960 --> 00:17:08.040
Mm, that's good.

155
00:17:08.200 --> 00:17:14.040
We chose this joke as the winner from the contributions to our joke competition.

156
00:17:14.200 --> 00:17:19.880
The winner is Ulf Buller in Höör.
 A piece of the Berlin Wall is on the way.

157
00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:25.200
Coughs

158
00:17:25.360 --> 00:17:29.560
-Cold?
 - It's probably the flu.

159
00:17:29.720 --> 00:17:33.640
It goes a lot like that now.

160
00:17:33.800 --> 00:17:41.800
I went home from work.
 I was going to rest, watch video and drink hot.

161
00:17:41.960 --> 00:17:46.840
-Just right!
 Customer number?
 –2154.

162
00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:53.360
So there.
 You should see "the plane's planet", I see.
 It's a real classic!

163
00:17:53.520 --> 00:17:58.600
- Have you seen it before?
 -No.

164
00:17:59.600 --> 00:18:06.840
You are deceived by it is called "The plane of the monkeys".
 They are on earth all the time.

165
00:18:07.840 --> 00:18:13.200
Did you know that?
 You don't understand it until the last scene -

166
00:18:13.360 --> 00:18:19.880
- When you see the goddess of liberty sticking out of the sand.
 Then you are surprised.

167
00:18:20.040 --> 00:18:23.440
Get well!
 Hello!

168
00:18:26.680 --> 00:18:33.720
As on his student album ... Everyone came in and he said "Where is the camel?"

169
00:18:33.880 --> 00:18:38.680
- "Has anyone seen my camel?"
 -Good God!

170
00:18:38.840 --> 00:18:43.920
- I have to work.
 -Nice to see you.

171
00:18:44.080 --> 00:18:49.880
We have to redo this!
 Should we take a pilsner this weekend?

172
00:18:50.040 --> 00:18:53.600
Yes, I'll call you on Friday.

173
00:18:55.560 --> 00:18:59.760
- Tapped something?
 - The wallet.
 Have you seen it?

174
00:18:59.920 --> 00:19:05.280
-No.
 Did you have it with you?
 - Yes, I paid the coffee.

175
00:19:05.440 --> 00:19:10.840
- Have you forgotten it on the toilet?
 - No, I haven't been there.

176
00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:15.800
- You haven't stopped it?
 -No.

177
00:19:16.800 --> 00:19:22.440
Here it is!
 It's my wallet - I see that.

178
00:19:22.600 --> 00:19:27.760
- No, that's mine.
 - No, that's my driver's license here.

179
00:19:27.920 --> 00:19:31.160
Okay.
 Wrong by me.

180
00:19:31.320 --> 00:19:37.080
What is this?
 I had 500 bucks.
 Where are they?

181
00:19:37.240 --> 00:19:42.240
- You paid for the coffee.
 –25 bucks, yes.

182
00:19:43.360 --> 00:19:46.720
Have you taken them?

183
00:19:46.880 --> 00:19:53.200
How long have we known each other?
 I am one of your best friends.

184
00:19:53.360 --> 00:19:59.560
Would I steal SEK 500 and hide them in my stocking?

185
00:20:02.520 --> 00:20:06.640
Ah, I took a robber!
 I took a chance!

186
00:20:07.640 --> 00:20:12.680
Here you have the money.
 I had to test.

187
00:20:12.840 --> 00:20:17.480
Now we will start to be seen regularly!

188
00:20:20.680 --> 00:20:28.280
We'll talk about death.
 I'm not afraid of death because I'm semi -Indian.

189
00:20:28.440 --> 00:20:35.840
In India you do not die, but you become a cow, rat or something in that style.

190
00:20:36.000 --> 00:20:44.280
You can drive past a Scanian cow and think, "I recognize him!"

191
00:20:44.440 --> 00:20:49.880
We will look at my past lives.
 I have a pedigree here.

192
00:20:50.040 --> 00:20:56.560
2,000 years ago I was a manager to Jesus.
 Booked him at Gig.

193
00:20:56.720 --> 00:21:01.200
He often said, "Too badly paid!"

194
00:21:01.360 --> 00:21:05.680
When we were to make the sermon, I had to chat:

195
00:21:05.840 --> 00:21:13.440
"Come on now, Jesus! Everyone will see you, people from the Bible get there."

196
00:21:14.440 --> 00:21:20.400
Then I booked him out at the taverns as guest - Bartender.

197
00:21:20.560 --> 00:21:27.800
The trick when he made water for wine was brilliant!
 But he was tedious.

198
00:21:27.960 --> 00:21:34.160
I said, "Don't dress like a hippie! Sandals had before Christ."

199
00:21:34.320 --> 00:21:41.640
Look at Judas - he can talk to people!
 He comes in everywhere.

200
00:21:42.640 --> 00:21:48.680
I have also been a PR consultant for Kristian Tyrann -

201
00:21:48.840 --> 00:21:56.200
- The Kazakhstan in the 1800s and a dental hygienist for Martin Luther.

202
00:21:56.360 --> 00:22:00.840
Most recently, I was a plumbing installer in Trelleborg.

203
00:22:01.000 --> 00:22:07.240
Dear audience!
 I am now going to recall one of my past lives.

204
00:22:17.680 --> 00:22:23.720
- Does this take a long time?
 - People like this, it's good TV.

205
00:22:27.880 --> 00:22:33.040
David has been moved to a previous life.

206
00:22:33.200 --> 00:22:39.200
He has become Gert Håkansson, plumbing installer from Trelleborg.

207
00:22:39.360 --> 00:22:44.040
- Welcome here, Gert!
 - It's good to be here.

208
00:22:44.200 --> 00:22:48.440
Yes, Gert ...

209
00:22:48.600 --> 00:22:51.640
... what is it like to be a plumbing installer?

210
00:22:51.800 --> 00:22:56.200
I'm ... I'm not full, you!

211
00:22:57.400 --> 00:23:02.400
There is a lot of work down in the basement, up and down.

212
00:23:02.560 --> 00:23:07.880
And as I usually say: it doesn't smell roses there!

213
00:23:08.040 --> 00:23:13.200
It's like onions on the salmon you could say.

214
00:23:13.360 --> 00:23:18.320
- Onion on the salmon.
 - Onion on the salmon.

215
00:23:18.480 --> 00:23:23.120
- You are early retired?
 - Yes, it was ...

216
00:23:23.280 --> 00:23:30.040
They said, "We'll put you on Hispan, Gert. You're going to Hospital."

217
00:23:30.200 --> 00:23:37.480
It was gin and genever.
 It was both Gin and Genever and Snaps!

218
00:23:38.480 --> 00:23:46.520
My wife stuck, you.
 I said, "Stick, you! I can't cope with you anymore!"

219
00:23:46.680 --> 00:23:53.880
She stuck with Gunnar.
 I went home to him and pissed in the hammock.

220
00:23:54.040 --> 00:23:58.040
- Thanks for coming here, Gert!
 -Thank you!

221
00:24:01.840 --> 00:24:05.840
Yes ... Tommy was a good guy.

222
00:24:06.840 --> 00:24:13.720
He left his wife Monika and their dog Rocky.

223
00:24:13.880 --> 00:24:19.800
Well, I couldn't imagine that the band saw was so dangerous.

224
00:24:19.960 --> 00:24:24.280
We honor Tommy with a silent minute.

225
00:24:29.840 --> 00:24:33.600
Sörpling

226
00:24:40.920 --> 00:24:48.240
We will talk about modern working life with debater Kerstin Bäck

227
00:24:49.680 --> 00:24:53.120
Welcome!

228
00:24:53.280 --> 00:24:58.720
You have worked as a traverse driver at a steel mill.

229
00:24:58.880 --> 00:25:01.960
Now you travel around and lecture.

230
00:25:02.120 --> 00:25:07.800
What is the most important message you want to convey?

231
00:25:08.800 --> 00:25:12.960
A lot has happened in working life.

232
00:25:13.120 --> 00:25:19.160
The women still have the lowest salary and there are few female managers ...

233
00:25:19.320 --> 00:25:22.680
I'm not full, you!

234
00:25:24.280 --> 00:25:27.400
I am nail soils!

235
00:25:27.560 --> 00:25:31.000
The development has not progressed?

236
00:25:31.160 --> 00:25:38.640
- I usually encourage women to ... - Should you with out in the woods and talk?

237
00:25:39.640 --> 00:25:45.120
Should we talk a little, you?
 I'm still going out and pissing.

238
00:25:45.280 --> 00:25:50.120
Quiet now!
 - Should women take more care?

239
00:25:50.280 --> 00:25:57.960
- The men can't do it for them ... - you get a slant if you come along!

240
00:25:58.120 --> 00:26:01.680
Sorry!

241
00:26:02.680 --> 00:26:10.200
-I do not understand what you mean.
 -You do not understand what I mean?

242
00:26:10.360 --> 00:26:16.320
- I think you have anger within you.
 –Lill there, yes!

243
00:26:17.400 --> 00:26:22.880
- If you listen, you feel better.
 - Learn to listen, yes.

244
00:26:23.040 --> 00:26:27.760
Then you will feel much better.

245
00:26:27.920 --> 00:26:32.720
Kerstin, I love you!

246
00:26:32.880 --> 00:26:38.320
- Kerstin, I'm really sad.
 - I love Kerstin!

247
00:26:38.480 --> 00:26:45.560
We end the program.
 Look next week as David has become himself!

248
00:27:38.960 --> 00:27:43.640
"Who is clamping on my bridge?"
 shouted the troll.

249
00:27:43.800 --> 00:27:50.840
"It's just me," replied the little goat Bruse ... Sörping

250
00:27:51.000 --> 00:27:57.400
Mon, you have to be quiet!
 Otherwise, you may not be in here.

251
00:27:58.760 --> 00:28:03.160
SVT Program Setting: Britta Landén Bergman
