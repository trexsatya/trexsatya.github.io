1
00:00:03,125 --> 00:00:04,833
A day at work begins with

2
00:00:04,833 --> 00:00:06,416
that I meet up my guard team

3
00:00:06,583 --> 00:00:08,750
We get information about what has happened

4
00:00:08,750 --> 00:00:11,208
And what will happen during the shift.

5
00:00:11,375 --> 00:00:13,916
The Sea Center's task is around the clock

6
00:00:13,916 --> 00:00:15,000
all year round

7
00:00:15,083 --> 00:00:18,083
Give the manager a location of the Baltic Sea.

8
00:00:19,250 --> 00:00:21,625
To get that picture we use everything in from

9
00:00:21,625 --> 00:00:24,625
radar to aircraft and vessels.

10
00:00:25,375 --> 00:00:28,375
We cooperate both with our own units out at sea

11
00:00:28,958 --> 00:00:30,708
and other actors such as

12
00:00:30,708 --> 00:00:31,583
Coast Guard.

13
00:00:32,125 --> 00:00:34,875
The working days in the central are often long

14
00:00:34,875 --> 00:00:36,250
and tempovary,

15
00:00:36,250 --> 00:00:38,583
Therefore, it is important to be able to quickly change tempo

16
00:00:38,583 --> 00:00:40,041
If something happens.

17
00:00:42,125 --> 00:00:44,250
In our guard team we work closely together

18
00:00:44,250 --> 00:00:45,958
And we are more than just colleagues.

19
00:00:46,375 --> 00:00:49,000
In the Armed Forces there are no typical days

20
00:00:49,416 --> 00:00:51,375
Every day I face new challenges

21
00:00:51,500 --> 00:00:52,916
And I feel that I am growing as a person.

22
00:00:53,708 --> 00:00:55,208
To work in the Armed Forces

23
00:00:55,208 --> 00:00:56,625
means that I every day

24
00:00:56,750 --> 00:00:58,375
is part of something bigger.

25
00:00:58,791 --> 00:01:00,041
My name is Saga

26
00:01:00,083 --> 00:01:01,041
and I work as

27
00:01:01,041 --> 00:01:03,375
Maritime surveillance operator.
