1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,160
What does the investment climate look like for unlisted companies?

2
00:00:04,240 --> 00:00:06,360
And how do it go-

3
00:00:06,440 --> 00:00:11,440
-Klar CEO Sebastian Siemiatkowski's investment company Flat Capital-

4
00:00:11,520 --> 00:00:16,400
-which, among other things, invested in Open AI where it has been messy lately.

5
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:20,360
We will talk about that in today's EFN market.
 Welcome.

6
00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:29,640
-Welcome Hanna Wachtmeister.
 -Thanks.
 Fun to be here.

7
00:00:29,720 --> 00:00:34,200
Fun to have you here.
 You are CEO of the investment company Flat Capital.

8
00:00:34,280 --> 00:00:41,640
Today we will talk about trends and the investment climate for mainly unlisted companies.

9
00:00:41,720 --> 00:00:46,040
But also about flat capital, of course.
 We start there.

10
00:00:46,120 --> 00:00:49,880
What is Flat Capital for companies?

11
00:00:49,960 --> 00:00:55,720
Flat Capital is listed since 2021. A small investment company-

12
00:00:55,800 --> 00:01:00,800
-What is checked and owned mainly by Sebastian and Nina Siemiatkowski.

13
00:01:00,880 --> 00:01:06,520
-It started ... -klar -founder and CEO.

14
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:10,800
Good.
 You get stuck in who they are ...

15
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:18,920
Nina and Sebastian with their entrepreneurial travel were given the opportunity to invest-

16
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:26,200
-In other entrepreneurs around 2013, when Flat Capital saw their first light.

17
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:33,000
They began to invest in, among other things, budbee, or today Instabe, and Truecaller.

18
00:01:33,080 --> 00:01:39,320
Can you tell us a little more about your strategy and why are you focusing on unlisted companies?

19
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:48,560
Our strategy has its basis very much in mainly Sebastian's experiences-

20
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:55,440
-When I was in.
 Brief

21
00:01:55,520 --> 00:02:00,560
-They we believe that an interesting return profile is-

22
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:06,920
-In the opportunity to be long -term.
 Being a long -term investor in companies.

23
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:12,080
Because it takes time to build companies.
 Not four years.

24
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:18,120
Klarna ... Sebastian has been holding on for 18 years.
 And will last for another 18 years.

25
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:21,400
Building good companies takes time.

26
00:02:21,480 --> 00:02:26,200
And do you have a fund structure that is common in the unlisted world-

27
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:29,920
-If the funds often have a lifetime, they are built up.

28
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:38,760
And there is a possible conflict in how you build companies and maximize value-

29
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:43,960
-Man between if you are a "venture capital"-investor-

30
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:47,120
-or if you can be with the whole trip.

31
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:54,280
We try to be long -term.
 We do not take a lot of charges-

32
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:59,320
-As a company, without we will cover our salaries and keep costs low.

33
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:06,120
And we will invest through our network, because it is the most unique with flat.

34
00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:10,080
The network that the Board has.

35
00:03:10,160 --> 00:03:12,400
How early do you go into companies?

36
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:16,840
We have said, and it has to do with Flat being an early company ...

37
00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:23,880
... that we now do not want to limit ourselves to clear mandate-

38
00:03:23,960 --> 00:03:28,440
-As just investing in a particular phase or in a certain type of company.

39
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:33,600
Then the risk becomes quite high that we must not invest in something we want to invest in.

40
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:38,080
We started with a very flexible mandate.
 In practice-

41
00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:41,680
-Can we can invest in whatever we want.

42
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:46,400
But what we can, is good at and believe in right now-

43
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:54,680
-Is companies that have received capital-rich, very good investors-

44
00:03:54,760 --> 00:04:00,320
-When we take back.
 Companies that may have found-

45
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:07,200
-What customer segments to go on and what product or service they really have.

46
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:10,320
You have still come a little bit on your trip.

47
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:17,040
We can do startup, but this is not something we generally focus on right now.

48
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:23,120
And your approach is a bit "hands off".
 What does that mean?

49
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:29,440
We are not active owners in our companies.
 We are very small in quite large companies.

50
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:35,320
For example, we do not have board representation.

51
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:42,840
We back the contractors and are always available.

52
00:04:42,920 --> 00:04:49,800
We try to maintain good relationships with all portfolio companies.
 And in almost all cases-

53
00:04:49,880 --> 00:04:54,920
-We have it.
 But we do not actively work with them.
 Because then it had not worked-

54
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,080
-with only two employees.

55
00:04:57,160 --> 00:05:02,040
In the picture we see your holdings.

56
00:05:02,120 --> 00:05:07,000
There is any red thread except that most are unlisted.

57
00:05:07,080 --> 00:05:10,360
Unlit is the red thread.

58
00:05:10,440 --> 00:05:14,760
But I think the companies, which come from many different sectors-

59
00:05:14,840 --> 00:05:21,920
-In addition to being unlisted, they have fantastic basic teams that lead the companies.

60
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:27,840
We really believe in them.
 They have extremely capable investors with themselves-

61
00:05:27,920 --> 00:05:34,240
-In its “cap table” that has a history of doing very good return-

62
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:39,760
-To their investments.
 And who believe in these companies, and so do we, of course.

63
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:46,320
They have a scalable business model and can grow globally.

64
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:52,200
Right.
 Open AI is interesting.
 We'll talk a little more about it in a while.

65
00:05:52,280 --> 00:05:59,720
But we can look at a list of your largest holdings here which is invested capital.

66
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:05,520
Yes.
 It is easy when you see this list, to think, which is understandable-

67
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:09,320
-That this is the largest holdings in the portfolio.

68
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:14,560
But unfortunately in the unlisted world, or as it works in the unlisted world-

69
00:06:14,640 --> 00:06:18,080
-So they are not noted on an active market-

70
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:23,240
-What they have their capital raising rounds when setting new values-

71
00:06:23,320 --> 00:06:27,240
-What means that the values ...

72
00:06:27,320 --> 00:06:33,320
They can change a lot, sometimes fast and sometimes not so fast.

73
00:06:33,400 --> 00:06:39,560
So in the Klarna case we have invested the equivalent of 34 million, a little over.

74
00:06:39,640 --> 00:06:45,320
But then they did a round last summer, when the holding was written down-

75
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:48,960
-In connection to a capital raising as they did.

76
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:54,400
And we have other examples of this list, type budbee or instabbee-

77
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:58,040
-Where invested capital is 7.5 million-

78
00:06:58,120 --> 00:07:04,000
-But the company is valued significantly higher today after different rounds.

79
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:10,840
So you should not see this list as facts on the largest holding.

80
00:07:10,920 --> 00:07:14,080
Then you are listed on First North.

81
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:19,560
We can look at a graph of the development of the share price.

82
00:07:19,640 --> 00:07:25,680
Is it a reasonable reflection on how it goes for your invested companies?

83
00:07:25,760 --> 00:07:32,000
Yes ... I'm not, which is nice ... I as CEO should not have that much with-

84
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:37,000
-The market pricing of Flat Capital's share to do.

85
00:07:37,080 --> 00:07:41,040
The market is awarded flat capital.

86
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:48,440
What you can see ... Then we are a relatively small company with quite a few small savers.

87
00:07:48,520 --> 00:07:52,600
So relatively speaking we have a pretty okay liquidity-

88
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:56,480
-To be such a small company on First North.

89
00:07:56,560 --> 00:08:00,960
And it's fun that there is liquidity, but it's not huge.

90
00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:06,320
We want it to get better over time, as we get bigger.

91
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:13,560
The general is that you have seen that it has been very up and down, volatile-

92
00:08:13,640 --> 00:08:18,960
-And it is probably a pretty healthy reflection that it has been a very volatile market.

93
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:26,800
Then I think we generally have had a small premium to the last reported hub-

94
00:08:26,880 --> 00:08:32,520
-What may be reflected in the fact that our portfolio of companies are companies that cannot be achieved-

95
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:37,760
-By investing on the stock exchange.
 So that's the unique, maybe, in our portfolio.

96
00:08:37,840 --> 00:08:43,320
Right.
 Your net asset value, there is a premium on it, on how many percent right now?

97
00:08:43,400 --> 00:08:49,680
I would like to add to this list of companies where you see invested capital ...

98
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:55,080
I know this is something that has been a bit problematic for us when it comes to ...

99
00:08:55,160 --> 00:08:59,840
We only report our aggregate net asset value.
 Then the we-

100
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:07,280
-When we make an investment.
 But we do not have at portfolio level level latest valuation-

101
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:11,480
-What is something that we obviously think a lot on-

102
00:09:11,560 --> 00:09:15,200
-And is thinking about how we can become more transparent over time.

103
00:09:15,280 --> 00:09:21,040
Why the situation looks so is because we have the opportunity to enter these companies-

104
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:26,080
-On these premises.
 There is a lot of American legislation-

105
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:30,480
-while means that if we were to go out every quarter and report the values-

106
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:35,000
-So we would not be allowed to invest in these companies, simply.

107
00:09:35,080 --> 00:09:40,040
The contractors in these companies have for competition reasons or other ...

108
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:43,360
They do not want their values to be seen too much.

109
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:48,840
So these are these two scales all the time, that we are considering.

110
00:09:48,920 --> 00:09:52,640
Today, how big is the premium on your net asset value?

111
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:57,680
14 % I have for me.
 But there.

112
00:09:57,760 --> 00:10:02,640
-And then it moves very much, of course.
 -We looked at the course here ...

113
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:08,600
The last rise in November came after information that Klarna should be listed on the stock exchange.

114
00:10:08,680 --> 00:10:12,720
If that happens, what would it mean for your investment in Klarna?

115
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:17,440
It is a good question, and something that we discuss on the board.

116
00:10:17,520 --> 00:10:22,240
The principle question is ... We are very much associated with Klarna-

117
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:27,480
-In that Sebastian is the CEO and founder of Klarna.

118
00:10:27,560 --> 00:10:32,600
And flat had not been found without clear, you can claim.

119
00:10:32,680 --> 00:10:38,880
But it is probably about ... "Can we sit on a listed holding in our portfolio?"

120
00:10:38,960 --> 00:10:43,000
And there we probably have to come back, I think.

121
00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:46,440
But that is something that we can absolutely absolutely.

122
00:10:46,520 --> 00:10:52,720
For example, we are still at a post in Truecaller, which is also a listed company.

123
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:58,840
But our business concept is based on being unlisted.
 So I have to come back around it.

124
00:10:58,920 --> 00:11:04,360
Earlier this year you chose to invest SEK 32 million-

125
00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:08,360
-In the shaped American AI company Open Ai-

126
00:11:08,440 --> 00:11:13,080
-which has been noticed to stand behind the chat bot chat gpt-

127
00:11:13,160 --> 00:11:18,680
-And most recently for all tours around their CEO, Sam Altman, who first became kicked-

128
00:11:18,760 --> 00:11:23,480
-And came back.
 What do you say about everything that has happened here?

129
00:11:23,560 --> 00:11:29,440
In the name of honesty, I was certainly as familiar with Finanstwitter, and read News-

130
00:11:29,520 --> 00:11:34,000
-like any other.
 We didn't sit on any unique channel-

131
00:11:34,080 --> 00:11:39,680
-Where we had a lot of exciting insights, but we followed the news.

132
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:43,920
Sebastian has good contact with Sam-

133
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:49,760
-But in this tour, I don't think they have had any special contact.

134
00:11:49,840 --> 00:11:54,440
So I would say it's a bit scary-

135
00:11:54,520 --> 00:12:00,320
-To such a large company with such an important profile ...

136
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:03,800
That it could go that way.

137
00:12:03,880 --> 00:12:09,920
The whole "Corporate Governance" issue is interesting.
 Then it also became clear-

138
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:16,400
-How important this team, Sam Altman with its nearest team-

139
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:23,960
-How important they are for Open AI, and how dedicated they are Open AI.

140
00:12:24,040 --> 00:12:27,920
Scary and at the same time a little cool to see-

141
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:34,080
-The engagement of all employees, and how important it is.

142
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:39,720
So I think Sam and his team, based on what I've read ...

143
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:44,600
After all, it feels like he's really "committed" to run this now.

144
00:12:44,680 --> 00:12:50,080
So it feels safe anyway.
 Although it has been nervous.

145
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:54,560
How did you reason when you chose to invest in the company?

146
00:12:54,640 --> 00:13:00,160
We think AI is an inevitable-

147
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:05,800
-And very exciting and quite scary type of trend, or what to call it.

148
00:13:05,880 --> 00:13:10,200
It is not a sector, but an element that all companies need to take a stand for

149
00:13:10,280 --> 00:13:14,680
-and integrate.
 And it's so big and it goes so fast-

150
00:13:14,760 --> 00:13:18,640
-It is clear that we find it exciting.

151
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:25,640
Then we reason so that it is probably very easy to go wrong and invest wrong.

152
00:13:25,720 --> 00:13:33,600
So our principle is that we think you should go to the winners in this sector-

153
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:42,040
-The ones that are really at the forefront and who are strong profiles in this trend-

154
00:13:42,120 --> 00:13:49,480
-And that other talented investors think you should invest in.

155
00:13:49,560 --> 00:13:52,880
It's probably the great logic.

156
00:13:52,960 --> 00:13:58,280
And then it has to do with networks, that we actually know them through Sebastian.

157
00:13:58,360 --> 00:14:02,640
Right.
 And that they are unlisted.
 Unlike Nvidia, for example.

158
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:04,600
Just.

159
00:14:04,680 --> 00:14:09,560
I thought we should also talk a little about current investment climate-

160
00:14:09,640 --> 00:14:14,440
-For unlisted companies.
 What would you say, what does it look like?

161
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:19,120
I'm still new in this spectrum ...

162
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:26,600
I would say that if it was difficult five years ago, it is probably even more difficult today.

163
00:14:26,680 --> 00:14:31,000
On the one hand, when it comes to how you value growth companies ...

164
00:14:31,080 --> 00:14:35,960
After all, it has been changed completely, with the macroeconomic position-

165
00:14:36,040 --> 00:14:39,920
-and the geopolitical situation.
 It has made it.

166
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:45,920
But also these structural AI trends, that's what is perhaps the big-

167
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:51,840
-They if companies suddenly don't need a startup or 30 developer-

168
00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:56,200
-To produce a product, without they may only need two ...

169
00:14:56,280 --> 00:15:00,560
How do you value such a company in relation to the old by 30?

170
00:15:00,640 --> 00:15:03,200
So there is very much values-

171
00:15:03,280 --> 00:15:08,240
-which may be both questioned but also made possible through AI.

172
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:16,720
So the structural with AI is smart.
 And so we have the macroeconomic situation as too ...

173
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:20,520
This cocktail makes it difficult.

174
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:27,280
Our way of managing it is basically to keep our valuation pragmatic and simple.

175
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:33,000
It's "Art Rather Than Science".
 But we take back on the larger investors-

176
00:15:33,080 --> 00:15:39,160
-What are good at this.
 And we do not put the values in companies that we go into ...

177
00:15:39,240 --> 00:15:42,600
-. without they have already been set.
 -Right.

178
00:15:42,680 --> 00:15:47,480
At the same time, unlisted companies can work more undisturbed than a listed company-

179
00:15:47,560 --> 00:15:51,840
-Where there is more focus and so.
 There is perhaps an advantage in it?

180
00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:57,040
Yes absolutely.
 Ask me.
 After all, we are a small investment company.

181
00:15:57,120 --> 00:16:03,200
There will be quite a lot of work to be listed, purely administrative.

182
00:16:03,280 --> 00:16:07,600
Values build over time.
 It might not go quarter over quarter-

183
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:15,280
-Out you can have this more long -term perspective when you think about value creation.

184
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:20,360
Right.
 Then we have a relatively high interest rate position now.

185
00:16:20,440 --> 00:16:26,160
Which sectors do best and worst in the prevailing market climate?

186
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:32,440
I am not a macroeconomic, but it feels quite reasonable that companies that are capital tongue-

187
00:16:32,520 --> 00:16:38,880
-The also that needs financing and has capital -intensive business models ...

188
00:16:38,960 --> 00:16:41,560
Obviously they get it tougher.

189
00:16:41,640 --> 00:16:44,720
Then I think companies that don't have ...

190
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:49,760
It is some kind of crossroads now in unlisted, at least in a little earlier company ...

191
00:16:49,840 --> 00:16:54,440
It is almost assumed to survive, even for a very nice company-

192
00:16:54,520 --> 00:17:00,520
-That you have capital -strong shareholders with you too.

193
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:05,360
But sectors, it's like these "asset light" companies-

194
00:17:05,440 --> 00:17:10,120
-Tech company that is scalable and that are profitable, of course-

195
00:17:10,200 --> 00:17:15,920
-while solving real problems and that can quickly become global-

196
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:19,360
-or that is not limited to a country ...

197
00:17:19,440 --> 00:17:23,560
They still do well if you have quality in the ground-

198
00:17:23,640 --> 00:17:29,800
-While the real estate industry or highly mortgaged industries, capital -intensive ...

199
00:17:29,880 --> 00:17:32,520
There it is probably clearer.

200
00:17:32,600 --> 00:17:39,000
Is that what you look at a little?
 Is it a good location to buy companies cheaper now?

201
00:17:39,080 --> 00:17:44,360
Yes, the only thing you should be careful about, I think, is ... what is cheap?

202
00:17:44,440 --> 00:17:49,560
There are many companies that can look cheap when you look at multiple level-

203
00:17:49,640 --> 00:17:54,480
-or on how they deliver.
 So the answer is in principle yes.

204
00:17:54,560 --> 00:17:56,960
The values have dropped.

205
00:17:57,040 --> 00:18:01,600
The important thing is to ensure that you invest in companies that continue to grow-

206
00:18:01,680 --> 00:18:04,040
-So they are not in a giant lame spiral.

207
00:18:04,120 --> 00:18:08,960
Because then maybe "cheap" at multiple level is really very expensive.

208
00:18:09,040 --> 00:18:14,440
So you have to be careful when saying: "Oh, what cheap it looks."

209
00:18:14,520 --> 00:18:19,320
You have to keep your tongue in your mouth, or what you say.

210
00:18:19,400 --> 00:18:26,960
And finally, what are you looking for?
 What trends do you look forward?
 Where are you looking?

211
00:18:27,040 --> 00:18:30,760
We have had quite interesting discussions.

212
00:18:30,840 --> 00:18:35,360
We really have, especially with Sebastian, but also in the board-

213
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:41,600
-The insights in large companies and what they take a stand now and what they see ...

214
00:18:41,680 --> 00:18:49,920
We have a great spect of AI and the value risk that comes with it.

215
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:57,600
Check out all these large companies built on tech.
 They need to change a lot.

216
00:18:57,680 --> 00:19:01,800
There are opportunities and up pages with it, but those who do not see it ...

217
00:19:01,880 --> 00:19:10,040
Maybe they should beware of them.
 So much discussions about tech companies and the AI angle.

218
00:19:10,120 --> 00:19:14,240
Then we also discussed: What is not AI?

219
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:20,040
Thus, are there sectors and companies that are not affected to the same degree by AI?

220
00:19:20,120 --> 00:19:25,680
It's a little easier.
 So we have many fun discussions.
 We will see what happens.

221
00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:32,560
But we have also looked at companies that may not be in the eye of the storm when it comes to AI.

222
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:35,880
I understand.
 That's all we got along today.

223
00:19:35,960 --> 00:19:39,560
-Tort thank you, Hanna Wachtmeister.
 -Thanks.

224
00:19:39,640 --> 00:19:42,240
Thanks also to those looking at EFN market.

225
00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:48,680
If you like the program, please give a thumbs up to it on Youtube.
