1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,160
14 years of struggle.
 I have gone through a depression and a separation.

2
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:07,960
I got my "Eureka Moment".

3
00:00:08,040 --> 00:00:12,680
I was standing at a Rejvfest in London when it suddenly came to me.

4
00:00:12,760 --> 00:00:16,200
Damn, I see it, I know how to do it.

5
00:00:16,280 --> 00:00:22,000
A few months later I lived in Bolivia.
 Most things went wrong there.

6
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:26,800
I wanted to be so happy.
 We were hours from a bankruptcy.

7
00:00:29,120 --> 00:00:33,760
"Not a chance. No one wants to invest in such a company."

8
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:40,000
Lars Kristensson has invested everything in the realization of the entrepreneurial dream-

9
00:00:40,080 --> 00:00:45,160
-He carried on since 2008. Although he does not look at himself as an entrepreneur.

10
00:00:45,240 --> 00:00:48,680
That was never what I thought I would be.

11
00:00:48,760 --> 00:00:52,000
I was necessarily.

12
00:00:52,080 --> 00:00:56,040
And because I want to give my innovation to the world-

13
00:00:56,120 --> 00:01:02,680
-If it was necessary to run a company and go the way I have gone.

14
00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:08,440
Today, Lars Kristensson is the man behind the air search site Aviono who is on its way to-

15
00:01:08,520 --> 00:01:13,520
-Take up the struggle with industry giants such as momondo, air travel.se and expedia.

16
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:19,640
At home in the apartment in Malmö, he talks about the long road to Afiono's birth.

17
00:01:19,720 --> 00:01:23,480
As a teenager he created his first computer game.

18
00:01:23,560 --> 00:01:28,960
And when he studied computer science in Lund and discovered AI, he found home.

19
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:36,680
Suddenly I got together all the parts I am interested in.
 I have an easy time for math.

20
00:01:36,760 --> 00:01:40,000
Has easy for programming and the logical.

21
00:01:40,080 --> 00:01:45,440
I am interested in philosophy and love people and psychology.

22
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:50,280
Actually, it is most important to me: people and psychology.

23
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:54,400
But to get together computer science, math, people and psychology-

24
00:01:54,480 --> 00:01:58,400
-Do not be so easy until I finally landed in AI.

25
00:01:58,480 --> 00:02:00,960
Before he had completed the study-

26
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:04,840
-They he had headhunted to one of Sweden's largest gaming companies-

27
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:10,360
-But ended some time later for ethical reasons.
 He did not want to make products-

28
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:15,440
-As was aimed at getting users to never want to leave their screens.

29
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:18,680
He himself has not played for a second since then.

30
00:02:18,760 --> 00:02:24,360
Instead, he ended up in the travel industry and quickly discovered how inflexible-

31
00:02:24,440 --> 00:02:27,280
-The aviation sites on the net worked.

32
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:31,920
But changing was difficult to technically and the industry was conservative.

33
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:35,560
In the end, after scratching it for so long ...

34
00:02:35,640 --> 00:02:39,480
... I saw it.
 I got my "Eureka Moment".

35
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:44,320
I was standing at a Rejvfest in London when it suddenly came to me.

36
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:48,360
Damn, I see it, I know how to do it.

37
00:02:48,440 --> 00:02:55,280
I sat down on an oil barrel, pondered and structured my thoughts.

38
00:02:55,360 --> 00:03:02,240
What I cracked was how to get over the restrictions-

39
00:03:02,320 --> 00:03:07,480
-In the underlying layers.
 How you can make completely open searches.

40
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:16,080
The search technique I sketched out makes it possible to search in free dimensions in endless space.

41
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:21,120
Free dimensions and endless space

42
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:25,400
—power that it became possible to make the open and flexible searches-

43
00:03:25,480 --> 00:03:30,280
-When previously been impossible.
 Like searching for destinations with a particular climate-

44
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:35,080
-Combined with other characteristics such as family -friendly or restaurant -proof.

45
00:03:35,160 --> 00:03:38,800
He tried to implement his innovation at one of the industry giants-

46
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:44,240
-When today belongs to Aviono's competitors, but even there he encountered resistance.

47
00:03:44,320 --> 00:03:48,520
Instead, he was headhunted again, this time to South America.

48
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:51,520
A few months later I lived in Bolivia.

49
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:55,680
And tried to lead a development team there instead.

50
00:03:56,920 --> 00:03:59,880
It didn't go so well.

51
00:03:59,960 --> 00:04:02,480
-Usch ... -What happened there?

52
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:07,760
No ... most things went wrong there.

53
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:13,560
It sounded like gold and green forests when I got there.

54
00:04:13,640 --> 00:04:17,800
I got a fantastic offer, but ...

55
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:20,800
No, there wasn't much that worked.

56
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:26,120
The money that would have existed was not there, the organization did not work ...

57
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:31,160
No.
 Most things didn't work.
 So that project did not go well.

58
00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:33,800
Did you discover it pretty quickly?

59
00:04:33,880 --> 00:04:39,120
Not fast enough.
 And I kept fighting, because I wanted to so gladly-

60
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:43,240
-That it would go well.
 So I fought myself.

61
00:04:43,320 --> 00:04:48,120
But the South American adventure was not in vain.

62
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:53,240
Within the framework of the project in Bolivia, Lars Kristensson announced a competition.

63
00:04:53,320 --> 00:04:55,360
To design a flight search site.

64
00:04:55,440 --> 00:05:02,080
Halfway into the competition, a contribution came in that did not resemble anything else.

65
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:07,640
Strange, odd ... until I saw it.

66
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:11,760
Until I saw through what he had done.

67
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:19,520
Whoever the person was, he had gone much deeper into his design-

68
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:23,840
-Ever I have ever seen someone else do.
 He went completely outside the box-

69
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:30,480
-Ad all the requirements of the competition, but redefined the entire structure of the design-

70
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:38,200
-And solved actual user problems at a depth I've never seen before.

71
00:05:38,280 --> 00:05:44,200
I was so deeply impressed and fascinated that I wrote to him.

72
00:05:44,280 --> 00:05:48,520
"Hello. I see what you do. Who are you?"

73
00:05:50,040 --> 00:05:53,200
It turned out to be Anton.

74
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:59,360
It was the well -qualified Russian interaction designer Anton Tyulenev.

75
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:08,000
While the project in South America went to hell, Anton and I couldn't stop discussing.

76
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:10,800
We couldn't stop saving and talking.

77
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:18,800
So I finally went home to Malmö.
 I was very worn and broken.

78
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:24,320
Now I shit in this, I thought.
 Now I do something else.

79
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:28,000
But why did you think so?
 It went to hell in Bolivia-

80
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:31,120
-But you had found your future couple horse.

81
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:38,120
Absolutely.
 But I had already made several attempts.
 I had been fighting for several years.

82
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:41,520
-And ... -you were exhausted.

83
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:44,880
Yes, I was absolutely exhausted.

84
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:50,080
He had simply gone into the wall and decided to put down the plans-

85
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:54,680
-To start your own company.
 But Anton Tyulenev thought differently.

86
00:06:54,760 --> 00:07:00,600
He didn't listen.
 Instead he stood at a whiteboard-

87
00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:06,200
-And showed what he had been thinking about.
 "What are you thinking about this?"

88
00:07:06,280 --> 00:07:13,960
He triggered me so I started sketching on how to do it.

89
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:19,200
So he looked at me: "You can't stop."

90
00:07:21,160 --> 00:07:25,080
Then followed a couple of months of persuasion on his part.

91
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:31,760
"Shit in everything that has been and everyone else," he told me.
 "We're doing this."

92
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:37,400
"You and I do this. We are two of the most competent in our respective areas"-

93
00:07:37,480 --> 00:07:41,400
-"Who the hell can beat us? We're doing this."

94
00:07:41,480 --> 00:07:46,160
It had been in 2015 before the company Aveiono founded-

95
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:49,560
-A Lars Kristensson and Anton Tyulenev in Malmö.

96
00:07:49,640 --> 00:07:52,000
Then the work of creating-

97
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:56,200
-This, in their words, would be "the world's best flight search site".

98
00:07:56,280 --> 00:07:59,640
Three years and a first investment round later-

99
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:03,720
-Kunde An audience beta site will be launched January 2018.

100
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:07,320
Then we were it for a long time in beta to test.

101
00:08:07,400 --> 00:08:12,960
We wanted sharp data and users, so we tested and ited for quite a long time.

102
00:08:13,040 --> 00:08:19,920
And finally launched Aviono December 1.0, 2019.

103
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:25,200
Sharp version.
 We felt we had the concept in place.

104
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:28,800
Then we would go out and lift marketing money-

105
00:08:28,880 --> 00:08:31,240
-and do our go-to-market ...

106
00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:36,160
And we had intended to close it in March 2020.

107
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:43,480
But the first few weeks in March 2020, the entire travel industry closed down.
 Completely.

108
00:08:43,560 --> 00:08:45,840
-Pandemic.
 -Yes.

109
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:55,040
It was hard.
 Like running into a wall.

110
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:57,680
But...

111
00:08:57,760 --> 00:09:02,760
After I had landed from the first shock for a week's time-

112
00:09:02,840 --> 00:09:06,280
-I started slowly realizing ...

113
00:09:07,560 --> 00:09:13,200
Wait.
 This doesn't have to be completely negative.

114
00:09:13,280 --> 00:09:20,280
What dampened the panic was that the fall height was not so great.
 You had just started.

115
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:24,640
Could one use time right it would be possible to get out stronger-

116
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:30,680
-If with more infected competitors after the pandemic.
 But then they have to survive.

117
00:09:30,760 --> 00:09:33,080
And for that, money was required.

118
00:09:33,160 --> 00:09:39,400
That was the problem.
 We had already done our launch-

119
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:47,920
-And ended liquidity, so we were hours from a bankruptcy.

120
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:51,280
Literally.
 When we got the solution in place-

121
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:57,120
- We were less than twelve hours from the board meeting that would have decided on bankruptcy.

122
00:09:57,200 --> 00:10:02,080
Old and new investors saved the company from bankruptcy.
 And with new money-

123
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:07,520
-Cheat development of the service continue.
 Aviono survived even though pandemin-

124
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:09,800
-Gleaned longer than most people could imagine.

125
00:10:09,880 --> 00:10:16,760
During the years of struggle through the pandemic, I finally saw that it opened up.

126
00:10:16,840 --> 00:10:21,320
The vaccine works, until spring it opens up.

127
00:10:21,400 --> 00:10:26,440
We planned for it, put up our strategy.
 We were ready to run our go-to market.

128
00:10:26,520 --> 00:10:31,720
Now we drive the one we would have done when the pandemic came.

129
00:10:33,880 --> 00:10:37,360
We are ready.
 First we pick in 10 million-

130
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:41,320
-As a first step to finally come out and be visible.

131
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:48,240
Said and done.
 We signed up a "Corp company" to help us.

132
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:53,440
And so on.
 Everything was rigged to run go-to-market in spring-

133
00:10:53,520 --> 00:10:55,960
-In connection with everything opening up.

134
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:04,520
Aviono 2.0 was launched in December 2021.

135
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:07,400
But by the planned marketing campaign-

136
00:11:07,480 --> 00:11:10,840
-And upset in the winter of 2022 there was nothing.

137
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:16,920
February 24, the Russian tank rolled into Ukraine and the war was a fact.

138
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,960
And suddenly everything changed.

139
00:11:20,040 --> 00:11:26,160
Again.
 After all, Anton is Russian.

140
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:29,360
And lived in Moscow.

141
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:34,600
And most people in our development team sat in Russia.

142
00:11:34,680 --> 00:11:41,280
There the Corp company backed down.
 "Not a chance. No one wants to invest in such a company."

143
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:44,880
We got to restructure the company fundamentally.

144
00:11:44,960 --> 00:11:49,920
Today no one sits in Russia.
 Anton has been allowed to leave and relocate-

145
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,960
-We have had to reorganize the company ...

146
00:11:54,440 --> 00:11:57,520
-So that it ... -has Anton left Russia?

147
00:11:57,600 --> 00:12:05,080
Yes.
 And the developers have either left Russia or the company.

148
00:12:05,160 --> 00:12:09,800
-Fann's Russian invested money in the company?
 -No.

149
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:17,120
No, we do not have that.
 Now it's "Clean", but it's been a process.

150
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:22,480
It had been late autumn by 2022, the situation for the company was again critical.

151
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:26,480
But with the smallest possible margin, Aviono survived again.

152
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:32,040
During the winter and spring, the struggle continued to keep the nose above the surface of the water.

153
00:12:32,120 --> 00:12:36,240
A situation that has become a normal state for the company.

154
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:43,000
In the autumn of 2023, Lars Kristensson contacted EFN.
 Something had happened in Aviono.

155
00:12:43,080 --> 00:12:47,520
Now I will meet Lars Kristensson at his office in central Malmö.

156
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:53,320
It's been almost a year since we were last seen.
 The question is: How has it been?

157
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:58,800
Most were giving up at the end of the year.

158
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:04,440
Our accountant had given up, my parents had given up, that is.

159
00:13:04,520 --> 00:13:10,080
-The most people were probably prepared for a bankruptcy.
 -But it didn't.

160
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:12,600
-No.
 -Where do you stand today?

161
00:13:12,680 --> 00:13:18,080
Now we see an explosive increase in our site-

162
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:22,520
-A fantastic growth right now.

163
00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:27,840
We haven't come to the Breakven yet.
 So the next step is to secure up-

164
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:33,720
-The last funding needed for us to become a profitable company.

165
00:13:33,800 --> 00:13:38,520
-When have you intended to be according to plan?
 -When the forecast looks now ...

166
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:42,760
... we will be profitable before the end of next year.

167
00:13:42,840 --> 00:13:48,960
What became a turnaround was when one of the employees managed to find a technical solution-

168
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:55,320
-This meant that it was possible to capture resiliented internet surfers considerably faster.

169
00:13:55,400 --> 00:14:01,240
It was about being visible high on Google, without having to pay big money for it.

170
00:14:01,320 --> 00:14:09,000
It has been a complete breakthrough.
 When we felt confident that this-

171
00:14:09,080 --> 00:14:17,160
-really was an opening, we started developing it and launched at the end of May-

172
00:14:17,240 --> 00:14:21,400
-A first, sharp version of the solution.

173
00:14:21,480 --> 00:14:28,280
Only the first few days in June we got the very first digits.

174
00:14:28,360 --> 00:14:35,600
When we saw them, I and Anton cheered, because then we knew this was going to work.

175
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:39,040
This will go away and go well.

176
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:44,880
But can we say that Aviono has survived now?

177
00:14:44,960 --> 00:14:48,160
I think we can do that, actually.

178
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:54,240
We will reach Break-Even as well, we are still not funded to Break-ven.

179
00:14:54,320 --> 00:15:00,200
That is what we are working on now, but I think we can say that Aviono has survived.

180
00:15:00,280 --> 00:15:05,320
-I think this will succeed.
 -You have struggled incredibly much with this ...

181
00:15:05,400 --> 00:15:09,600
... it is evident from the report, you have gone on some bangs.

182
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:14,960
Has it been worth the personal price you have had to pay?

183
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:21,600
I said a number of years ago that no matter how it goes, it will never be worth it.

184
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:28,160
-And I'll probably not change the story.
 -It means you hadn't done it?

185
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:32,720
-I hadn't done it.
 -But now you have done it, so now you drive?

186
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:38,160
However, in contrast to it, it will never be worth it-

187
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:45,200
-I have I over and over again re -evaluated and looked at: Is it worth continuing?

188
00:15:45,280 --> 00:15:48,800
But based on each given point on the road-

189
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:54,440
-Have always the most rational and best choice has been to continue.

190
00:15:54,520 --> 00:15:58,560
How big do you think Aviono can be?

191
00:15:58,640 --> 00:16:04,680
"Can be?"
 It can be any size.
 We are constructed-

192
00:16:04,760 --> 00:16:11,280
-To be able to take over the market.
 Then it takes so much more to be the biggest.

193
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:16,400
But in terms of construction; structurally aviono-

194
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:21,520
-Factically rigged to become the biggest player in the world on this.
