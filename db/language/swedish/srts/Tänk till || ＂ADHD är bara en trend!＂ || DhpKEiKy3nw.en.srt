1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.260
"Why can't you sit still do not blame your ADHD."

2
00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:17.200
Today we will talk about ADHD and ADD.
 What diagnoses do you have all

3
00:00:17.360 --> 00:00:19.720
Adhd.
 -Add.

4
00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:21.960
Add.
 -Adhd.

5
00:00:22.120 --> 00:00:24.000
Adhd.
 -Adhd.

6
00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:29.880
How was it before you were diagnosed?
 -Chaos.

7
00:00:30.040 --> 00:00:35.520
For me, it was kind of that I felt completely abnormal.

8
00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:40.800
I could run out into the corridor, and everyone just looked.

9
00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:45.800
When I talked to my parents, they were ...

10
00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:52.760
It wasn't taboo, but they said, "Stop trampling. You're just small."

11
00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:56.480
Was it you who took the initiative?
 -Yes.

12
00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:01.160
You others, then does anyone recognize the reaction?

13
00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:05.600
Mom said: "Don't be stupid. What do you say"

14
00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:10.720
"It's not just me, but you and my little brother."

15
00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:15.520
My little brother was recently diagnosed with ADHD

16
00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:21.120
So the probability is greater that I have it.

17
00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:24.280
How has the investigation gone to

18
00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:30.400
It started when I was nine and the first year of high school.

19
00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:36.760
I noticed in the eighth that I could not concentrate.

20
00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:39.680
We are like this.

21
00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:44.720
What are you tired of hearing are there comments?

22
00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:50.640
That you are lazy.
 -That you are a steam child.

23
00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:56.520
"Now comes her fucking hyperventilations. 'Oh, my good'"

24
00:01:56.680 --> 00:02:02.760
Where do you hear that?
 In school?
 -Everywhere.
 Home.

25
00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:09.240
"You are so lazy. You have school."
 It takes me anyway.

26
00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:15.440
Medicine takes your energy so that you do not use it unprofessionally.

27
00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:21.080
Without medicine you run around, then you have to sleep.

28
00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:26.240
Do people usually joke about you?
 -Yes, giant.

29
00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:31.160
You are "Messy" and neglect stuff.

30
00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:37.880
"Flash Gordon" I have been told.
 -It's a superhero?

31
00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:42.800
You are ass -fast and run around.
 It's kind of it ...

32
00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:50.080
Are there any taboo about having diagnoses What have you come across?

33
00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:52.600
Vladimir

34
00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:59.760
In the beginning I did not get the support I needed from my parents.

35
00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:03.760
Culture has a lot to do with it.

36
00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:10.080
There is a lot of ignorance about other cultures.
 They don't know that much.

37
00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:14.360
You are a bit questionable and careful.

38
00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:17.720
Can you give any examples

39
00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:24.440
Mom was not very positive in the beginning, but waiting and cautious.

40
00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:31.200
She wanted more information, even though I wanted to proceed with the investigation.

41
00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:34.200
Was it the same for you

42
00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:37.680
My Dad still believes today

43
00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:44.440
Because he thinks that when he was growing up, they did not have mental illness.

44
00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:51.480
For him it is religious.
 "You have a demon you have something in you!"

45
00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:56.080
"We'll pick up an exorcist and fix you"

46
00:03:56.240 --> 00:03:59.800
Mom said she knew about the ADHD.

47
00:03:59.960 --> 00:04:04.640
"You're like a Duracell rabbit running around!"

48
00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:10.640
Nor, you got your diagnosis quite late.
 What could it be due to

49
00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:17.160
The thing is that I am quite calm, though the concentration was completely pie.

50
00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:22.280
I could never complete my tasks.

51
00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:27.880
I think the teachers thought I would fix it

52
00:04:28.040 --> 00:04:35.200
Without thinking that I might need help, which I did not have-

53
00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:38.920
until just before the student.

54
00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:42.440
And then you went into an investigation

55
00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:48.760
My friend who plugged into a treating educator said I had ADD.

56
00:04:48.920 --> 00:04:53.920
"I'll call BUP" ... -She knew right away.

57
00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:59.480
She booked a meeting, and there I was diagnosed

58
00:04:59.640 --> 00:05:04.360
And medicines.
 I was behind in all courses.

59
00:05:04.520 --> 00:05:12.000
I had too much information, but with medicines I fixed it.

60
00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:17.960
Do you still take medication?
 -After high school I threw them.

61
00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:24.760
You get so much anxiety attacks from them.
 Rough side effects.

62
00:05:24.920 --> 00:05:29.520
What is the difference between ADD and ADHD

63
00:05:29.680 --> 00:05:36.400
Without hyperactivity.
 Everything is inboard.
 The chaos is inboard.

64
00:05:36.560 --> 00:05:43.640
It may not be as visible.
 -Therefore, it's not that notable.

65
00:05:43.800 --> 00:05:46.600
Many have ignorance of ADD.

66
00:05:46.760 --> 00:05:52.200
Will it be more difficult to discover then?
 -Much harder.

67
00:05:52.360 --> 00:05:58.080
Can you others tell us how it was before and after the diagnosis

68
00:05:58.240 --> 00:06:01.240
I was only seen as a chaos child.

69
00:06:01.400 --> 00:06:06.040
My dad doesn't believe in mental diagnoses.

70
00:06:06.200 --> 00:06:11.800
"We don't have stuff like that in Africa. Only Westerners have such things."

71
00:06:11.960 --> 00:06:14.720
"Children should run around."

72
00:06:14.880 --> 00:06:19.440
But at school I had no focus at all.

73
00:06:19.600 --> 00:06:26.000
I always had to drum on everything on the tables, the chairs ...

74
00:06:26.160 --> 00:06:32.160
Everything was a drum for me, and I had to run around

75
00:06:32.320 --> 00:06:35.920
Because I have so much energy.

76
00:06:36.080 --> 00:06:42.560
In the end, you explode and scream and just have to do something.

77
00:06:42.720 --> 00:06:45.960
Then you had nothing to blame.

78
00:06:46.120 --> 00:06:53.520
"I'm not like any other child, because they are calm and can focus."

79
00:06:53.680 --> 00:06:57.240
"I'm just like a big explosion."

80
00:06:57.400 --> 00:07:02.760
When I was diagnosed, I knew what was wrong

81
00:07:02.920 --> 00:07:08.480
Or what is the basis for why I am who I am.

82
00:07:08.640 --> 00:07:14.200
Then it became easier to understand what you can do.

83
00:07:14.360 --> 00:07:20.760
I did not have any medicine, because I have always been told "horror stories"

84
00:07:20.920 --> 00:07:28.080
About panic attacks, but I already had such things and didn't need more.

85
00:07:28.240 --> 00:07:34.360
But I got tools instead, which helped so much.

86
00:07:34.520 --> 00:07:37.200
Then I could catch up.

87
00:07:37.360 --> 00:07:42.840
Vladimir.
 What happens if one is not visible and is part of the crowd

88
00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:47.280
You went in a messy class.
 How was it

89
00:07:47.440 --> 00:07:54.200
When you are in a messy environment, you fall into the crowd.

90
00:07:54.360 --> 00:07:57.360
It will be difficult to pay attention to it.

91
00:07:57.520 --> 00:08:04.120
How did you find out that you had ADD?
 -When I started in high school.

92
00:08:04.280 --> 00:08:11.200
It was not a socio -economically exposed area, but there were resources.

93
00:08:11.360 --> 00:08:17.480
The classmates usually sat on the lessons fully concentrated

94
00:08:17.640 --> 00:08:20.960
And they were committed and said things.

95
00:08:21.120 --> 00:08:26.160
One noticed that I could not follow instructions

96
00:08:26.320 --> 00:08:30.320
Even though I wanted and had the interest.

97
00:08:30.480 --> 00:08:33.160
Viktor, how was it for you

98
00:08:33.320 --> 00:08:39.600
When I was diagnosed, I was relieved.
 I knew I had something

99
00:08:39.760 --> 00:08:47.200
But the schools never wanted to investigate.
 I had to go in special classes.

100
00:08:47.360 --> 00:08:53.240
Why didn't they want to do anything?
 -They said it was a phase.

101
00:08:53.400 --> 00:08:58.800
Lucky you got extra lessons.
 -Fast it didn't help.

102
00:08:58.960 --> 00:09:05.040
But in high school I was old enough.
 There was no phase anymore.

103
00:09:05.200 --> 00:09:08.960
The investigation said I had ADHD.

104
00:09:09.120 --> 00:09:14.120
How did it feel?
 -I began to understand myself more.

105
00:09:14.280 --> 00:09:18.680
But a diagnosis is not so much fun.

106
00:09:18.840 --> 00:09:24.760
What did you think of others when you were told that you have ADD or ADHD

107
00:09:24.920 --> 00:09:30.520
What was the first thought?
 -It was both a relief and "damn!"

108
00:09:30.680 --> 00:09:37.640
Then you fall into their "you are a diagnosis child".

109
00:09:37.800 --> 00:09:43.800
Did you tell people around, or did you hold it to yourself

110
00:09:43.960 --> 00:09:51.360
In the beginning, I became worried about whether it would affect me in working life.

111
00:09:51.520 --> 00:09:54.920
"Will people think I'm stupid"

112
00:09:55.080 --> 00:10:02.440
Once you say it to someone, they can speak this way:

113
00:10:02.600 --> 00:10:06.080
"ADD, ie the disability"

114
00:10:06.240 --> 00:10:10.120
What "disability"

115
00:10:10.280 --> 00:10:16.840
You get a stamp, but I just have a little difficulty with the concentration.

116
00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:23.600
They say, "Why can't you sit still and don't blame your ADHD."

117
00:10:23.760 --> 00:10:26.840
But that is the thing.

118
00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:32.680
You do not want to blame it and explain.

119
00:10:32.840 --> 00:10:38.360
On some lessons ... I have a tendency to hit a snuff box

120
00:10:38.520 --> 00:10:44.000
Against my leg, which people disturb, apparently.

121
00:10:44.160 --> 00:10:50.360
"You may sit in that room with a link to what we are doing"

122
00:10:50.520 --> 00:10:53.680
"But you can do it safely."

123
00:10:53.840 --> 00:11:01.240
Then you get ostracized.
 I will be the problem, though I am not.

124
00:11:01.400 --> 00:11:05.120
Don't make us a problem.

125
00:11:05.280 --> 00:11:09.320
We just need a little extra help.

126
00:11:09.480 --> 00:11:14.120
When you are stuck, your thoughts come:

127
00:11:14.280 --> 00:11:18.360
"The lamp is gray, the carpet is black ..."

128
00:11:18.520 --> 00:11:25.000
You think of 500 other stuff.
 "What should I eat when I get home"

129
00:11:25.160 --> 00:11:28.600
Then you come nowhere.

130
00:11:28.760 --> 00:11:33.920
Some teachers do not understand.
 At school I lie after

131
00:11:34.080 --> 00:11:39.800
And then they say: "You've got these lessons on you."

132
00:11:39.960 --> 00:11:45.160
But I have a harder time taking things in and need more time

133
00:11:45.320 --> 00:11:49.880
But you only get these lessons.

134
00:11:50.040 --> 00:11:56.920
The problem is that teachers do not ask what kind of help you need.

135
00:11:57.080 --> 00:12:02.640
They just assume.
 -What did they do after your diagnosis?

136
00:12:02.800 --> 00:12:08.760
Then they only gave me extra time, but I couldn't focus anyway.

137
00:12:08.920 --> 00:12:15.680
I need someone who tells me, otherwise I just run around.

138
00:12:15.840 --> 00:12:21.640
I needed someone sitting next to it and wrote down the steps I would take.

139
00:12:21.800 --> 00:12:27.320
Did you feel any change when you had received your diagnosis

140
00:12:27.480 --> 00:12:30.520
For me it has been as before.

141
00:12:30.680 --> 00:12:37.080
I have not received anything positive from it more than I know for myself what I have.

142
00:12:37.240 --> 00:12:42.400
What would you like your teachers to do

143
00:12:42.560 --> 00:12:48.920
I need someone who understands me and who is genuine and trying to help

144
00:12:49.080 --> 00:12:52.080
And not just say "you have ADHD".

145
00:12:52.240 --> 00:12:58.400
Now we will talk myths and claims about ADD and ADHD.
 There are some

146
00:12:58.560 --> 00:13:04.360
As we were going to test with you now.
 We run "fact pingis".

147
00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:14.840
Clara comes in with ping pong rackets to you all.

148
00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:19.880
You see that it says "true" and "false" on them.

149
00:13:20.040 --> 00:13:25.320
I will give you five different claims

150
00:13:25.480 --> 00:13:29.680
And you respond true or falsely.

151
00:13:29.840 --> 00:13:32.440
Let's go.
 Number one:

152
00:13:32.600 --> 00:13:39.600
"You can't have ..." Wait, you might see the answer.
 The answer is here.

153
00:13:39.760 --> 00:13:45.680
"You can't have ADHD unless you are hyperactive."

154
00:13:45.840 --> 00:13:49.400
Do you hang with three, two, one, up.

155
00:13:49.560 --> 00:13:55.200
Everyone holds up.
 -"You better explain!"

156
00:13:55.360 --> 00:14:00.600
Am I right?
 -All responds "falsely" except Viktor.

157
00:14:00.760 --> 00:14:05.600
Why?
 -Add and ADHD are two different diagnoses.

158
00:14:05.760 --> 00:14:08.960
That's why I answered that way.

159
00:14:09.120 --> 00:14:15.960
What do you say is anyone who is a hundred that you are right?
 No?

160
00:14:16.120 --> 00:14:20.720
Do you guess - is there anyone who has any idea?

161
00:14:20.880 --> 00:14:26.880
Hyperactive is to run around, but some may be a little stressed

162
00:14:27.040 --> 00:14:33.400
And maybe fiddies with a pen.
 You don't have to be hyperactive.

163
00:14:33.560 --> 00:14:38.840
You need to move.
 -It is right.
 It's false.

164
00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:45.640
Hyperactivity is one of the symptoms.
 -The limit can be floating.

165
00:14:45.800 --> 00:14:48.880
There is a gray scale.

166
00:14:49.040 --> 00:14:52.480
Let's say someone is cleaning at home.

167
00:14:52.640 --> 00:14:59.480
One second they wash, but they do not make it clear, but go and vacuum.

168
00:14:59.640 --> 00:15:04.720
You do everything half -finished.
 -You find something to pill with.

169
00:15:04.880 --> 00:15:08.880
You clean and find something that shines.

170
00:15:09.040 --> 00:15:12.480
Are you ready for the next number two:

171
00:15:12.640 --> 00:15:19.800
"You can get ADHD of poor food and too much sugar."
 The diet can give ADHD.

172
00:15:20.920 --> 00:15:24.680
Damn people are determined here.

173
00:15:24.840 --> 00:15:27.600
Three, two, one, up.

174
00:15:29.440 --> 00:15:35.360
"You better explain!"
 -Now Vladimir can explain.

175
00:15:35.520 --> 00:15:39.040
I do not know.
 I think...

176
00:15:39.200 --> 00:15:46.200
I agree with a little neighbor.
 If you eat a lot of sugar, you get more energy

177
00:15:46.360 --> 00:15:51.960
As you have to get rid of, and then you are more hyperactive.

178
00:15:52.120 --> 00:15:58.800
But people with diagnoses usually already have the level of hyperactivity

179
00:15:58.960 --> 00:16:02.720
So food probably doesn't affect that much.

180
00:16:02.880 --> 00:16:05.520
False was right.

181
00:16:05.680 --> 00:16:11.520
You can get hyperactivity from sweets and poor diet, but not ADHD.

182
00:16:11.680 --> 00:16:17.680
They always said when I was little that I was crazy with sugar.

183
00:16:17.840 --> 00:16:23.040
For us with ADD ... I need sugar to work.

184
00:16:23.200 --> 00:16:28.640
When I can't concentrate, the sugar helps.

185
00:16:28.800 --> 00:16:35.640
"You can't get ADD and ADHD later in life."
 Three, two, one, run.

186
00:16:36.760 --> 00:16:39.880
Sorry.
 -"You better explain!"

187
00:16:40.040 --> 00:16:46.000
“You can't ...“ Decide.
 "You can't get it later in life."

188
00:16:46.760 --> 00:16:51.640
You change your mind.
 -That was what I meant.

189
00:16:51.800 --> 00:16:56.360
Can anyone explain?
 -It's...

190
00:16:56.520 --> 00:17:01.520
There is no age limit for when you can get it.

191
00:17:01.680 --> 00:17:07.240
It's about your psyche.
 It develops in your brain.

192
00:17:07.400 --> 00:17:12.760
It can come with age.
 -Add and adhd are born with.

193
00:17:12.920 --> 00:17:19.400
It can trigger, so you end up in investigation when you are older

194
00:17:19.560 --> 00:17:24.280
But ADD and ADHD you are born with.

195
00:17:24.440 --> 00:17:30.720
Can anyone pick up ... I don't have the sources.
 We can find out later.

196
00:17:30.880 --> 00:17:36.000
Write the sources down here, so people can read.

197
00:17:36.160 --> 00:17:43.120
But it is proven that you are born with it, then the symptoms can come later.

198
00:17:43.280 --> 00:17:47.200
That's what I meant anyway.

199
00:17:47.360 --> 00:17:52.480
This is right.
 -You would be right if you were wrong.

200
00:17:52.640 --> 00:17:58.240
It was fake I was thinking about.
 -We everyone was right.

201
00:17:58.400 --> 00:18:00.920
Listen carefully now.

202
00:18:01.080 --> 00:18:07.640
"Either you have ADHD, or not."
 There is nothing in between.

203
00:18:07.800 --> 00:18:11.800
This question was giant ... "what"

204
00:18:11.960 --> 00:18:18.840
Either you have ADHD, or not.
 There is nothing in between.

205
00:18:20.480 --> 00:18:24.240
Okay.
 You must not explain.
 You get.

206
00:18:24.400 --> 00:18:30.400
Nothing is black or white.
 After all, everyone has a fling of something.

207
00:18:30.560 --> 00:18:35.280
No one is perfect, and ADHD is gradually.

208
00:18:35.440 --> 00:18:42.160
Not having ADHD does not mean that you do not have any of the symptoms.

209
00:18:42.320 --> 00:18:47.520
So it says in the script.
 It's a gray scale

210
00:18:47.680 --> 00:18:51.480
Just like in many other diagnoses.

211
00:18:51.640 --> 00:18:57.520
Sometimes it can be difficult to draw the limit for where you are.

212
00:18:57.680 --> 00:19:02.560
Then we run the last.
 I don't know who is leading.

213
00:19:02.720 --> 00:19:06.880
It says the same.
 -Then there will be exclusion.

214
00:19:07.040 --> 00:19:09.600
Number five:

215
00:19:09.760 --> 00:19:17.000
"ADD and ADHD are new diagnoses that are increasingly used on messy children."

216
00:19:17.160 --> 00:19:20.240
Three, two, one ...

217
00:19:21.960 --> 00:19:25.480
Nour?
 -Take the question again.

218
00:19:25.640 --> 00:19:32.160
"ADD and ADHD are new diagnoses that are increasingly used on messy children."

219
00:19:32.320 --> 00:19:39.480
Yes, because nowadays it feels like you just throw on ADHD on children

220
00:19:39.640 --> 00:19:44.200
As soon as they can't concentrate.

221
00:19:44.360 --> 00:19:51.600
It may be because something is boring and that they don't like what they do

222
00:19:51.760 --> 00:19:56.920
But the teachers can directly judge-

223
00:19:57.080 --> 00:20:04.320
That the child has ADHD because of it, so I definitely think ...

224
00:20:04.480 --> 00:20:09.120
What are you doing?
 What do you answer?
 -Sant.

225
00:20:09.280 --> 00:20:12.960
Okay.
 Why do you answer falsely?

226
00:20:13.120 --> 00:20:18.800
I do not feel that people use it as an apology

227
00:20:18.960 --> 00:20:24.960
And says you have ADHD when you run around.
 I see it as so-

228
00:20:25.120 --> 00:20:30.440
That an investigation is required to find out.

229
00:20:30.600 --> 00:20:36.360
You are right.
 The reason for more diagnosed

230
00:20:36.520 --> 00:20:43.720
is that there is a lot of research and that you now know how someone with ADHD

231
00:20:43.880 --> 00:20:50.520
behaves, and the diagnosis has been around for over 50 years.

232
00:20:50.680 --> 00:20:55.760
You were right.
 I have a rash issue now.

233
00:20:55.920 --> 00:21:01.600
Do you want to win?
 It doesn't look that way.
 -I am stressed.

234
00:21:02.760 --> 00:21:06.200
I will give you a question

235
00:21:06.360 --> 00:21:13.840
And in case you have a guess, answer, but you only get one attempt.

236
00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:21.360
"How many percent of the adult population is estimated to have ADHD"

237
00:21:21.520 --> 00:21:25.840
What counts as an adult?
 -Over eighteen.

238
00:21:26.000 --> 00:21:31.200
How many percent of ... -9 percent.

239
00:21:31.360 --> 00:21:35.560
Okay.
 -Don't check me!

240
00:21:35.720 --> 00:21:40.160
-—-—-

241
00:21:40.320 --> 00:21:42.960
-—-—-

242
00:21:44.920 --> 00:21:47.560
-—-—-

243
00:21:47.720 --> 00:21:51.360
Should I also say 25.

244
00:21:52.720 --> 00:21:57.280
Far from ... -Are you what you said?

245
00:21:57.440 --> 00:22:00.120
You said 9.

246
00:22:00.280 --> 00:22:02.280
-—-—-

247
00:22:02.440 --> 00:22:05.360
-—-—-

248
00:22:05.520 --> 00:22:11.560
"None of those there."
 -For loud, but Vladimir was closest.

249
00:22:11.720 --> 00:22:15.840
2.5 percent is the correct answer.

250
00:22:16.000 --> 00:22:20.120
The winner here comes a trophy.

251
00:22:21.440 --> 00:22:24.080
An applause to Vladimir

252
00:22:25.840 --> 00:22:29.560
First prize.
 -Get you?

253
00:22:29.720 --> 00:22:33.160
Obvious.
 It's just sharing.

254
00:22:33.320 --> 00:22:37.760
Okay.
 -I thought it was 6 or 3.

255
00:22:37.920 --> 00:22:42.720
I thought 5, but said 10. -This with school ...

256
00:22:42.880 --> 00:22:49.200
You who have received extra help, how was it received by other students

257
00:22:49.360 --> 00:22:53.560
They were treated differently.
 -How?

258
00:22:53.720 --> 00:22:59.520
I could get comments from others that I went to school with.

259
00:22:59.680 --> 00:23:06.800
"Why can she sit in another room" "Why does she get more help?"

260
00:23:06.960 --> 00:23:12.080
"But I'm much harder to do this."

261
00:23:12.240 --> 00:23:19.720
"You may also have a hard time with focus, but I have a mentally difficult."

262
00:23:19.880 --> 00:23:25.000
Explained the teachers to the students what you had

263
00:23:25.160 --> 00:23:28.840
They said, "She's a spec child!"

264
00:23:29.000 --> 00:23:35.000
What do you want teachers to do for you How do you wish them to be?

265
00:23:35.160 --> 00:23:40.520
That they should be more understanding and want to help.

266
00:23:40.680 --> 00:23:47.640
If they do not want to, then you do not take it.
 They just do it for the money.

267
00:23:47.800 --> 00:23:55.280
It doesn't feel genuine.
 When you got help, how was it received in class

268
00:23:56.200 --> 00:24:00.520
Type you got extra time on the tests

269
00:24:00.680 --> 00:24:05.800
They think you are left behind.

270
00:24:05.960 --> 00:24:09.720
It was not taken well

271
00:24:09.880 --> 00:24:14.600
But you have to stand up for yourself and explain.

272
00:24:14.760 --> 00:24:21.840
Vladimir, you plug in university.
 How does it differ from high school

273
00:24:22.000 --> 00:24:29.200
There is a greater responsibility on one's self to make sure everything has done.

274
00:24:29.360 --> 00:24:36.440
You do not get the same backing as in high school and elementary school.

275
00:24:36.600 --> 00:24:42.120
One has its own responsibility to find out their rights

276
00:24:42.280 --> 00:24:45.080
And how to get them satisfied.

277
00:24:45.240 --> 00:24:48.600
Thus a student who records for you

278
00:24:48.760 --> 00:24:52.640
Or one with whom you have lectures.

279
00:24:52.800 --> 00:24:56.760
Then one must tell you about their needs

280
00:24:56.920 --> 00:25:01.160
Instead of just getting support.

281
00:25:01.320 --> 00:25:05.680
How does it feel to have to take the extras step

282
00:25:05.840 --> 00:25:09.720
I have tried to explain to the class

283
00:25:09.880 --> 00:25:15.520
But haven't really dared to tell, because it feels strange.

284
00:25:15.680 --> 00:25:21.800
Many people think that those with ADHD and ADD are "losers"

285
00:25:21.960 --> 00:25:28.680
But then many people do not see those who are actually very smart.

286
00:25:28.840 --> 00:25:34.840
My friend has ADHD, but plugs into a civil engineer.
 She may be hyper

287
00:25:35.000 --> 00:25:38.960
But she does what she should and can.

288
00:25:39.120 --> 00:25:44.920
When doing the investigation they see that you are often over -gifted

289
00:25:45.080 --> 00:25:48.680
And as well as "over average".

290
00:25:48.840 --> 00:25:55.880
It leads into my question.
 Have you heard the word "superpower" used

291
00:25:56.040 --> 00:26:03.400
From my psychologist I have been told, when I was diagnosed with the diagnosis

292
00:26:03.560 --> 00:26:07.280
That I have a good pattern memory.

293
00:26:07.440 --> 00:26:11.840
I can memorize incredible amounts.

294
00:26:12.000 --> 00:26:18.320
When doing the investigation they show a picture to memorize

295
00:26:18.480 --> 00:26:25.600
And then put out on time.
 I do well because of the "superpower".

296
00:26:25.760 --> 00:26:29.600
No local mind, memory, forgetful ...

297
00:26:29.760 --> 00:26:33.560
I have no local mind, just patterns.

298
00:26:33.720 --> 00:26:40.520
Have you heard "Super Power" used when describing ADD and ADHD

299
00:26:40.680 --> 00:26:44.560
It is very difficult to know.

300
00:26:44.720 --> 00:26:51.720
You do not know if it is because of the ADD or because you can do this.

301
00:26:51.880 --> 00:26:59.160
At least I know a thing you saw in the diagnostic test.

302
00:26:59.320 --> 00:27:05.440
I am quick -thinking and can take it as a superpower.

303
00:27:06.400 --> 00:27:13.880
But the concentration pulls down on ... -it becomes harder to learn things.

304
00:27:14.040 --> 00:27:20.360
May it feel problematic that many people use the word “superpower”

305
00:27:20.520 --> 00:27:24.160
To describe ADHD as something nice?

306
00:27:24.320 --> 00:27:29.760
It's a good thing.
 -It glorifies the diagnosis.

307
00:27:29.920 --> 00:27:33.520
But you have your "ups and downs".

308
00:27:33.680 --> 00:27:40.480
Once you have it it feels good, but when you have dips, it sucks.

309
00:27:40.640 --> 00:27:46.680
How about those who don't feel at all they have a superpower

310
00:27:46.840 --> 00:27:50.160
You just become more "specborn".

311
00:27:50.320 --> 00:27:56.480
Speaking of music.
 You were part of a competing TV channel music program.

312
00:27:56.640 --> 00:28:02.880
We do not mention any names.
 How was it then affected the ADHD in any way?

313
00:28:03.040 --> 00:28:08.200
The ADHD helped me very much through my journey.

314
00:28:08.360 --> 00:28:14.760
It took me down in a way that I just let all my feelings fly out.

315
00:28:14.920 --> 00:28:20.520
The ADHD helped me, because I was always ahead.

316
00:28:20.680 --> 00:28:24.040
Without the ADHD I would have given up

317
00:28:24.200 --> 00:28:31.560
But now I pushed myself to the end.
 I had a goal and drove on.

318
00:28:31.720 --> 00:28:36.960
It was something I love, and there the ADHD also kicks in.

319
00:28:37.120 --> 00:28:41.160
If you love something you go "all in".

320
00:28:41.320 --> 00:28:46.720
One last thing I wonder is what you have for tips

321
00:28:46.880 --> 00:28:53.480
To someone who goes through an investigation or who has just been diagnosed?

322
00:28:53.640 --> 00:28:57.760
Find out your rights.

323
00:28:58.480 --> 00:29:04.680
There is a lot that I do not know about, but there are rights I can get.

324
00:29:04.840 --> 00:29:09.920
And also to ask what there is for tools.

325
00:29:10.080 --> 00:29:15.320
What can I get to make it easier for me in everyday life

326
00:29:15.480 --> 00:29:21.400
Great tips.
 Find out your rights, "Embrace it" and drive.

327
00:29:21.560 --> 00:29:28.040
Thanks.
