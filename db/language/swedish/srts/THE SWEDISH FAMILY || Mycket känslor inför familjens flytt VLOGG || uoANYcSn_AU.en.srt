1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:02,603
Soon we move home to Sweden.

2
00:00:02,936 --> 00:00:04,671
That's the problem.

3
00:00:04,880 --> 00:00:09,008
And we are very embarrassing, often, and take nothing for the most part.

4
00:00:09,174 --> 00:00:11,128
Just.
 You should not be allowed to come in.

5
00:00:11,276 --> 00:00:12,544
And when we were going ...

6
00:00:12,610 --> 00:00:14,657
(Fart)

7
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,522
Welcome to our home.

8
00:00:26,855 --> 00:00:29,023
It is a very ordinary Sunday.

9
00:00:29,190 --> 00:00:31,525
A pretty messy Sunday.

10
00:00:32,050 --> 00:00:34,962
We read a book there ...

11
00:00:35,173 --> 00:00:36,363
Pink!

12
00:00:36,520 --> 00:00:38,898
- Yes, it's pink.
 - Pink!

13
00:00:38,965 --> 00:00:42,034
It is text and then it is a picture, so you should say ...

14
00:00:42,101 --> 00:00:46,337
On the chairs.
 Under the bed.
 On the cabinet.

15
00:00:46,404 --> 00:00:49,606
Yes ... Laura thinks it's great fun.

16
00:00:49,673 --> 00:00:55,344
But I think you should clean a little, Laura.
 Check out what she has stocked for here.

17
00:00:56,012 --> 00:00:58,547
It looks awful.

18
00:00:58,614 --> 00:01:05,019
- huh?
 I read it.
 - Yes, you want to read it.
 Matilda Mouse builds.

19
00:01:05,352 --> 00:01:08,355
Those two would also need to clean a little.

20
00:01:12,800 --> 00:01:14,960
- HÃ¶rrni.
 - Mm?

21
00:01:15,093 --> 00:01:18,029
What do your rooms look like?

22
00:01:19,430 --> 00:01:21,365
Quite clean.

23
00:01:21,699 --> 00:01:25,668
Ehm ... mine is not cleaned at all.

24
00:01:26,002 --> 00:01:32,841
Okay.
 I think it's time for us to make a jerk.
 A cleaner.

25
00:01:33,008 --> 00:01:37,538
- Oh no.
 - No, it's so boring.

26
00:01:38,011 --> 00:01:41,481
Yes, but then we can start the day ago, for real.

27
00:01:41,614 --> 00:01:43,482
Okay then.

28
00:01:45,517 --> 00:01:52,156
Have you talked anything about Alma's braids?
 So, the viewers have not seen.

29
00:01:52,223 --> 00:01:57,494
- Don't they have?
 God.
 - No.
 This is one of the last things you did in Kenya.

30
00:01:57,560 --> 00:01:59,228
Yes exactly.

31
00:01:59,362 --> 00:02:03,365
- And it took how long?
 - Four and a half hours.

32
00:02:03,498 --> 00:02:07,935
Now you have had them for a while, so the real hair is starting to look out.

33
00:02:08,069 --> 00:02:13,540
After all, it does not have such a long life.
 You don't really have the right hair quality to do this here.

34
00:02:13,606 --> 00:02:19,678
No, my hair will probably be very worn when I take them out, but I think it's worth it.
 I think they are very nice.

35
00:02:19,745 --> 00:02:21,746
You fit in that.

36
00:02:21,813 --> 00:02:27,951
It's really good I look at you and think I see someone else.
 Especially from behind.

37
00:02:28,084 --> 00:02:29,400
Only...

38
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:34,823
Long, long blonde braids.
 It gets wrong connected as well.

39
00:02:34,890 --> 00:02:38,226
I agree with.
 And what is it like to sleep with those, then?

40
00:02:38,293 --> 00:02:42,362
- Very difficult.
 I can show what I sleep with.
 - Yes.

41
00:02:51,385 --> 00:02:56,173
- This is the one I have on, and ... - What is it?

42
00:02:56,340 --> 00:03:01,344
A silk cap.
 I can show what it looks like.

43
00:03:06,015 --> 00:03:12,019
- Mushrooms.
 - Yes, you look like the worst little mushroom.

44
00:03:16,356 --> 00:03:20,309
And then I sleep with this one.
 Like this.

45
00:03:21,193 --> 00:03:25,697
So they're not everywhere.
 Great.

46
00:03:25,764 --> 00:03:30,525
- It will be like an extra pillow.
 - Yes, though not so nice pillow.

47
00:03:30,767 --> 00:03:32,669
No, I want it.

48
00:03:32,802 --> 00:03:37,740
But it is always when we are cleaning.
 Then you suddenly have the toys and play with them.

49
00:03:37,806 --> 00:03:39,408
Then it will not be cleaned.

50
00:03:39,474 --> 00:03:42,744
Play it, play it ...

51
00:03:46,826 --> 00:03:49,200
The eternal pacifier.

52
00:03:56,488 --> 00:03:58,440
Away.

53
00:03:59,290 --> 00:04:01,625
No.
 Not there.

54
00:04:01,759 --> 00:04:03,360
Not there.

55
00:04:11,433 --> 00:04:17,605
Laura, that destroys the teeth.
 You have to stop it.
 Thats how it is.

56
00:04:54,901 --> 00:05:01,006
Now I'm going to go home to a classmate who will have a birthday party.

57
00:05:01,172 --> 00:05:05,897
- And I'll just follow you there.
 - Yes exactly.
 You should not be allowed to come in.

58
00:05:05,943 --> 00:05:09,346
- No no.
 And neither do you.
 - No, neither do you.

59
00:05:09,412 --> 00:05:13,549
This one ... I thought I would carry the camera in it when we were not filming.

60
00:05:13,627 --> 00:05:16,230
Now it is completely empty and just lumpy.

61
00:05:16,280 --> 00:05:17,419
Flying around.

62
00:05:17,485 --> 00:05:22,222
- Yes, but it is cleaned at home and Alma is going to be at a party.
 - Yes.

63
00:05:22,319 --> 00:05:27,527
"Yes!"
 Lovely Sunday!
 What kind of gift do you have?

64
00:05:27,693 --> 00:05:33,898
I have this ... little bag.
 I had no nice bag, so ...

65
00:05:33,973 --> 00:05:35,233
- You made one.
 - It's a little worn.

66
00:05:35,303 --> 00:05:41,471
- Yes, but you drew a little nice on it.
 - Yes.
 I bought some necessity in necessity.

67
00:05:41,538 --> 00:05:45,741
- Several necessities.
 - Yes.
 In nice color.

68
00:05:45,941 --> 00:05:47,840
Oh.

69
00:05:49,204 --> 00:05:52,013
And ... God, sorry.

70
00:05:52,213 --> 00:05:54,848
And a bath bomb.

71
00:05:55,182 --> 00:05:56,750
"Yes!"

72
00:06:00,019 --> 00:06:04,289
- Oh, should they jump?
 Do you think they dare?
 - Yes.

73
00:06:04,356 --> 00:06:06,291
Do you think so?

74
00:06:06,491 --> 00:06:09,527
Oh, what a brave!

75
00:06:12,162 --> 00:06:17,867
Laura goes through a very emotional period in her life right now.

76
00:06:18,033 --> 00:06:25,606
She should stop with a diaper and she will end up with a pacifier, and she wants to dress all herself.

77
00:06:25,673 --> 00:06:28,342
- She wants to do everything herself.
 - Yes.

78
00:06:28,412 --> 00:06:31,210
Oh, what do you want?
 A banana?
 Or apple?

79
00:06:31,277 --> 00:06:33,679
Yes, you can take the apple.

80
00:06:33,746 --> 00:06:37,215
And is it that you try to help her,-

81
00:06:37,300 --> 00:06:42,286
-Then she usually lays on the floor and roll around and scream everything she has.

82
00:06:42,486 --> 00:06:51,827
So it is our everyday life right now and I think that is many ... toddler parents' everyday lives for periods.

83
00:06:51,960 --> 00:06:54,819
It is quite natural.
 But...

84
00:06:55,570 --> 00:07:06,005
We have been given the chance to test an app called Peppy Pals.
 It is filled with games for children between 2 and 8 years.

85
00:07:06,071 --> 00:07:10,608
Games and situations, huh?
 You help these peppy friends.

86
00:07:10,675 --> 00:07:15,012
- Exactly.
 In the app there are a few different friends.
 - Animals ...

87
00:07:15,079 --> 00:07:17,280
- My turn!
 - Oh, sorry.
 Sorry.

88
00:07:17,347 --> 00:07:18,281
Mm.
 "Here we go."

89
00:07:18,361 --> 00:07:22,951
- My turn!
 - Yes, sorry.
 Sorry.
 We get to play again.

90
00:07:23,352 --> 00:07:25,553
Laura really likes that game.

91
00:07:25,620 --> 00:07:28,222
Yes, she thinks it is great fun.

92
00:07:28,289 --> 00:07:34,828
You can ask her nice questions about friends when they help each other, comfort each other,-

93
00:07:34,894 --> 00:07:38,230
-or when they get angry, or when they get happy.

94
00:07:38,297 --> 00:07:43,334
The app will practice children's EQ - emotional intelligence.

95
00:07:43,401 --> 00:07:46,937
Yes.
 And it is also filled with a lot of other games.

96
00:07:47,004 --> 00:07:50,807
You can draw and you can puzzle.
 You can do lots of things.

97
00:07:50,885 --> 00:07:57,746
And it is completely child -proof.
 There is no third -party advertising in it.

98
00:07:58,013 --> 00:08:02,100
And yes, it is safe simply.

99
00:08:03,017 --> 00:08:08,303
- What happens now, Laura?
 - Oh, now they ride on a choice.
 Gosh!

100
00:08:08,955 --> 00:08:16,827
"How did Gabby feel when they were criticized?"
 Then there will be some discussion material.

101
00:08:16,894 --> 00:08:22,165
He might get angry.
 Or sorry?
 He was sad.

102
00:08:22,298 --> 00:08:24,967
Or they were sad, they say.

103
00:08:25,067 --> 00:08:30,338
- Yes, the animals are gender neutral.
 - Exactly.
 All the characters are gender neutral in this app.

104
00:08:30,472 --> 00:08:31,606
RED.

105
00:08:31,739 --> 00:08:33,007
Green.

106
00:08:36,480 --> 00:08:40,947
We have an offer for you who may want to test Peppy Pals.

107
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:47,218
14 days free trial period, then the app costs 39 \ Hkronor a month.

108
00:08:47,285 --> 00:08:51,088
You can cancel at any time, there is no binding time.

109
00:08:51,221 --> 00:08:56,210
Follow the link at the top of the video text and download the app and test.

110
00:08:58,294 --> 00:09:06,533
Grandma comes over and greets from Sweden to Portugal, so I will pick some flowers.

111
00:09:07,167 --> 00:09:12,720
It is so wonderful that it is November but that there are still flowers here.

112
00:09:13,880 --> 00:09:16,275
Oh, check out.

113
00:09:16,341 --> 00:09:18,476
- Nice!
 - This one was fine.

114
00:09:18,543 --> 00:09:22,146
Take a few and we can put them in a vase in the guest room.

115
00:09:23,347 --> 00:09:25,282
How does it feel that she is coming, then?

116
00:09:25,348 --> 00:09:27,350
It feels great.

117
00:09:27,417 --> 00:09:34,622
She has kind of been my best friend since I was two years old, so it's great fun that she comes.

118
00:09:34,756 --> 00:09:37,024
Now I'm going to pick a lot of flowers.

119
00:09:37,091 --> 00:09:43,907
Oh!
 Check out, the flowers fall off.
 These are really sensitive flowers.

120
00:09:44,297 --> 00:09:47,299
It will be difficult to carry them only.

121
00:09:47,433 --> 00:09:53,040
But here you have a very nice bush you can take from.

122
00:09:58,675 --> 00:10:04,146
Soon we move home to Sweden.
 How does it feel?

123
00:10:04,213 --> 00:10:06,414
It feels very bad.

124
00:10:06,481 --> 00:10:12,219
So damn good friends here, and ... now I have to move home as well.

125
00:10:12,286 --> 00:10:16,689
Hope I find good friends in Sweden.

126
00:10:16,956 --> 00:10:20,440
Don't have them left before, then?

127
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:24,962
Well ... I have.

128
00:10:25,496 --> 00:10:33,336
- But you should change school.
 - Yes exactly.
 So ... that's the problem.

129
00:10:33,869 --> 00:10:38,673
- I think it will go great, Harry.
 - Mm, may hope.

130
00:10:38,835 --> 00:10:42,610
Come on we can collect some more flowers down there by the meadow.

131
00:10:42,676 --> 00:10:44,011
Okay.

132
00:10:54,219 --> 00:10:57,960
Here it was most green, not so much flowers.

133
00:10:58,089 --> 00:11:02,759
- Yes, a small flower.
 - It was small.
 Unlucky.

134
00:11:06,195 --> 00:11:07,696
Where are you going now, then?

135
00:11:07,763 --> 00:11:14,780
Away there.
 I'm going to take one of those flowers, because I'm really not sure if you can take away.

136
00:11:19,489 --> 00:11:25,343
If you had been able to choose, would the family lived here in Lisbon then?

137
00:11:25,477 --> 00:11:28,148
Easy.
 Yes.

138
00:11:34,351 --> 00:11:36,301
- So!
 - Nice!

139
00:11:36,368 --> 00:11:38,420
Now I have all the flowers!

140
00:11:39,488 --> 00:11:41,556
This is our guest room.

141
00:11:41,623 --> 00:11:46,227
It is located at the bottom of the house next to the garage which is behind this wall.

142
00:11:46,293 --> 00:11:48,962
Down here we usually do not film so often.

143
00:11:49,029 --> 00:11:52,298
No, but we are very happy to have it.
 The guest room.

144
00:11:52,365 --> 00:11:57,202
Yes of course.
 And now we are preparing for Grandma's arrival.

145
00:11:57,269 --> 00:11:58,270
Yes.

146
00:11:58,336 --> 00:12:01,539
I don't like this quilt at all because it's a double blanket.

147
00:12:01,606 --> 00:12:04,942
It is very Portuguese.
 Incredibly difficult.

148
00:12:05,008 --> 00:12:08,678
It's a two -man job, but I'm standing with the camera so I can't do much.

149
00:12:08,745 --> 00:12:11,146
Two -man jobs and two -man blankets.

150
00:12:11,280 --> 00:12:16,951
It struck me when I was out now with Harry and picked some flowers ...

151
00:12:17,050 --> 00:12:20,287
There will be the emotions on this vlog.

152
00:12:20,354 --> 00:12:21,288
Will it be?

153
00:12:21,355 --> 00:12:25,995
Yes, because it's not just Laura who has a lot of emotions.
 Harry has a lot of emotions.

154
00:12:26,092 --> 00:12:29,027
- Yes, we all have.
 - He would prefer to stay here.

155
00:12:29,094 --> 00:12:33,030
He will change school when he moves home to Sweden.
 So he has a lot of thoughts right now.

156
00:12:33,164 --> 00:12:37,234
And Alma, who is and party now ...

157
00:12:37,367 --> 00:12:43,405
She also has lots of emotions.
 She is very "pre-teen."
 You don't see that, but then ...

158
00:12:43,472 --> 00:12:45,007
We see it.

159
00:12:45,073 --> 00:12:49,477
And we are very embarrassing, often, and take nothing for the most part.

160
00:12:49,544 --> 00:12:52,412
Yes.
 According to her, then.

161
00:12:52,479 --> 00:12:59,510
So what I mean is that our family is currently going through a lot of "emotions."
 A lot of feelings.

162
00:12:59,570 --> 00:13:04,289
- Now you released?
 - Yes, sorry.
 Now there were more emotions here.

163
00:13:04,633 --> 00:13:05,623
Yes.

164
00:13:05,690 --> 00:13:12,295
But I think that ... that's what it is in families.
 But right now it is a lot for us.

165
00:13:12,362 --> 00:13:16,632
Yes, and it is not less because we are approaching home.

166
00:13:16,698 --> 00:13:20,835
- No.
 It's not just a trip.
 Home move.
 - Yes exactly.

167
00:13:21,002 --> 00:13:23,470
How do you feel about it, then?

168
00:13:23,604 --> 00:13:27,207
I think it will be fun.
 It will be fun with a fresh start.

169
00:13:27,273 --> 00:13:34,679
I miss Sweden and my friends and friends and the family and as well as partners at home in Sweden.

170
00:13:35,013 --> 00:13:42,485
I think it will be great to come home to a winter landscape.
 Hope there is snow in Sweden when we get home.

171
00:13:42,686 --> 00:13:45,421
- In some places it always does.
 - Yes.

172
00:13:45,488 --> 00:13:50,559
- Maybe not in Stockholm.
 - No.
 We'll see.
 How do you feel, then?

173
00:13:50,692 --> 00:13:59,499
I hate darkness, which our faithful viewers know.
 So I'm not so happy to move home this season.

174
00:13:59,566 --> 00:14:04,210
No.
 We really move home the most fun time of the year.

175
00:14:04,269 --> 00:14:06,404
- he says ironically.
 - Yes.

176
00:14:06,490 --> 00:14:12,609
- But ... we have a lot of exciting things happening in Sweden in the future.
 - mm.

177
00:14:12,676 --> 00:14:17,480
So that way I look forward to it well.
 And of course friends and family.
 But I love to live here.

178
00:14:17,547 --> 00:14:18,814
Yes.

179
00:14:18,948 --> 00:14:23,170
"Mixed Emotions."
 Mixed feelings.

180
00:15:28,069 --> 00:15:31,240
I have taken out my hair.

181
00:15:32,006 --> 00:15:33,607
Taken out the braids.

182
00:15:33,690 --> 00:15:39,411
Yes exactly.
 But I have taken out the fake hair, and it was much more than this.

183
00:15:39,478 --> 00:15:44,692
But I haven't been able to throw this yet.
 I threw like half.

184
00:15:45,349 --> 00:15:52,488
It's been a few days since we last filmed.
 You took out your hair - or, the braids - yesterday.

185
00:15:52,555 --> 00:15:56,158
Yes exactly.
 I got help from a friend.

186
00:15:56,225 --> 00:16:01,362
But my hair is actually very worn now, up here and so.

187
00:16:01,429 --> 00:16:04,565
But it wasn't as bad as I thought it would be.

188
00:16:04,631 --> 00:16:09,535
No, but also, they were quite difficult and limiting.

189
00:16:09,602 --> 00:16:14,806
I have quite a lot of activities so it was difficult to walk on them with the braids.

190
00:16:14,873 --> 00:16:17,341
Yes.
 Most difficult to get on the swimming hat, huh?

191
00:16:17,410 --> 00:16:24,681
(Laura screams in the background) Yes.
 I go swimming and we have to have a swim hat, and it was very difficult to get on.

192
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:31,906
Is Laura a little sad?

193
00:16:32,954 --> 00:16:39,159
Yes ... no more than usual.
 But there is a little crisis and panic here sometimes.

194
00:16:39,250 --> 00:16:40,093
Yes.

195
00:16:40,450 --> 00:16:43,629
After all, there was a little crisis and panic on Sunday.

196
00:16:43,696 --> 00:16:48,833
When we picked you up from the party we went to the beach, and when ...

197
00:16:48,967 --> 00:16:51,219
(Fart)

198
00:16:52,666 --> 00:16:55,472
- It was not me.
 - Neither do I.

199
00:16:55,570 --> 00:16:59,348
Laura ... Worst chainsaw.

200
00:17:00,476 --> 00:17:07,414
When we were filming there ... talk to the camera, that is.
 Not just film that we bathed.

201
00:17:07,481 --> 00:17:11,351
Then the battery ran out so it actually got a little trouble.

202
00:17:11,418 --> 00:17:13,152
- Yes.
 - Yes.

203
00:17:13,286 --> 00:17:17,022
So now Harry felt today: "I don't want to film."

204
00:17:17,089 --> 00:17:17,956
But it is okay.

205
00:17:18,023 --> 00:17:19,958
- It is okay.
 - Sometimes you have to take a break.

206
00:17:20,024 --> 00:17:24,695
- Yes then.
 You have the right to have your feelings, right?
 - Yes.

207
00:17:24,762 --> 00:17:29,640
- There were the emotions on this vlog, Alma.
 - Yes indeed.

208
00:17:30,032 --> 00:17:35,670
- And then I can take the opportunity to remind you of the offer.
 - Yes, check it out.
 At the top of the video text.

209
00:17:35,737 --> 00:17:36,871
The link.

210
00:17:36,938 --> 00:17:42,142
We have a question of the day.
 Where should we celebrate Christmas somewhere?

211
00:17:42,275 --> 00:17:48,681
- Here.
 Here in Portugal we will celebrate Christmas.
 - Yes.
 Probably here in this living room.

212
00:17:48,814 --> 00:17:50,348
Yes.

213
00:17:50,690 --> 00:17:54,380
And then we go to Sweden sometime around New Year, we think.

214
00:17:54,410 --> 00:17:55,380
- Yes.
 - Exactly.

215
00:17:55,410 --> 00:18:00,890
We have not decided whether to celebrate at home in Sweden.
 New Year, that is.
 Or if we are going to celebrate New Year here.

216
00:18:00,957 --> 00:18:05,430
- No, but something will be.
 - Yes.
 We'll see.

217
00:18:05,627 --> 00:18:07,962
Where are you going to celebrate Christmas anywhere?

218
00:18:08,096 --> 00:18:13,834

219
00:18:14,067 --> 00:18:20,873

Comment, ask questions and have a great time until we see you next time.

222
00:18:31,481 --> 00:18:32,082
See you.

223
00:18:32,157 --> 00:18:34,517
Bye!
