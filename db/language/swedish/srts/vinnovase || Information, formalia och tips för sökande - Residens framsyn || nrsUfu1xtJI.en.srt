00:00:00.840 --> 00:00:04.310
Hi, my name is Erik BorÃ¤lv and am one of the administrators who

2
00:00:04.310 --> 00:00:07.370
Works with this announcement about the residence's foresight.

3
00:00:08.070 --> 00:00:12.624
I will tell you a little bit about what the call is all about

4
00:00:12.624 --> 00:00:14.790
How you as an applicant can think.

5
00:00:17.650 --> 00:00:22.180
Residence is an established concept, especially in culture

6
00:00:22.180 --> 00:00:26.710
and the creative world where one uses it to invite

7
00:00:26.710 --> 00:00:30.626
artists and other creators to different types of

8
00:00:30.626 --> 00:00:35.616
businesses.
 We borrow the concept and then try to use this

9
00:00:35.616 --> 00:00:39.840
A little then for innovation and above all the foresight.

10
00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:44.233
And it is about the care organization, the coordinator,

11
00:00:44.233 --> 00:00:48.054
offers a place for this person to help

12
00:00:48.054 --> 00:00:50.870
The organization to be better at the forefront.

13
00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:57.880
A central feature is that one is invited to the inside of one

14
00:00:57.880 --> 00:01:02.891
business and that you are part of the business and get to take part

15
00:01:02.891 --> 00:01:04.800
out of the interior of the business.

16
00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:09.460
So the place and the interior is a key factor.

17
00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:14.821
It is not just the organization that will be better at the forefront,

18
00:01:14.821 --> 00:01:18.268
but also people who perform the foresight should also win

19
00:01:18.268 --> 00:01:22.162
something on this by getting a chance to apply

20
00:01:22.162 --> 00:01:25.290
their skills in a new world, a new area.

21
00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:32.205
Since we are Vinnova and the Innovation Authority in Sweden

22
00:01:32.205 --> 00:01:36.815
so is it important to us that this stay is relevant

23
00:01:36.815 --> 00:01:40.821
for innovation and we usually say that if one understands

24
00:01:40.821 --> 00:01:45.659
the future a little better or the possible future a little better so

25
00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:50.496
Do you get better at leading from the future and that is why we

26
00:01:50.496 --> 00:01:54.199
Have interest in this particular residence.

27
00:01:56.970 --> 00:02:02.070
After a completed project, we wish that the organization as

28
00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:06.766
is worth better should be able to formulate a strategy for those when

29
00:02:06.766 --> 00:02:12.028
This applies to various future issues and this may apply to technology.
 The

30
00:02:12.028 --> 00:02:16.804
may apply to community development or other types of risks

31
00:02:16.804 --> 00:02:20.610
As he imagines may come in the future.

32
00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:26.089
We wish the person who makes the residence to have been allowed to apply

33
00:02:26.089 --> 00:02:30.018
their skills and learned something by having received

34
00:02:30.018 --> 00:02:32.950
Access to 1 new location and a new business.

35
00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:38.211
And we hope this will be medially or communicative

36
00:02:38.211 --> 00:02:42.175
in the sense that others can be inspired and take part in

37
00:02:42.175 --> 00:02:42.940
The result.

38
00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:47.620
Something short about formalia then

39
00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:51.850
Anyone seeking it should be the municipality, region or authority.

40
00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:55.730
You seek as a lone organization.

41
00:02:57.190 --> 00:03:01.582
In the application, one should then also describe this person who

42
00:03:01.582 --> 00:03:06.413
performed the residence.
 The person who then has skills in foresight.

43
00:03:06.413 --> 00:03:10.878
It is a person you have the task of finding, identifying

44
00:03:10.878 --> 00:03:15.563
and describe and that person is also part of the assessment late

45
00:03:15.563 --> 00:03:17.760
Then the assessment process itself.

46
00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:23.137
When we look at the applications.
 There are different ways to

47
00:03:23.137 --> 00:03:27.030
engage that person if one hires a person on something

48
00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:30.655
way then a wage cost arises if you buy a

49
00:03:30.655 --> 00:03:34.951
service so it becomes a different type of cost and you who are accustomed

50
00:03:34.951 --> 00:03:38.979
To specify costs in brinova applications just understand that

51
00:03:38.979 --> 00:03:42.470
These are different types of costs then in their budget.

52
00:03:44.710 --> 00:03:49.270
It's just one person we are looking for per residence.

53
00:03:50.330 --> 00:03:54.364
The entire project can be up to 8 months.
 We want this one

54
00:03:54.364 --> 00:03:57.390
The residence should be one to 3 months optimally.

55
00:03:59.950 --> 00:04:03.773
In the call text Chapter 7, all our

56
00:04:03.773 --> 00:04:08.979
assessment criteria.
 The things we rate and judge when we

57
00:04:08.979 --> 00:04:13.941
receives applications.
 So it's good to read on and then as well as

58
00:04:13.941 --> 00:04:18.658
Work backwards from the outside.
 Those assessment criteria when one

59
00:04:18.658 --> 00:04:23.458
writes his project description so that we find answers to the

60
00:04:23.458 --> 00:04:26.955
the questions that the assessment criteria trade

61
00:04:26.955 --> 00:04:27.199
if.

62
00:04:28.630 --> 00:04:33.224
It is also important to use the 2 mandatory

63
00:04:33.224 --> 00:04:38.141
Templates for project description and CV and we do not wish to have

64
00:04:38.141 --> 00:04:41.850
Some other appendices in the application at all.

65
00:04:44.430 --> 00:04:48.424
I have tried to translate the assessment criteria in chapter

66
00:04:48.424 --> 00:04:52.556
7 to small plus and minus list and this is not something

67
00:04:52.556 --> 00:04:56.895
Facts in any way without this is an attempt to simplify

68
00:04:56.895 --> 00:05:01.234
clarify what this, how a good application could see

69
00:05:01.234 --> 00:05:03.369
Out, what kind of properties have.

70
00:05:05.130 --> 00:05:09.741
And as I have been in, it is important to this at

71
00:05:09.741 --> 00:05:14.426
some way and long term it is about the ability of the organization

72
00:05:14.426 --> 00:05:17.940
To be innovative in forward forward simply.

73
00:05:20.770 --> 00:05:23.440
The point of the residence is that you meet.

74
00:05:24.190 --> 00:05:25.420
And different.

75
00:05:26.230 --> 00:05:30.399
Skills that the organization has a type of knowledge and

76
00:05:30.399 --> 00:05:34.569
skill and this person performing the residence has one

77
00:05:34.569 --> 00:05:38.526
Other knowledge so that something new is added.
 So if

78
00:05:38.526 --> 00:05:41.848
that to speak is distance between the person and

79
00:05:41.848 --> 00:05:46.159
The organization's competence will arise as an extra

80
00:05:46.159 --> 00:05:47.290
Interesting meeting.

81
00:05:49.780 --> 00:05:53.821
For us at my mom so it is interesting if our support is playing

82
00:05:53.821 --> 00:05:58.058
big role, that is, this might not have happened without

83
00:05:58.058 --> 00:05:58.710
Our support.

84
00:06:02.160 --> 00:06:06.812
The person who moves on it ends up inside an organization

85
00:06:06.812 --> 00:06:11.694
And it is a way of making transfer of knowledge physically

86
00:06:11.694 --> 00:06:16.347
In the way the human body.
 And there is something even if

87
00:06:16.347 --> 00:06:21.000
We work very digitally today.
 Pretty good also often so

88
00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:25.424
Is there any interesting aspect of knowledge transfer

89
00:06:25.424 --> 00:06:30.305
When you end up on the inside of an organization of an organization

90
00:06:30.305 --> 00:06:32.060
and becomes part of it.

91
00:06:34.630 --> 00:06:38.982
It is interesting in the application to try to understand how

92
00:06:38.982 --> 00:06:43.405
The organization is renewed by welcoming this person

93
00:06:43.405 --> 00:06:44.810
with new skills.

94
00:06:45.940 --> 00:06:51.052
And as I have also been on so or interesting out of portfolio

95
00:06:51.052 --> 00:06:55.205
Perspective If more organizations can open the eyes

96
00:06:55.205 --> 00:06:58.959
For this with individual mobility and residence.

97
00:07:01.040 --> 00:07:05.387
So that the communicative how to spread and how to tell

98
00:07:05.387 --> 00:07:08.130
What you learn is also interesting to.

99
00:07:10.050 --> 00:07:14.400
Get in your project description and so you can do the opposite.

100
00:07:15.200 --> 00:07:19.420
On minus list try to interpret what would be less good
