1
00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:41.560
Welcome!

2
00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:49.440
Here is the first of six programs from the Green Lund theater in Stockholm.

3
00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:56.440
We hope you at home follow the series because it will be a lot of fun.

4
00:00:56.600 --> 00:01:03.440
- Yes, most things will probably be pretty fun.
 -60-70 percent is guaranteed fun.

5
00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:07.440
Half - then we have not promised too much.

6
00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:14.320
If it becomes a weakness in the program, do not change channel - it will be fun later.

7
00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:21.960
When I listen to boring people I usually pretend they get loose beard

8
00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:29.360
With these measurements there is always a risk that validity errors will occur

9
00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:34.560
To ensure internal and external validity -

10
00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:41.520
- So it is important to look back to get a safe hypothesis.

11
00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:45.520
For those of you who want to read more about ...

12
00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:59.600
- What is our ambition of the program?
 - We show it with the flanellographer here.

13
00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:05.200
First and foremost, we want to make a fun program.

14
00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:11.200
And an honest program.
 We do not belong to the ironic generation.

15
00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:16.800
They are now 35 years old and have had children and so ...

16
00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:22.600
But they are still ironic: I "love" my kids.

17
00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:29.480
You can speculate on what happens to Henrik Schyffert at the old age home.

18
00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:34.640
"Have you pooped again, Henrik?"
 - "No."

19
00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:41.400
I never liked the ironic of 90s.
 I never took the irony.

20
00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:49.080
People started giving me compliments and someone said: you ... good looking loafers!

21
00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:56.080
You can divide the Swedish humor into two schools - Eastcoast and Westcoast.

22
00:02:56.240 --> 00:03:02.400
The ironic generation belongs to the Eastcoast School: Andres Lokko -

23
00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:07.880
- Christian Luuk, Henrik Schyffert, Fredrik Lindström and Claes Elfsberg.

24
00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:16.120
The comic is based on a deep fear of being wrong or saying the wrong things.

25
00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:19.520
You have to be "on".

26
00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:26.320
If we leave the cold east coast we see here the warm Westcoast School:

27
00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:30.200
Madness, Kurt Olsson, Stefan Ljungqvist -

28
00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:33.760
- Laila Westersund and Ronny Jönsson.

29
00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:40.160
Their comic is characterized by lack of self -criticism and poor judgment.

30
00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:47.160
The review is weakened and culminates in Halland, the mecca of the Lyteskomiken.

31
00:03:47.320 --> 00:03:54.560
Here, easily figures such as Stefan and Krister, shy Örjan and Augustina arise

32
00:03:54.720 --> 00:04:02.360
There is a clear risk of ridiculous hats and glasses.
 - Over to you!

33
00:04:02.520 --> 00:04:10.520
Thanks.
 - The program should be festive, a little tricky and, above all, fun.

34
00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:15.760
But what is fun?
 We asked 100 Swedes.

35
00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:19.760
-Did we?
 -I did it.

36
00:04:19.920 --> 00:04:23.760
- When did you do it?
 - Now this weekend.

37
00:04:23.920 --> 00:04:30.120
- I went around and asked people.
 - What did they answer, then?

38
00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:35.480
20 percent answered with a counter -question - of the type:

39
00:04:35.640 --> 00:04:39.480
Who are you?
 What are you doing here?

40
00:04:39.640 --> 00:04:43.520
How did you get into my house?

41
00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:47.720
30 % became violent and let the fists speak.

42
00:04:47.880 --> 00:04:54.720
- So the subject arouses strong emotions.
 - You asked nothing else, Johan?

43
00:04:54.880 --> 00:05:01.720
No, not about humor.
 But: May I borrow the toilet?
 Is your daughter sex mature?

44
00:05:02.880 --> 00:05:07.400
We want to make a youthful and fast program -

45
00:05:07.560 --> 00:05:11.960
- At the same time we use the satire as a weapon.

46
00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:17.360
Most importantly: the humor bottoms out in seriousness!

47
00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:22.360
This gives us the name of the program: Rä ... shrimp frozen.

48
00:05:27.120 --> 00:05:34.320
I talked to Mary.
 I'm not wise to her.
 She is so self -sufficient!

49
00:05:34.480 --> 00:05:39.320
I can't handle her.
 She gets worse and worse.

50
00:05:39.480 --> 00:05:46.920
The hard thing is that she thinks she is so good looking.
 I do not think so.

51
00:05:47.080 --> 00:05:53.000
Some probably think she looks good.
 Can you see it?
 Like today:

52
00:05:53.160 --> 00:05:58.000
"Sure I'm fine in my hair?"

53
00:05:58.160 --> 00:06:05.800
It looks too damn good!
 She has put rubber cords on the sides, hip like happ

54
00:06:05.960 --> 00:06:10.400
And then a tassel in the middle of the head!

55
00:06:10.560 --> 00:06:15.680
You can't say she looks like an idiot ...

56
00:06:15.840 --> 00:06:20.160
I said, "Oh, how nice you are! Oh, how nice!"

57
00:06:20.320 --> 00:06:25.000
Actually, one should tell the truth.

58
00:06:25.160 --> 00:06:31.160
She has no taste.
 She mixes colors.

59
00:06:31.320 --> 00:06:36.560
- Now she comes.
 - Can I borrow the binoculars?

60
00:06:36.720 --> 00:06:41.360
- You can ask Dad.
 - It goes great.

61
00:06:41.520 --> 00:06:47.360
- But be careful!
 - Did you see what she was wearing?

62
00:07:07.120 --> 00:07:10.960
My girlfriend is celebrating years tomorrow.

63
00:07:11.120 --> 00:07:15.920
It is difficult to find anything to buy.

64
00:07:16.080 --> 00:07:20.640
- A jewelry is never wrong.
 - Isn't it sad?

65
00:07:20.800 --> 00:07:26.760
It is important that it feels personal to her.
 Clothes?

66
00:07:26.920 --> 00:07:34.880
It's also boring.
 It should be the right size, the right color and shape.

67
00:07:35.040 --> 00:07:40.200
If you buy a gift card, she can choose for herself.

68
00:07:40.360 --> 00:07:47.720
Is it nice to unlock her at a particular deal?
 Cash is better.

69
00:07:47.880 --> 00:07:56.040
Cash is great.
 They have a concrete value.
 It does not have flowers.

70
00:07:56.200 --> 00:08:01.040
Then you say you are worth this.

71
00:08:01.200 --> 00:08:05.040
The question is just how much you give ...

72
00:08:05.200 --> 00:08:09.600
- You may probably give SEK 200.
 -Do you think so?

73
00:08:09.760 --> 00:08:15.040
Yes absolutely.
 200, 150 ... How much does she fill?

74
00:08:15.200 --> 00:08:19.520
- She turns 30. - You may probably give 200.

75
00:08:19.680 --> 00:08:26.920
- It can be wrong.
 She got it last.
 - It will be the same gift two years in a row.

76
00:08:27.080 --> 00:08:34.920
It's not that.
 I had only a five hundred, so she had to withdraw money

77
00:08:35.080 --> 00:08:40.720
It was raining outside.
 The ATM was broken.
 When she came up, I said:

78
00:08:40.880 --> 00:08:48.160
Honey, it's your day.
 Take the whole 500 -tag and you will owe me 300

79
00:08:48.320 --> 00:08:53.800
- So we wrote a small promissory note.
 -It's nice.

80
00:08:53.960 --> 00:09:00.240
I give money to my girlfriend to show that I appreciate her.

81
00:09:00.400 --> 00:09:07.000
If we had a hot night, I put a twenty on the pillow in the morning.

82
00:09:07.160 --> 00:09:10.480
You can girls, Johan.

83
00:09:16.280 --> 00:09:20.640
Hello.
 I would eat for free here today.

84
00:09:20.800 --> 00:09:24.640
-What do you mean?
 - I would not have to pay.

85
00:09:24.800 --> 00:09:28.640
-Who said that?
 - He who owns the restaurant.

86
00:09:28.800 --> 00:09:32.640
It is me, and I have nothing heard.

87
00:09:32.800 --> 00:09:39.240
- I talked to Stefan ... Staffan ... - Bengt?
 He can't decide that.

88
00:09:39.400 --> 00:09:43.640
- No, his name was Bosse, Bertil ... - Albin?

89
00:09:43.800 --> 00:09:50.040
- I talked to Albin today and ... - he is on vacation.

90
00:09:50.200 --> 00:09:56.200
Ah, I just got a chance.
 If so, it goes.
 Very nice restaurant.

91
00:09:59.880 --> 00:10:03.720
We were going to joke a little about rock music.

92
00:10:06.800 --> 00:10:12.640
Hard rock music

93
00:10:21.560 --> 00:10:28.800
David and I have a favorite band - hard rock quartet Kiss.

94
00:10:28.960 --> 00:10:32.960
Here is a foreground figure - Gene Simmons.

95
00:10:33.160 --> 00:10:40.160
Ace Frehley, electric guitar, Paul Stanley and Peter Criss, the drummer.

96
00:10:40.320 --> 00:10:44.960
They are touring even though they are 60 years old.

97
00:10:45.120 --> 00:10:50.320
- How to cope?
 - They have loans and bills ...

98
00:10:50.480 --> 00:10:55.600
And when Genes Fruga whines about the children's ski trip:

99
00:10:55.760 --> 00:11:00.520
"Get the makeup! We'll take another turn."

100
00:11:00.680 --> 00:11:06.800
The makeup, yes!
 It is interesting.
 Gene Simmons is the demon.

101
00:11:06.960 --> 00:11:13.000
This guy is the space man, awesome makeup.
 He here is the star.

102
00:11:13.160 --> 00:11:17.000
But this guy is a cat!

103
00:11:17.160 --> 00:11:25.280
Where was he at the make -up delivery?
 This is how my little acid looks on masks.

104
00:11:25.440 --> 00:11:31.440
How have they reasoned in the rehearsal room?
 "I want to be the cat."

105
00:11:31.600 --> 00:11:36.120
"Or squirrel, maybe, or mård ..."

106
00:11:36.280 --> 00:11:43.520
Peter Criss jumped off the band and was replaced by Eric Carr who became a fox.

107
00:11:43.680 --> 00:11:48.720
The constellation has changed over the years.

108
00:11:48.880 --> 00:11:55.000
A. Frehley was replaced by Vinnie Vincent who had an Egyptian mark in the forehead

109
00:11:55.160 --> 00:12:00.360
It went well for Peter Criss.
 He released three solo discs:

110
00:12:00.520 --> 00:12:05.760
"Out of Control", "Let Me Rock You" and "Cat Number One" -

111
00:12:05.920 --> 00:12:11.840
- With height songs like the classic Blue Moon over Broadway.

112
00:12:13.280 --> 00:12:18.960
It is the original set we love.

113
00:12:19.120 --> 00:12:22.720
As late as 1999 ... - David!

114
00:12:22.880 --> 00:12:24.600
Sorry.

115
00:12:24.760 --> 00:12:30.880
Well, there are no real rock stars left.
 Not in Sweden!

116
00:12:31.040 --> 00:12:38.520
Only one maintains the rock myth with long hair and fireworks: E -type.

117
00:12:38.680 --> 00:12:42.520
We actually have E -type here.

118
00:12:44.080 --> 00:12:48.920
Everyone does not know that Dad to E -type -

119
00:12:49.080 --> 00:12:54.920
- Is none other than the pogram leader in the world of science, Bo G Erikson.

120
00:12:55.080 --> 00:12:58.960
How does it sound on their family dinners?

121
00:12:59.120 --> 00:13:02.840
"Birka was excavated another 3 cm."

122
00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:06.840
E - Type replies: "Coming Up, Coming Up ..."

123
00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:12.240
It is as if Siwert Öholm would be the father of Leila K.

124
00:13:12.400 --> 00:13:18.280
Sweden has had many export - successes: ABBA, Ace of Base, Cardigans

125
00:13:18.440 --> 00:13:26.560
It is sensitive to launch bands.
 In India I saw when Roxette was launched

126
00:13:26.720 --> 00:13:33.040
But Roxette is the brand of India's most popular laxative.

127
00:13:33.200 --> 00:13:38.080
So the record "Crash Boom Bang" did not sell so well.

128
00:13:38.240 --> 00:13:42.040
Many bands do not come that far.
 They are split.

129
00:13:43.800 --> 00:13:46.880
Gigi hamilton-

130
00:13:47.040 --> 00:13:50.560
–Tommy Ekman -

131
00:13:51.720 --> 00:13:54.920
- And Christer Sandelin.

132
00:13:55.080 --> 00:14:01.720
Once they were super trio style.
 Now only bitterness and pain remains

133
00:14:01.880 --> 00:14:08.120
- Of what was once a winning concept.

134
00:14:08.280 --> 00:14:13.560
With songs like "Dover - Calais", "Want You" and "Fantasy" -

135
00:14:13.720 --> 00:14:19.080
- If they have sung straight into the people of Sweden Sweden's heart.

136
00:14:19.240 --> 00:14:23.560
Why was Style split?

137
00:14:23.720 --> 00:14:28.960
In the beginning everything was perfect and just fine.

138
00:14:29.120 --> 00:14:35.600
- Yes, great.
 - It was good with everything then.

139
00:14:35.760 --> 00:14:42.240
- We trusted each other to 100 %.
 - Yes, to 100 %.

140
00:14:42.400 --> 00:14:48.600
When you learn that someone carries a big, dark secret then ... then ...

141
00:14:48.760 --> 00:14:52.440
- You are scared, that is.
 - Yes, very scared.

142
00:14:52.600 --> 00:14:58.280
The background to the brawl is a statement-

143
00:14:58.440 --> 00:15:04.920
- As Gigi Hamilton did at the enriched Music Awards in Gothenburg.

144
00:15:05.080 --> 00:15:12.400
I would like to tell you one thing to Christer and Tommy.
 I'm negro.

145
00:15:12.560 --> 00:15:16.160
Gigi was negro-

146
00:15:16.320 --> 00:15:23.360
- Something she kept secret for Tommy and Christer for many years.

147
00:15:23.520 --> 00:15:27.600
Yes, it came as a shock.

148
00:15:27.760 --> 00:15:34.120
After all, we suspected that everything was not right ... Gigi ate a lot of fruit.

149
00:15:34.280 --> 00:15:40.280
But that she would be negroes we could never imagine.

150
00:15:41.680 --> 00:15:48.360
It was not possible to continue then.
 It feels hard to talk about it.

151
00:15:48.520 --> 00:15:54.040
You have not really realized that it is true.

152
00:15:54.200 --> 00:16:00.240
If Gigi is Negro, you don't know who you can trust anymore.

153
00:16:00.400 --> 00:16:05.800
Then Tommy can be Eskimo or Indian ...

154
00:16:10.280 --> 00:16:16.200
In today's fast community, one must have a person to seek support from.

155
00:16:16.360 --> 00:16:21.600
In the United States, it is popular to hire a so -called.
 Life coach as support.

156
00:16:21.760 --> 00:16:26.320
We have our own lifestyle consultant.
 Hello, Henrik Elmér.

157
00:16:29.640 --> 00:16:35.440
Thanks.
 Welcome to the course "Meet life with Henrik".

158
00:16:35.600 --> 00:16:41.560
We will learn to think positively and to meet life effectively.

159
00:16:41.720 --> 00:16:48.640
Many courses claim that there are no right answers.
 It's nonsense!

160
00:16:48.800 --> 00:16:57.000
On a course in personal development, one should be able to present finished formulas.

161
00:16:57.160 --> 00:17:00.440
Otherwise you are not serious.

162
00:17:00.600 --> 00:17:06.240
A little later you will be able to order this course booklet.

163
00:17:06.400 --> 00:17:13.040
Unfortunately, it has not yet come from the print shop.
 You probably keep up anyway.

164
00:17:13.200 --> 00:17:20.280
Look at the headline, so you see that I have mixed lower and upper case letters.

165
00:17:20.440 --> 00:17:24.840
But it's not random.

166
00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:32.640
The uppercase letters form the word "with", which is the key word in the course.

167
00:17:32.800 --> 00:17:37.880
One should float with your surroundings - do not strive for.

168
00:17:38.040 --> 00:17:42.520
Float with: Acquire!
 Strive against: adversity!

169
00:17:42.680 --> 00:17:45.320
It cannot hurt to sometimes float with

170
00:17:45.480 --> 00:17:49.080
Bring beautiful hand against each spoon

171
00:17:50.200 --> 00:17:54.160
I'll take an everyday example.

172
00:17:54.320 --> 00:18:00.400
I'm single.
 It may feel lonely, but then you should think positively.

173
00:18:00.560 --> 00:18:08.440
I think I'm not single and that someone is waiting for me at home.

174
00:18:08.600 --> 00:18:16.120
When I go home, I call my answering machine: I'm home soon.

175
00:18:16.280 --> 00:18:22.480
I am very happy when someone has called.
 I hear: I'm home soon.

176
00:18:22.640 --> 00:18:29.000
I think: Then I can clean before I get home.

177
00:18:29.160 --> 00:18:37.480
I also thought positively when I was lying and listening to the neighbors who loved

178
00:18:37.640 --> 00:18:44.200
It is actually quite nice to be single, if you compare ...

179
00:18:44.360 --> 00:18:49.960
Before, I was with Gunilla.
 It was hard.

180
00:18:50.120 --> 00:18:56.440
It was embarrassing to hear the neighbors when she lay next to me listening.

181
00:18:56.600 --> 00:19:03.040
It was even more embarrassing when Gunilla's parents slept over in the living room -

182
00:19:03.200 --> 00:19:09.560
- And the neighbors started.
 "Now the parents think we are doing here."

183
00:19:09.720 --> 00:19:13.680
So I screamed, "It's not us!"

184
00:19:13.840 --> 00:19:18.880
Then heard from the living room: "Shut up! That's us."

185
00:19:19.040 --> 00:19:23.040
Next time you can order the booklet.

186
00:19:29.280 --> 00:19:37.040
- Dad, yesterday I saw a horse.
 - Giant fun.
 Did you pat it?

187
00:19:37.200 --> 00:19:44.040
-Yes.
 You know what?
 It eats sugar.
 - Well, that was the worst.

188
00:19:44.200 --> 00:19:50.040
- I want to talk to mom.
 -Wait!
 - Maria is on the phone.

189
00:19:59.320 --> 00:20:06.920
-Hello Maria!
 What fun you call.
 -Yes.
 Yesterday I saw a horse.

190
00:20:07.080 --> 00:20:12.120
- It eats sugar.
 -How exiting.

191
00:20:23.560 --> 00:20:27.120
Stefan, you can start.

192
00:20:27.280 --> 00:20:33.400
We can look at this year's outcome in relation to last spring.

193
00:20:33.560 --> 00:20:41.480
- January was fantastic!
 - You would not have thought.

194
00:20:41.640 --> 00:20:48.480
"Now they can't have money left?"
 But they had, obviously.

195
00:20:48.640 --> 00:20:55.280
- Do we have any overhead images?
 - I have some fresh slides here.

196
00:20:55.440 --> 00:21:02.320
It gets a little more clear when you see the glory in the picture.

197
00:21:02.480 --> 00:21:07.760
I turn on the "respirator" right away.

198
00:21:16.000 --> 00:21:20.840
- This shit doesn't work.
 - Is the contact in?

199
00:21:21.000 --> 00:21:26.360
It is in. There is something wrong with it.
 Shit too!

200
00:21:26.520 --> 00:21:32.080
- Stefan ... - but that's something ... oh!

201
00:21:36.960 --> 00:21:43.680
-Hello.
 - Yes, "the suspects" is a good movie.

202
00:21:44.760 --> 00:21:51.120
I like this movie.
 SEK 45.
 Don't miss the surprise at the end!

203
00:21:53.720 --> 00:21:58.960
The handicapped guy has found everything.

204
00:21:59.120 --> 00:22:03.600
He lies throughout the movie.

205
00:22:03.760 --> 00:22:10.840
Keyser Söze ... is not even there.
 Welcome back!

206
00:22:19.480 --> 00:22:25.200
On February 28, 1986, Sweden changed forever.

207
00:22:25.360 --> 00:22:32.360
Then the greatest leader and the dream of a safe folk home were killed.

208
00:22:32.600 --> 00:22:37.760
Shrimp frozen reviews the murder of Prime Minister Olof Palme.

209
00:22:37.920 --> 00:22:45.880
It is said that all Swedes remember where they were when they were reached by the message.

210
00:22:46.040 --> 00:22:51.960
- Daid, where were you?
 - I was 14 years old then and lived in Lund.

211
00:22:52.120 --> 00:22:58.600
- Do you what you did?
 - I lay in bed in the boy's room and ...

212
00:22:58.760 --> 00:23:01.880
Yes!

213
00:23:02.040 --> 00:23:08.520
They say that everyone remembers exactly what they did.
 Do you?

214
00:23:08.680 --> 00:23:13.680
No.
 Yes, I remember.
 Can we move on?

215
00:23:13.840 --> 00:23:20.160
-What then?
 Did you lay and read?
 - Can you release this now?

216
00:23:20.320 --> 00:23:28.200
I had Affisher with Samantha Fox on the wall.
 You lie there in bed ...

217
00:23:28.360 --> 00:23:32.320
14 years!
 Can we release it?

218
00:23:32.480 --> 00:23:39.640
This event, and the unresolved murder, is like an open wound in the soul of the people.

219
00:23:39.800 --> 00:23:45.160
- Daid!
 - I am an ordinary guy, Johan.
 Okay?

220
00:23:45.320 --> 00:23:49.720
It was in puberty.
 Can we release it?

221
00:23:49.880 --> 00:23:56.240
Hans Holmér immediately started new in the unfortunate PKK track.

222
00:23:56.960 --> 00:23:59.400
David!

223
00:23:59.560 --> 00:24:04.920
That's enough!
 You've had your hands on the blanket all your life ...

224
00:24:05.080 --> 00:24:10.920
You had a loaded rifle in the trolleys and got a women's bike!

225
00:24:11.080 --> 00:24:18.040
The year is thus 1986. The spouses Palme has seen the Mozart brothers at Grand.

226
00:24:18.200 --> 00:24:23.320
They want to walk home and have no bodyguards with them.

227
00:24:23.480 --> 00:24:30.560
At the intersection Sveavägen - Tunnelgatan, the murder takes place.
 The killer disappears.

228
00:24:30.720 --> 00:24:37.920
The next day Sweden wakes up with a jerk.

229
00:24:38.080 --> 00:24:45.080
You fear a coup.
 In a room in Lund, David Batra stains himself!

230
00:24:45.240 --> 00:24:52.120
I thought we would reconstruct the process.
 This is David's room.

231
00:24:52.280 --> 00:25:00.280
The bed and nightstand table.
 Here is Josefsson's underwear catalog -

232
00:25:00.440 --> 00:25:07.040
- From spring and summer –85.
 Here is Samantha Fox on the wall.

233
00:25:07.200 --> 00:25:13.680
Here is David under his quilt.
 Look, how happy he is!

234
00:25:13.840 --> 00:25:22.120
David's mother is not as happy.
 - "Why have you locked the door?"

235
00:25:22.280 --> 00:25:28.320
- "Go, mom! Let me be!"
 - "Stop, you ruin the spinal cord!"

236
00:25:31.840 --> 00:25:39.640
He was so amazing!
 He had been sitting in a minimal inflatable boat -

237
00:25:39.800 --> 00:25:44.040
- Prompt Sigyn.
 Isn't that cool?

238
00:25:44.200 --> 00:25:52.360
Everyone has to get involved. We do not inherit the earth, we borrow it from our children ...

239
00:25:52.520 --> 00:25:56.120
You have to say.

240
00:26:00.840 --> 00:26:07.400
-Thank you and goodbye!
 - It went well?
 -Yes.
 We learned something from the program.

241
00:26:07.560 --> 00:26:14.240
-What have you learned?
 - The palm murder arouses strong emotions.

242
00:26:14.400 --> 00:26:21.760
The most beautiful man can give a woman is still cash.

243
00:26:21.920 --> 00:26:28.880
If you get a slack wine over after dinner, you can freeze it like ice.

244
00:26:29.040 --> 00:26:36.760
When you cook wine sauce, you take out the ice cream and do not have to open a bottle.

245
00:26:36.920 --> 00:26:43.560
- But we didn't say that in the program.
 - CHRISTER said it before the program.

246
00:26:43.720 --> 00:26:48.720
- What do you bring with you from here?
 - This sink.

247
00:26:49.360 --> 00:26:55.240
- It is you who have taken it ... —Mitt has cracked.
 Thanks and good bye!

248
00:28:08.480 --> 00:28:11.880
