1
00:00:00,256 --> 00:00:01,280
My name is Alexander.

2
00:00:01,536 --> 00:00:04,352
I am currently reading year three at LinkÃ¶ping University.

3
00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:06,400
Student life is absolutely fantastic.

4
00:00:08,192 --> 00:00:09,472
Then I would say that the education is absolutely fantastic.

5
00:00:10,496 --> 00:00:16,100
Precisely because our professors and doctoral students want us to burn for it as well,

6
00:00:16,200 --> 00:00:18,176
That way, they feel for the subject.

7
00:00:18,944 --> 00:00:22,528
We get the opportunity to build an artificial intelligence

8
00:00:22,784 --> 00:00:25,088
to Starcraft II.

9
00:00:25,344 --> 00:00:29,440
And it is really cool, because then you are divided into a group,

10
00:00:29,696 --> 00:00:33,024
And there I was responsible for the exploration of the map.

11
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:35,328
How much risk it is that it dies somewhere and

12
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:40,448
So it looks up a good road that it considers to be quite short.

13
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:43,520
For us, this is the way of developing and exploring

14
00:00:44,544 --> 00:00:47,104
The methods available, in a fun way.

15
00:00:47,616 --> 00:00:55,552
After 10,000 rounds, it began to improve.
 It wins 80% of times instead of 40%.

16
00:00:56,576 --> 00:00:59,648
Yes, as a civil engineer you are very flexible.

17
00:00:59,904 --> 00:01:03,232
What we mainly learn is how to pick up information very quickly.

18
00:01:03,488 --> 00:01:09,632
In today's society, many software programmers are needed, because we are moving towards a more digitized society.

19
00:01:10,144 --> 00:01:11,680
There are plenty of jobs afterwards.

20
00:01:11,936 --> 00:01:17,296
And if you do not want to work within Sweden, there are opportunities to get abroad as well.

21
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:19,872
Today so that I chose software technology,

22
00:01:20,384 --> 00:01:25,504
Because that is really the education I want to read, given the content and focus area.

23
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:28,576
Once you are in the middle of it, then almost wish it was longer.

24
00:01:28,832 --> 00:01:33,184
For the years go so fast.
