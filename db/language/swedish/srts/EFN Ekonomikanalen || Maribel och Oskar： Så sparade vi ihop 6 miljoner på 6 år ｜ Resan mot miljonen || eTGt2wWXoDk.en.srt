1
00:00:00,880 --> 00:00:05,560
How does it feel not to have to work?
 Maribel Leander Lindberg-

2
00:00:05,640 --> 00:00:11,120
-and Oskar Lindberg, who decided to take control of his time and money-

3
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:13,200
-and become financially free.

4
00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:20,400
-Welcome here, Oskar and Maribel.
 -Thanks.

5
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:26,440
You have been financially free for six years, but we back the band a bit.

6
00:00:26,520 --> 00:00:32,000
What did your life look like before you started saving against it?

7
00:00:33,800 --> 00:00:38,600
We usually have 2011 as a small starting shot.
 But before it-

8
00:00:38,680 --> 00:00:43,280
-So it was probably the lives of many.
 We then had two small children.

9
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:49,840
We both had full -time positions at large Swedish companies.

10
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:52,760
We worked pretty much.

11
00:00:52,840 --> 00:00:57,880
No more than others maybe, but it was 8-17 every day of the week.

12
00:00:57,960 --> 00:01:03,960
And six weeks of vacation on it.
 So there was a lot about the logistics-

13
00:01:04,040 --> 00:01:09,000
-To have an everyday life with our children and full -time jobs.

14
00:01:09,080 --> 00:01:14,920
It was the feeling of having the breath in the throat and to catch with-

15
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:19,040
-To get them food before going on something else.

16
00:01:19,120 --> 00:01:23,080
I traveled a great deal in the job, so sometimes Maribel-

17
00:01:23,160 --> 00:01:27,400
-At home and managed everything yourself.
 So there was no time left.

18
00:01:27,480 --> 00:01:33,200
In 2011 we were on a longer trip together, the whole family.

19
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:38,400
We were gone for eight months and in the meantime we started to get perspectives on things.

20
00:01:38,480 --> 00:01:43,680
When you live outside your everyday life, these thoughts come.

21
00:01:43,760 --> 00:01:49,240
We were in Mexico, where I have family and suddenly had more time for each other-

22
00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:54,120
-More time for our children, and more time for friends and relatives.

23
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:57,360
We felt we wanted to get that feeling at home.

24
00:01:57,440 --> 00:02:03,720
At home, it felt like a transport route for the weekend or for the holiday.

25
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:10,120
They worked to get these breaks.
 We wanted to bring that feeling we had.

26
00:02:10,200 --> 00:02:13,800
We didn't have the words for it then.

27
00:02:13,880 --> 00:02:18,760
But now we call it an everyday life that we do not need to take vacation from.

28
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:23,680
We want the change where vacation is something different to everyday-

29
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:30,000
-But it should not be a quality difference.
 Everyday life should be good, desirable.

30
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:37,160
Then we will take a closer look at some special events-

31
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:41,880
-As has meant a lot to Maribel's and Oskar's savings.

32
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:48,440
We have with us a person who has inspired you a lot: Mr.
 Money Mustache.

33
00:02:48,520 --> 00:02:51,560
Who is it and what does he mean to you?

34
00:02:51,640 --> 00:02:57,000
It is an American blogger who started in 2011, while we started saving.

35
00:02:57,080 --> 00:03:00,560
He and his family and wife-

36
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:04,120
-Haded in early retirement, as he called it.

37
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:09,200
They were in their 30s, after working for eight years.

38
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:13,680
They felt like an ordinary family.

39
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:18,360
Admittedly, it was in the United States, but we could interpret it to our conditions.

40
00:03:18,440 --> 00:03:24,320
It felt like Goldable.
 Then it coincided with our experience in Mexico by a life-

41
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:29,760
-As we looked like we wanted life to look.
 So it fit perfectly together.

42
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:34,400
I think it says: "Financial Freedom Through Badassity."

43
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:39,600
There was a lot of focus on thrift.
 Cycle everywhere.

44
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:43,560
Do a lot of yourself.
 We were attracted a lot of that.

45
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:46,440
Don't be so small.

46
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:52,440
There is a quote that inspired you some.

47
00:03:53,720 --> 00:03:58,800
-Here we have it.
 -"Common Sense is not very common."

48
00:03:58,880 --> 00:04:03,960
It may not have inspired us so much, but that is something we have discovered.

49
00:04:04,040 --> 00:04:11,720
It should be common sense not to waste money, nature's resources or their time.

50
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:18,680
Sometimes when we talk about what we have done, it feels like we just stumble up common sense.

51
00:04:18,760 --> 00:04:23,880
But then you look around or listen, and notice that so few live after this.

52
00:04:23,960 --> 00:04:30,280
Then there is a need for the message, because we may have forgotten somewhere ...

53
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:36,160
Older people, 70 plus or 80, have come to us and said:

54
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:41,840
"But we've always lived like that."
 Then you wonder where it has gone.

55
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:46,680
Has it been lost?
 Like this with walking and cycling.

56
00:04:46,760 --> 00:04:53,240
Does it make sense if I will only be five kilometers, then to bring a two ton heavy steel monster?

57
00:04:53,320 --> 00:04:57,560
Is it enough with my legs or a bike?

58
00:04:57,640 --> 00:05:01,760
But it is so natural for us to be so ineffective.

59
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:09,920
Here I also have you - where you pull in the same direction.

60
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:15,920
Why has it been important to you during the savings journey?

61
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:20,920
Yes, it is almost a necessity.

62
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:26,520
To talk together, to have common goals that you pull against together.

63
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:32,320
You know what happens if you sit in a canoe and paddle in different directions.

64
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:37,040
When we have common goals, we have been able to pepper each other.

65
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:42,880
When someone is not really motivated, you do not have a bad day at the same time.

66
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:47,000
Then we have been able to pepper each other because we are heading in the same direction.

67
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:55,480
It applies to both economic and all our lives that we try to choose the direction in the same direction.

68
00:05:55,560 --> 00:06:01,720
And tune in this direction.
 It can change.

69
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:05,600
Do you have any tips for others who save in pairs?

70
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:09,840
A kickoff.
 Preferably once a year.

71
00:06:09,920 --> 00:06:14,960
Maybe two, to follow up a bit.
 It is obvious in many companies.

72
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:19,320
But you may not do it in your own privacy.
 Which for us has become obvious.

73
00:06:20,440 --> 00:06:25,680
So we have this lovely picture.

74
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:28,760
What is the smiling family we see here?

75
00:06:28,840 --> 00:06:31,960
This is 2011 in Mexico.

76
00:06:32,040 --> 00:06:37,400
We sit with our children on the stairs outside the apartment we rented.

77
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:44,360
In that apartment we had much less space than at home, because we had too big a house.

78
00:06:44,440 --> 00:06:49,040
It was a big apartment, but it was half as big as the house at home.

79
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:53,920
-We had a simple equipment.
 -We went there with our suitcases with clothes.

80
00:06:54,000 --> 00:07:01,160
We didn't have a lot of commitments, but it was very simple.

81
00:07:01,240 --> 00:07:04,760
It was a wonderful start.
 We got a taste of it.

82
00:07:04,840 --> 00:07:10,400
Although we were not to move to Mexico, it was that composition of life-

83
00:07:10,480 --> 00:07:13,280
-As we have had our eyes.

84
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:18,040
We all had parts there that we wanted to bring home.

85
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:21,600
What changes did you do?
 Where did you start?

86
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:25,840
To save a sum of money that we can then live on for the rest of our lives.

87
00:07:25,920 --> 00:07:29,840
When we arrived at it, we began to look at-

88
00:07:29,920 --> 00:07:36,560
-What expenses that do not add to our quality of life.

89
00:07:36,640 --> 00:07:39,640
In the short term, it was the simple things.

90
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:43,840
Actually what is always in the newspaper on January 24:

91
00:07:43,920 --> 00:07:48,840
"Bring your lunch box, cycle instead of taking the car" ...

92
00:07:48,920 --> 00:07:54,760
"Pull in everything everyday, don't buy more clothes if it's already full in the closet."

93
00:07:54,840 --> 00:07:58,360
It was the first things.

94
00:07:58,440 --> 00:08:03,440
We started to cooperate, started living more locally and seeing what we had around us.

95
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:06,560
In the next step it was to design for life.

96
00:08:06,640 --> 00:08:12,960
Oskar likes to count, so he started counting on it.
 We saw a pension around 55.

97
00:08:13,040 --> 00:08:15,800
But it went a little faster.

98
00:08:15,880 --> 00:08:20,920
When you started counting on it, what was the sum you got?

99
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:27,160
We started from the four percent rule.
 I want to call it a rule of thumb.

100
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:32,760
If you think it is an absolute truth, it can be a little dangerous.

101
00:08:32,840 --> 00:08:37,600
It is about that if one can expect to safely get 4 % return-

102
00:08:37,680 --> 00:08:43,040
-To you can live on that return, and theoretically, capital should suffice for eternal

103
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:48,200
-or at least for a very long time.
 As long as one can be expected to live.

104
00:08:48,280 --> 00:08:54,920
If you look at how we use it, then it is a feature of-

105
00:08:55,000 --> 00:09:00,520
-How much you need to live and how much capital you have.

106
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:07,040
One of the reasons why this time became shorter was that we became more capable on-

107
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:12,800
-To put away money, but also live better on a smaller sum than we could dream of.

108
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:17,960
When we realized it, it became a smaller sum we needed to save.

109
00:09:18,040 --> 00:09:22,880
This time shrunk.

110
00:09:22,960 --> 00:09:26,880
Didn't you feel that you sacrificed anything or missed anything?

111
00:09:26,960 --> 00:09:29,480
The cheeses maybe.

112
00:09:31,560 --> 00:09:34,560
I am very fond of good cheeses.

113
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:40,040
But it was also like an experiment to see what you can do.
 What do we want a lot?

114
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:42,640
What do we want in our lives?

115
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:49,280
To buy really nice cheeses from France and Spain for many hundreds of kronor-

116
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:54,080
-Ir not directly life's emergency.
 You can be without it for a while.

117
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:58,040
For you then, Maribel.
 Is there anything missing?

118
00:09:58,120 --> 00:10:05,520
No ... Many people ask, "Have you chosen a lot of things?"

119
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:10,640
When we started it was very clear that we started planning our life-

120
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:14,480
-And our economy, but above all we made a life plan.

121
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:20,200
We usually sit down twice a year and look at what we want with this year-

122
00:10:20,280 --> 00:10:24,080
-Card.
 What do we want five and ten years ahead?

123
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:29,200
Then it becomes clear where we want to spend our money and what we want to choose.

124
00:10:29,280 --> 00:10:36,400
As we make the reconciliations it becomes mentally easier-

125
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:40,800
-The thing I save money for what I want this year or next year.

126
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:46,080
I don't feel like I miss anything.

127
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:52,040
We have had much more focus on what we have chosen than what we have chosen.

128
00:10:52,120 --> 00:10:56,280
What sum did you consider to be enough to live on?

129
00:10:56,360 --> 00:10:59,040
Six million.

130
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:03,040
And how big is your monthly cost?

131
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:08,200
Then it was 20,000. Now it is rather between 25,000 and 30,000.

132
00:11:08,280 --> 00:11:12,160
The children have become older, inflation-

133
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:17,600
-And then we have received a leisure activity that draws some money-

134
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:23,080
-An if we try to be smart ... we go a lot of skiing in the winter.

135
00:11:23,160 --> 00:11:25,400
How did investment go in the beginning?

136
00:11:25,480 --> 00:11:31,320
We made a plan at the beginning of the year.
 Around this much we can probably put away per month.

137
00:11:31,400 --> 00:11:38,680
Then we bought shares for that amount every month, so it became an equally large buy-

138
00:11:38,760 --> 00:11:42,920
-In the end of each month.
 Wages and expenses went up and down-

139
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:46,600
-And it got a little over we saved it on a bank account

140
00:11:46,680 --> 00:11:51,320
-So that for a period, for example, we could buy for 25,000 per month.

141
00:11:51,400 --> 00:11:56,440
If the stock market went up it was fun and went down we got a little more for the money.

142
00:11:56,520 --> 00:11:59,840
It didn't feel like we went in with a huge amount-

143
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:03,440
-So that it gets too hard to hold on if it goes down.

144
00:12:03,520 --> 00:12:08,640
Have you been worried sometime during the savings trip?

145
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:15,160
No, rather the opposite.
 The more we have saved, the safer we have felt.

146
00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:22,000
The little rucksack with money is growing.
 Like a backpack that becomes more full.

147
00:12:22,080 --> 00:12:25,040
For us, it gave much more security.

148
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:30,520
In 2008 it was also a bit crisis, some companies pulled down-

149
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:36,120
-But we felt: happens something we have something to take from.

150
00:12:36,200 --> 00:12:39,760
So we didn't feel worried.

151
00:12:39,840 --> 00:12:46,880
No, and we see that our greatest strength-

152
00:12:46,960 --> 00:12:50,080
-Is that we can live well on a small sum.

153
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:56,640
It means ... We work every now and then when we feel it-

154
00:12:56,720 --> 00:13:03,400
-And when there are fun things to do.
 Do we need to supplement with income-

155
00:13:03,480 --> 00:13:07,640
-Is not so large sums, we can live well on a little money.

156
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:11,360
It's almost the biggest.
 The backpack with money is good-

157
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:15,280
-It probably thought Pippi too ...

158
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:20,360
But the setting is more important.
 And the ability to live well on a little.

159
00:13:20,440 --> 00:13:23,640
-It's the great strength.
 -A very great strength.

160
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:25,600
Security.

161
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:31,200
Somewhere there you must have seen that it started to tick on pretty well.

162
00:13:31,280 --> 00:13:34,280
What did it mean to see the money grow?

163
00:13:34,360 --> 00:13:41,520
If we are to relate to something where we started counting down it was more

164
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:46,760
-"When can we quit work".
 It was rather that than the sum of money.

165
00:13:46,840 --> 00:13:52,320
That was always what was the goal for us.
 We wanted to own our time-

166
00:13:52,400 --> 00:13:57,400
-and when we saw that we began to approach that point, it was probably bigger-

167
00:13:57,480 --> 00:14:01,040
-An the very sum of money in the account.

168
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:07,280
Do you have any tips for those who are aiming for being financially free?

169
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:10,400
Start today.

170
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:15,920
It's boring, but find out where the money goes.

171
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:19,880
Many people probably feel that the money is not enough-

172
00:14:19,960 --> 00:14:23,120
-Ca even more today with the high inflation ...

173
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:27,120
But you have gone through and seen where the money takes the road ...

174
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:30,080
Are these really things I value?

175
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:33,920
If you do, you can see ...

176
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:39,040
I put a lot on this, but do I appreciate it so much?

177
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:42,000
Most people are probably very surprised.

178
00:14:42,080 --> 00:14:46,560
Once you have pulled down the expens-

179
00:14:46,640 --> 00:14:53,120
-So that those with margin is less than the income and one-

180
00:14:53,200 --> 00:14:57,640
-Avy a good life, you have already become much more financially free.

181
00:14:57,720 --> 00:15:00,880
So that's not a point where you have to go to the finish.

182
00:15:00,960 --> 00:15:04,240
Already there is suddenly ...

183
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:07,360
I can do something happen.

184
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:12,560
I can change jobs if I get craving it.
 Completely different opportunities open.

185
00:15:12,640 --> 00:15:17,440
But then also to think out what is the goal of financial freedom.

186
00:15:17,520 --> 00:15:21,480
What do I want?
 To get down to the core.

187
00:15:21,560 --> 00:15:27,240
-You have to put the idea.
 -It must be motivating ...

188
00:15:27,320 --> 00:15:33,960
If you want to make the whole trip, it does not happen overnight.

189
00:15:34,040 --> 00:15:39,720
For us it went faster than we ever ... but you have to endure for six years.

190
00:15:39,800 --> 00:15:45,320
And with some lifestyle changes, you don't even hold out for a month.

191
00:15:45,400 --> 00:15:49,920

194
