1
00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:55.760
How many?
 Five?
 Mardell we have to keep an eye on.

2
00:00:55.920 --> 00:01:02.520
Last time he bluffed my money.
 What then "better card"?!

3
00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:06.880
Lena is at "conference".

4
00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:11.800
Baths a whirlpool and laughs at the small savers ...

5
00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:19.920
Okay, then we'll see you.
 - Well, kids ... do you manage alone for a few hours?

6
00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:27.720
- We have done this since we were born ... - I have loaded the pantry with food.

7
00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:32.320
Two bananas and one package of Mariekex!

8
00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:36.840
Alone in the house - what an adventure!

9
00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:42.840
It is almost blackened!
 - What should we do?

10
00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:49.120
- Hopping in beds or going handrail ... - Now I'm on my way.

11
00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:55.120
Gustav, are you sure you should not come along?

12
00:01:55.280 --> 00:02:01.120
Someone must make sure it works here at home.

13
00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:09.080
And play poker ... those people you have met every week for ten years!

14
00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:17.240
- Because I like them!
 - You never dare to try anything new.

15
00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:25.640
I do!
 This morning I tried that new toothpaste you bought.

16
00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:29.440
It wasn't good!

17
00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:33.240
It was foot ointment.

18
00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:41.760
Don't worry about the kids.
 I have arranged a babysitter.

19
00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:49.360
- Mom, we're actually big now!
 -Yes!
 Surely it is an unnecessary expense?

20
00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:56.760
- This babysitter works for free ... - tadaaa!
 What do you say now?

21
00:02:56.920 --> 00:03:04.040
- Close the door.
 It pulls.
 - Yeah, what I have longed for you!

22
00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:12.200
- Is it you who is our babysitter?
 - Lena told me you were alone.

23
00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:20.200
Pontus would also go away, so it was a perfect opportunity to meet you!

24
00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:25.800
You didn't check if we had other plans?

25
00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:31.560
Be a little kind.
 It's been four months since last.

26
00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:38.760
- Three and a half, but okay.
 - Sara, we get to talk more later.

27
00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:43.040
- Did you think the phone number?
 -No!

28
00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:46.680
How nice!
 Kiss!

29
00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:53.240
Think, a whole weekend with you!

30
00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:58.200
Tell!
 It must have happened a lot!

31
00:03:58.360 --> 00:04:04.040
- Yes, Dad has bought a new toaster.
 - Yeah!
 A brown.

32
00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:15.120
There came visits from Stockholm that I have to spend time with.

33
00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:21.640
Yes, it's a fucking city, but now it is!

34
00:04:21.800 --> 00:04:25.240
Where are the kids?

35
00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:32.360
I do not know.
 Do they know where I am so they stay away ...

36
00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:37.160
The food is ready!
 Where do you usually sit?

37
00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:41.160
-I'm sitting here.
 -Here.

38
00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:47.000
Obvious!
 Father and daughter, mother and son ...

39
00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:52.800
- You know that you are not our mom, huh?
 -Obvious!

40
00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:56.600
So ... be so good ...

41
00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:04.560
-What's that?
 - Sushi.

42
00:05:04.720 --> 00:05:08.200
Pontus and I eat it evenly.

43
00:05:08.360 --> 00:05:14.000
You can eat with your fingers.
 Start, Gustav.

44
00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:17.920
-No thanks.
 - Gustav ...

45
00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:23.520
You can play with the boys some other time.

46
00:05:23.680 --> 00:05:29.040
How are things in Stockholm?
 What do you usually do?

47
00:05:29.200 --> 00:05:35.880
On weekends we go out and eat, go in some fun place ...

48
00:05:36.040 --> 00:05:43.480
- It has opened a new nightclub!
 -Thanks!
 There are children in the room!

49
00:05:43.640 --> 00:05:50.920
Yes, yes ... Stockholm is wonderful!
 I'm glad I moved there.

50
00:05:51.080 --> 00:05:54.960
What about Pontus, do you enjoy together?

51
00:05:55.120 --> 00:05:58.440
I have something important to tell ...

52
00:05:58.600 --> 00:06:05.560
-Oh no!
 He has left you!
 - You have left him and want to live here?

53
00:06:05.720 --> 00:06:12.960
- He is sick and is to be operated?
 - Pontus and I will have children.

54
00:06:13.120 --> 00:06:17.560
- I want a family.
 -Why?

55
00:06:19.080 --> 00:06:24.520
- Getting a family is the meaning of life!
 -Thanks!

56
00:06:24.680 --> 00:06:32.320
That's why I wanted to be with you and feel the advantages and disadvantages.

57
00:06:32.480 --> 00:06:36.120
The disadvantage is there.

58
00:06:36.280 --> 00:06:42.120
-I understand.
 We are guinea pigs.
 - Don't see it so.

59
00:06:42.280 --> 00:06:48.440
It's like buying a car.
 You want to test drive first.

60
00:06:48.600 --> 00:06:56.040
Welcome!
 You are about to test drive the families' Rolls Royce!

61
00:06:56.880 --> 00:07:00.520
Rather flat mop ...

62
00:07:00.680 --> 00:07:04.520
You have to get your gifts!

63
00:07:08.280 --> 00:07:12.720
Exciting things that are not here ...

64
00:07:12.880 --> 00:07:17.320
Yes, some in school grow themselves.

65
00:07:17.480 --> 00:07:22.400
- This is actually nice.
 You are welcome.
 -Thanks.

66
00:07:22.560 --> 00:07:29.200
- Did you think about sushi?
 - Think that raw fish can taste so good!

67
00:07:31.800 --> 00:07:37.960
-What is this?
 - The city house in winter garb.
 Turn it.

68
00:07:38.120 --> 00:07:43.040
Look!
 It's snowing!
 What invention, huh?

69
00:07:45.360 --> 00:07:51.200
Now you understand how far before they are in Stockholm.

70
00:07:51.360 --> 00:07:58.240
- This is to you, Lina.
 - A t - shirt with the Globe on, maybe?

71
00:07:58.400 --> 00:08:02.280
It actually is a little more fun.

72
00:08:02.440 --> 00:08:08.280
- The nest tower ... - did you prefer to have the Globe?

73
00:08:08.440 --> 00:08:14.440
No.
 I become the most popular girl of the school ...

74
00:08:14.600 --> 00:08:19.920
- To you ... - I don't get away.

75
00:08:21.920 --> 00:08:25.560
Yes, yes ... underwear.

76
00:08:25.720 --> 00:08:29.360
Björn Borg - Calunders.

77
00:08:34.640 --> 00:08:39.760
"To my friend Gustav from ... Björn Borg."

78
00:08:47.280 --> 00:08:50.720
What do you say now?

79
00:08:50.880 --> 00:08:55.320
It's the finest gift I received!

80
00:08:55.480 --> 00:09:02.800
- He stood and signed at NK ... - you may only have them when you turn years.

81
00:09:02.960 --> 00:09:09.600
Children, listen carefully.
 These should never be worn by any human being.

82
00:09:09.760 --> 00:09:15.400
- They are over.
 They are "Karim".
 -What did you say?

83
00:09:15.560 --> 00:09:21.240
It is Hebrew: elevated, forever inadvertent.

84
00:09:21.400 --> 00:09:27.240
Only the Virgin Mary and these are.

85
00:09:36.360 --> 00:09:44.240
- Do you mark any difference in here?
 -Yes.
 Your wedding photo is gone.

86
00:09:44.400 --> 00:09:50.880
- Do you do she get angry?
 - No, there are underwear there.

87
00:09:51.040 --> 00:09:57.360
-It is one o'clock.
 What should we do?
 - I am going to Camilla.

88
00:09:57.520 --> 00:10:04.960
I am here for such a short time.
 Can't we do anything together, like a real family?

89
00:10:05.120 --> 00:10:10.480
Tell!
 What do you do in a real family?

90
00:10:10.640 --> 00:10:17.160
You make excursions, you play games, big shops ...

91
00:10:17.320 --> 00:10:24.960
- We go to the new shopping center!
 - Yes, there we have never been!

92
00:10:25.120 --> 00:10:30.000
Stop!
 I've said that before:

93
00:10:30.160 --> 00:10:37.600
We do not fall for simple cream tricks!
 We have a well -sorted consumption here!

94
00:10:37.760 --> 00:10:44.960
- Sorted?
 They lack middle milk!
 - Tyd, max.
 No one is perfect.

95
00:10:45.120 --> 00:10:52.560
-What then?
 Do they not have middle milk?
 - They said they had heard of it.

96
00:10:52.720 --> 00:10:57.360
They have four floors.
 Over 50 stores!

97
00:10:57.520 --> 00:11:04.840
- And may they all burn in hell.
 --Inomhus fountain and water slide!

98
00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:09.440
They can have dancing penguins too!

99
00:11:09.600 --> 00:11:15.240
They have that!
 At one o'clock outside McDonald's.

100
00:11:15.400 --> 00:11:21.080
I don't dance after the pipe of commercialism!

101
00:11:21.240 --> 00:11:27.240
But look ... it is three o'clock it is the Banarne show.

102
00:11:27.400 --> 00:11:34.480
- He will introduce some new coffee.
 - The tracks?
 The real one, from TV?

103
00:11:34.640 --> 00:11:36.920
Yes.

104
00:11:38.080 --> 00:11:46.160
They had everything!
 I was actually a little set when you showed up this morning.

105
00:11:55.120 --> 00:12:00.960
But I have to say that this struck most.

106
00:12:01.120 --> 00:12:08.120
–Fast I pulled you away from the show?
 - I had seen it three times.

107
00:12:08.280 --> 00:12:13.920
Funny middle talk, good songs ... you were shrugged!

108
00:12:14.080 --> 00:12:19.680
The banaries looked surprised when you hugged him.

109
00:12:19.840 --> 00:12:25.200
I was moved.
 He was probably too.

110
00:12:25.360 --> 00:12:29.800
Look, how nice he wrote to me.

111
00:12:35.880 --> 00:12:43.240
Then was it good that you came along?
 "Copenhagen" wasn't so stupid, huh?

112
00:12:43.400 --> 00:12:50.760
The "free city" should be hot!
 See!
 You had to take as many people you wanted.

113
00:12:51.920 --> 00:12:54.960
Buttons?

114
00:12:55.120 --> 00:13:02.040
Nonstop!
 That stupid clown had a whole wheelbarrow full!

115
00:13:02.200 --> 00:13:08.680
- They were for the children.
 - kids now just have and ha!

116
00:13:13.720 --> 00:13:21.160
- It's been a long time since I had so much fun.
 - I knew you could change.

117
00:13:21.320 --> 00:13:28.760
Now we help fix the dinner!
 I start by peeling potatoes.

118
00:13:32.920 --> 00:13:36.280
Start!

119
00:13:39.160 --> 00:13:44.040
One, two, three ... I passed go!
 Phone signal

120
00:13:44.200 --> 00:13:47.480
Take it you, max.

121
00:13:48.640 --> 00:13:55.360
Max Svensson.
 I do not know.
 - Pettersson wonders when you come.

122
00:13:55.520 --> 00:14:03.160
- They should start playing the second round.
 - I don't have time with his poker!

123
00:14:03.320 --> 00:14:09.760
You heard, huh?
 I know.
 He is cheating in monopoly as well.
 Bye.

124
00:14:12.600 --> 00:14:19.160
Well ... what do you say?
 Could there be any mom of me?

125
00:14:19.320 --> 00:14:22.320
Absolutely!

126
00:14:22.480 --> 00:14:28.120
- Your family becomes a happy family!
 -Do you mean it?

127
00:14:28.280 --> 00:14:32.160
You are safe, have fantasy ...

128
00:14:32.320 --> 00:14:36.160
... and standing on Hamngatan!

129
00:14:36.320 --> 00:14:41.560
Where did your talk about solidarity go?

130
00:14:41.720 --> 00:14:48.200
I have almost a million.
 Then you do not need solidarity.

131
00:14:48.360 --> 00:14:54.840
The family plays games and little pans and has a cozy ...

132
00:14:55.000 --> 00:15:01.480
Yes, we should play monopoly more often.
 Here the intelligence determines.

133
00:15:01.640 --> 00:15:05.280
Exactly.
 Stupidest wins.

134
00:15:06.120 --> 00:15:09.960
I have to ask one thing ...

135
00:15:11.120 --> 00:15:18.280
You have been together as a family for almost fifteen years.
 How do you cope?

136
00:15:18.440 --> 00:15:22.880
What makes it work?

137
00:15:23.040 --> 00:15:29.400
- We eat at different times.
 - Sara is on something essential.

138
00:15:29.560 --> 00:15:36.200
What do you think is the reason why we enjoy it so well?

139
00:15:42.960 --> 00:15:50.600
I can say what I think.
 It is enough that you let each other be different.

140
00:15:50.760 --> 00:15:55.600
The Svensson family's three words of honor are:

141
00:15:55.760 --> 00:16:01.440
Respect, community and enormous warmth.

142
00:16:02.880 --> 00:16:07.360
You have mixed us up with others ...

143
00:16:08.400 --> 00:16:12.240
I think the most important thing is -

144
00:16:12.400 --> 00:16:17.640
- That we care about each other, listen ...

145
00:16:17.800 --> 00:16:21.400
Silent, Lina ...

146
00:16:21.560 --> 00:16:29.200
In the family you can try your thoughts and ideas without being convicted.

147
00:16:29.360 --> 00:16:34.760
Like when you rebuilt the lawnmower into a kitchen fan?

148
00:16:34.920 --> 00:16:42.880
Then you lined up!
 Didn't say a word when mom wondered over grass in the ceiling.

149
00:16:43.040 --> 00:16:50.400
- Because you safeguarded the family!
 - And because you gave us half the salary.

150
00:16:50.560 --> 00:16:54.000
What is most important?

151
00:16:54.160 --> 00:17:00.520
Whatever I do, I know that mom and dad love me!

152
00:17:00.680 --> 00:17:06.800
- What has tuned it?
 -No.
 But that's what she wants to hear.

153
00:17:07.760 --> 00:17:14.600
But God ... it is almost eight o'clock.
 Replace.
 The disco will start soon.

154
00:17:14.760 --> 00:17:21.200
- Disk?
 Which disco?
 - At the People's House.
 It's live -band.

155
00:17:21.360 --> 00:17:26.720
Wait now ... What's wrong with the Knatte disco?

156
00:17:26.880 --> 00:17:33.600
- Just that the guys are enough here ... - I want to see the horror movie tonight.

157
00:17:33.760 --> 00:17:38.720
- Yeah ... are you satisfied now?
 –Wa?

158
00:17:40.080 --> 00:17:46.720
All the community we just talked about you have just ruined!

159
00:17:46.880 --> 00:17:54.240
Come on now!
 Lina is fifteen years old.
 She must be able to go to the People's House!

160
00:17:54.400 --> 00:18:00.240
What did you do at that age when you would have fun?

161
00:18:00.400 --> 00:18:05.440
- On the plot, you mean?
 -It was nothing...

162
00:18:05.600 --> 00:18:11.560
-I'm getting ready.
 - Gustav ... Take it easy.

163
00:18:11.720 --> 00:18:18.360
She can borrow my mobile phone.
 Sure, yes ... money for taxi.

164
00:18:18.520 --> 00:18:25.880
- Okay, then I'll see the movie!
 - Just don't talk about anything for mom.

165
00:18:26.040 --> 00:18:31.680
-What is it called?
 - Devil's offspring, part 5.

166
00:18:34.840 --> 00:18:40.280
- Was the movie scary?
 - Sick, not very much.

167
00:18:40.440 --> 00:18:48.160
- What are you doing in this bed?
 - You probably don't want to lie here alone?

168
00:18:49.320 --> 00:18:57.480
- Of such movies you just get scared!
 - I am not afraid but panic.

169
00:18:57.640 --> 00:19:05.720
Max, everything is on pretend.
 The blood is ketchup and the monsters men with masks.

170
00:19:05.880 --> 00:19:09.040
-Okay?
 -Okay.

171
00:19:16.400 --> 00:19:19.400
What is it now?

172
00:19:19.560 --> 00:19:23.520
The devil has 6's tattooed in the hood.

173
00:19:23.680 --> 00:19:31.800
Lie down and be quiet!
 Or go into your room and read Kalle Duck.

174
00:19:34.480 --> 00:19:39.920
Is it Lina?
 Huh?
 Ask them to lower the music!

175
00:19:40.080 --> 00:19:46.320
What are you doing?
 Dancing?
 It's time for you to dance home!

176
00:19:46.480 --> 00:19:52.720
It's getting late!
 Take a taxi now.
 Niklas Urban - now!

177
00:19:53.680 --> 00:19:56.760
Bye.

178
00:19:56.920 --> 00:20:03.760
What to do for the line?
 After all, she is fifteen years ...

179
00:20:03.920 --> 00:20:11.680
Yes, it is a difficult age, with the adult woman's need for confirmation -

180
00:20:11.840 --> 00:20:16.280
- And the child's longing for security.

181
00:20:20.520 --> 00:20:26.360
-Go to sleep.
 -Okay.
 Wake me up to Disney Day.

182
00:20:26.520 --> 00:20:33.880
Good night.
 Check in your wardrobe.
 I thought I heard something hissing ...

183
00:20:40.080 --> 00:20:44.520
- Gustav ... are you sleeping?
 - No, I read.

184
00:20:44.680 --> 00:20:50.440
- I've been lying.
 - No danger, I always do.

185
00:20:50.600 --> 00:20:55.880
- Pontus does not want to form a family at all.
 –Wa?

186
00:20:56.040 --> 00:21:02.960
I asked if he wanted children with me.
 He said, "We'll see."

187
00:21:03.120 --> 00:21:09.080
It certainly sounds like the devil himself ...

188
00:21:09.240 --> 00:21:16.160
- You know that "we'll see" means no.
 - You should hear a secret.

189
00:21:16.320 --> 00:21:23.200
The worst men know is sudden demands - our instinct is to infect.

190
00:21:23.360 --> 00:21:30.720
We want reflection time.
 It is about not having to choose in the long run.

191
00:21:32.320 --> 00:21:38.160
-How do you mean?
 - If you reveal one, you miss something else.

192
00:21:38.320 --> 00:21:45.400
If I stand and veil at a glass kiosk and choose a big stroke -

193
00:21:45.560 --> 00:21:50.000
- Then I will be missing out on a good Nogger.

194
00:21:54.120 --> 00:21:58.560
I would probably have taken an igloo.

195
00:22:02.560 --> 00:22:07.800
Sara ... Give him time to vela -

196
00:22:07.960 --> 00:22:13.800
- So it works out.
 Do you know how we had children?

197
00:22:13.960 --> 00:22:21.600
- You turned off the light, undressed you ... - when we talked about having children!

198
00:22:21.760 --> 00:22:29.400
- I want a family like yours!
 - You will get that.
 Give him time.

199
00:22:29.560 --> 00:22:37.200
- Can't you hurry at the Velland?
 - No, then it only takes longer.

200
00:22:39.920 --> 00:22:47.520
For two years Lena has asked me to dry under the bed - and look here!

201
00:22:47.680 --> 00:22:54.920
- Day to go to bed.
 - It was nice to talk to you.

202
00:22:55.080 --> 00:22:58.520
Good night!

203
00:23:00.560 --> 00:23:04.400
–Sara ... —MM?

204
00:23:04.560 --> 00:23:09.080
- Wish out my bed.
 -Oh...

205
00:23:09.240 --> 00:23:12.880
Sorry.
 Good night.

206
00:23:19.200 --> 00:23:25.840
One two three four five.
 This is how all our Sundays will look!

207
00:23:26.000 --> 00:23:32.680
- Why did Sara go so early?
 - She's going to talk to Pontus.

208
00:23:32.840 --> 00:23:39.480
- I only have 2,000. - It's the fun thing about games.

209
00:23:39.640 --> 00:23:43.480
Soon you are up again.

210
00:23:43.640 --> 00:23:47.840
Hit with 6,000, your little rat!

211
00:23:48.000 --> 00:23:51.840
Dad, don't say so!

212
00:23:52.000 --> 00:23:59.440
Max, I'm sorry.
 When I say rat, then I mean ... Bisam rat -

213
00:23:59.600 --> 00:24:04.040
- Which looks like a cute little kangaroo.

214
00:24:04.200 --> 00:24:10.800
- Do you try to say sorry?
 - And improve your general education.

215
00:24:10.960 --> 00:24:18.200
Hello!
 God, what a weekend!
 You really lost something.

216
00:24:18.360 --> 00:24:25.200
We have discussed the depreciation of the bank's property portfolio ...

217
00:24:25.360 --> 00:24:30.000
- How have you had it?
 -Oh oh oh...

218
00:24:30.160 --> 00:24:37.400
We have eaten sushi, visited the shopping city, I have hugged Banarne ...

219
00:24:37.560 --> 00:24:44.560
- What is you say now?
 - The tracks!
 Trazan Apansson's friend!

220
00:24:45.720 --> 00:24:51.560
- We have had great fun.
 - Yes, Sara got up to you.

221
00:24:51.720 --> 00:24:57.360
- Day for the next event!
 - Purchase city?

222
00:24:57.520 --> 00:25:04.560
Wrong speed!
 Now you should experience excitement, joy, drama ...

223
00:25:06.320 --> 00:25:09.960
We will play poker.

224
00:25:12.440 --> 00:25:19.680
- Gustav ... you play every weekend.
 - I, yes, but not you!

225
00:25:19.840 --> 00:25:25.880
Nothing goes up to sitting in Pettersson's garage!

226
00:25:26.040 --> 00:25:32.280
- We don't play poker.
 - But they have a nice garage.

227
00:25:34.240 --> 00:25:40.000
- Where is our wedding photo?
 - I then explain.

228
00:26:16.360 --> 00:26:18.800
