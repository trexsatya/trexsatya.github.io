1
00:00:00,034 --> 00:00:02,500
"Mom, mom! Can't we buy the frozen?"

2
00:00:02,570 --> 00:00:03,739
I'm so bitter.

3
00:00:03,993 --> 00:00:04,755
(Proprut sounds)

4
00:00:04,893 --> 00:00:06,826
- Five!
 - Wooo!

5
00:00:07,457 --> 00:00:09,808
- Balalajka!
 Hello, hey!
 - Balalajka!

6
00:00:17,182 --> 00:00:20,566
Hello Hello!

7
00:00:20,888 --> 00:00:24,608
Today we will test ice cream!

8
00:00:24,759 --> 00:00:25,856
(Axis) mmm.

9
00:00:25,993 --> 00:00:36,470
You who have followed our channel for a while know that we test this year's ice cream news every year.

10
00:00:36,604 --> 00:00:38,326
Yes!

11
00:00:38,580 --> 00:00:43,585
Here in Portugal GB is called Glass, Olá.

12
00:00:43,816 --> 00:00:46,737
- Olá!
 - Olá!

13
00:00:47,181 --> 00:00:52,364
- Olá has quite as ice cream news as GB at home in Sweden.
 - Yes.

14
00:00:52,520 --> 00:00:59,126
But not quite.
 So, it will be News of the Year here in Portugal, but pretty much is the same as in Sweden.

15
00:00:59,293 --> 00:01:00,127
Yes.

16
00:01:00,194 --> 00:01:02,129
- Are you ready?
 - Yeah!

17
00:01:02,262 --> 00:01:03,131
Let's go!

18
00:01:03,408 --> 00:01:06,278
"Frozen Snowflake Cone"

19
00:01:06,578 --> 00:01:09,003
It looks like this.

20
00:01:09,929 --> 00:01:17,057
- Yes, Mom ... Laura has played a little with yours.
 - Yes, mine is beaten.

21
00:01:17,288 --> 00:01:19,679
Laura didn't like yours.

22
00:01:19,910 --> 00:01:25,213
The ice cream melts quickly here in Portugal, so now we have to munch.

23
00:01:25,352 --> 00:01:27,755
Oh, Laura absolutely wants to munch.

24
00:01:27,822 --> 00:01:30,424
- It feels pretty small.
 - Can she start?
 Or, should we start?

25
00:01:30,491 --> 00:01:32,726
- Doesn't it feel a little small?
 - It feels very small!

26
00:01:32,793 --> 00:01:36,334
- tiny ice cream.
 - So, we drive.

27
00:01:39,533 --> 00:01:41,235
Oh, Laura ...

28
00:01:41,317 --> 00:01:45,428
- Yes, she loved it!
 - She will be so dirty after this, I feel it on me.

29
00:01:45,682 --> 00:01:48,001
Can I taste too?

30
00:01:48,255 --> 00:01:51,345
It is blueberry ice cream.
 Super good.

31
00:01:51,622 --> 00:01:53,298
(Harry) nom, nom, nom.

32
00:01:53,455 --> 00:01:56,584
Oh, Laura is not visible in the camera.

33
00:01:56,717 --> 00:02:01,090
Maybe was just as good.
 She doesn't have such a good table.

34
00:02:01,367 --> 00:02:08,204
I like the taste, and I like the aftertaste, so this one was, etc., actually very good.

35
00:02:08,481 --> 00:02:12,328
What points do you give from 1-5?

36
00:02:12,582 --> 00:02:17,431
- I give a strong 3rd.
 - (Joanna) oooh ...

37
00:02:17,775 --> 00:02:21,285
- I give a 3rd.
 - I also give a 3rd.

38
00:02:21,562 --> 00:02:25,534
- Dad, you ate up your whole.
 - Yes.
 Mums!

39
00:02:25,788 --> 00:02:30,351
I think Laura gives a 5th.

40
00:02:30,629 --> 00:02:33,263
And I give a 2nd.

41
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:37,191
- Check out how much Laura has eaten.
 - I know.
 She is completely crazy about this.

42
00:02:37,358 --> 00:02:41,862
But I actually think it was a "toddler ice cream".
 Can you say so?

43
00:02:41,941 --> 00:02:50,464
Yes.
 It is one of this kind of kind when you go to kindergarten, you just: "Mom, mom, can't we buy frozen snowflake cone?"

44
00:02:50,604 --> 00:02:54,241
- And so it was actually the right size for a smaller child.
 - Yes.

45
00:02:54,408 --> 00:02:56,758
- But, good taste.
 - Yes.

46
00:02:57,150 --> 00:02:59,393
“Solero pineapple”

47
00:02:59,670 --> 00:03:02,940
It's an ice cream that looks like this.

48
00:03:03,267 --> 00:03:06,620
This ice cream is not in Sweden.

49
00:03:06,764 --> 00:03:14,036
- Laura ... - You can't cheat!
 She tasted a little.

50
00:03:14,361 --> 00:03:18,499
- Should we others drive, then?
 - Yes.

51
00:03:20,474 --> 00:03:24,231
(Harry + Joanna + Axel) Mmm.

52
00:03:24,499 --> 00:03:28,342
- Very pineapple.
 - Very pineapple.

53
00:03:28,509 --> 00:03:30,050
(Harry) I like it.

54
00:03:30,212 --> 00:03:36,208
It says that the pineapple comes from the Azores.
 It is a Portuguese archipelago that we really want to go to.

55
00:03:36,461 --> 00:03:40,850
- Right.
 - Oooh!
 Flabby.

56
00:03:41,173 --> 00:03:48,711
- Yes, it's like a little jelly.
 - Yes.
 It is not like a piggelin - a hard ice cream.

57
00:03:51,844 --> 00:03:54,466
Yes, you like it.

58
00:03:54,735 --> 00:03:57,671
I give this 3.5.

59
00:03:57,838 --> 00:04:07,115
I think it was a delicious ice cream, but it was a bit of a shame that it melted ... or, that it became cordial, so fast.

60
00:04:07,347 --> 00:04:11,873
I give this ice cream 3 points.
 I thought it was totally okay.

61
00:04:12,019 --> 00:04:16,223
Laura seems to love it.
 Is it a 4th or a 5th?

62
00:04:16,501 --> 00:04:20,561
I like this very much, so I give this a 5th.

63
00:04:20,728 --> 00:04:22,896
The first 5th of the day.

64
00:04:23,030 --> 00:04:30,001
- If you don't count on Pipitas 5th on that snowflake ... - Just that!
 But is her point counted?

65
00:04:30,232 --> 00:04:32,439
- No.
 - No, we find them.

66
00:04:32,531 --> 00:04:37,344
She seems to like all the ice cream.
 She sits and knows it with her whole body here.
 She has really smeared.

67
00:04:37,511 --> 00:04:42,198
(Joanna) Aaaah!
 I give 3 points.

68
00:04:42,936 --> 00:04:45,418
“Magnum Almond Remix”

69
00:04:45,972 --> 00:04:50,379
It looks like this.
 It is dipped in white and brown chocolate.

70
00:04:50,691 --> 00:04:57,030
Dad, you said "white and brown chocolate".
 All chocolate is brown?

71
00:04:57,164 --> 00:05:02,069
Yes, if it is not dark - which we call "gubb chocolate" - or white.

72
00:05:02,336 --> 00:05:06,140
- But what do you say then?
 Don't you say "brown chocolate"?
 - "Milk chocolate", you say well?

73
00:05:06,236 --> 00:05:12,530
What do you say?
 Comment below!

74
00:05:12,876 --> 00:05:16,793
I think they are super -ridiculous.
 They mock me because I say "brown chocolate".

75
00:05:16,950 --> 00:05:21,674
(Alma) and like: a if you think you say "brown chocolate" ...

76
00:05:21,788 --> 00:05:24,798
- No, then we get no likes!
 - ... like a little comfort to Dad.

77
00:05:24,858 --> 00:05:28,019
Okay, like: A if you don't think you should say ...

78
00:05:28,061 --> 00:05:33,623
- Like: a if you like the video.
 So we do, for the sake of simplicity.
 - Yes.
 Like: a.

79
00:05:33,767 --> 00:05:36,107
Like: A anyway.

80
00:05:36,245 --> 00:05:39,554
- Balalajka.
 Come on, now we drive!
 - Balalajka!
 Hello, hey!

81
00:05:39,716 --> 00:05:41,938
Balalaika!

82
00:05:43,011 --> 00:05:46,317
- (Joanna) Mmmm!
 - I just suck on it.

83
00:05:46,502 --> 00:05:48,615
Why?
 It is delicious!
 Chew.

84
00:05:48,782 --> 00:05:55,155
Well, now I understand.
 The whole ice cream is dipped in white chocolate and almond, and then half the ice cream is dipped in ...

85
00:05:55,222 --> 00:05:58,125
- Brown ... - ... brown chocolate.

86
00:05:58,206 --> 00:06:00,827
It tastes almond cube inside.

87
00:06:01,007 --> 00:06:07,725
I actually cheated.
 I've tested this before, a day on the beach.
 I love this one!

88
00:06:08,521 --> 00:06:13,086
Almond cube and white chocolate.
 So, you hear.
 What are I living with?

89
00:06:13,202 --> 00:06:14,577
It is fantastic!

90
00:06:14,901 --> 00:06:19,798
- (shoulder) The apple does not fall that far from the tree.
 - No.
 That's good, Laura.

91
00:06:19,947 --> 00:06:23,350
Good taste.
 What do you think others?

92
00:06:23,483 --> 00:06:28,689
Well, I don't like this one.
 I don't like almonds that much, so I don't like this one.

93
00:06:28,855 --> 00:06:31,792
I give this ... 1 point.

94
00:06:31,892 --> 00:06:34,962
- I think it was totally okay.
 - One?
 Oh.

95
00:06:35,028 --> 00:06:37,061
- What do you give, then?
 - Zero.

96
00:06:37,097 --> 00:06:38,599
- huh?!
 - Zero?!

97
00:06:38,652 --> 00:06:43,403
Zero, zero, zero, zero, nooooll!

98
00:06:43,630 --> 00:06:47,631
You are crazy!
 You are crazy!

99
00:06:47,839 --> 00:06:52,706
Okay.
 I think this is a little retirement ice cream ...

100
00:06:52,936 --> 00:06:56,997
- Thanks.
 - ... but I give it 2 points.

101
00:06:57,184 --> 00:07:00,520
Laura and I give clear 5s.

102
00:07:00,854 --> 00:07:02,981
“Calippo lime”

103
00:07:03,442 --> 00:07:06,760
This one probably everyone knows what it looks like.

104
00:07:10,152 --> 00:07:13,575
- Very lime.
 - mm.

105
00:07:14,607 --> 00:07:16,607
Oh...

106
00:07:17,586 --> 00:07:22,251
- Top on a hot summer day!
 - Aaah!
 My hands!

107
00:07:22,476 --> 00:07:27,676
- What?
 What is it?
 - It's so cold by hand.

108
00:07:29,044 --> 00:07:31,413
Aaaah!

109
00:07:32,401 --> 00:07:39,141
- I like this one.
 - They have frozen together.
 They can't move.

110
00:07:41,663 --> 00:07:44,164
The sugar is starting to get up in the heads of them.

111
00:07:44,297 --> 00:07:50,003
Yes, it goes so fast.
 I also feel much nicer.
 I was a little tired when we started recording.
 Now, just, "ding-dong"!

112
00:07:50,170 --> 00:07:52,806
Yes, really "ding-dong".
 Or it depends ...

113
00:07:52,881 --> 00:07:58,410
-♪ "pure frame ding-dong, came all the nicke doll with us!"
 ♪ - Nämen ... Not the one.

114
00:07:58,712 --> 00:08:01,332
♪ "pure frame ding-dong!"
 ♪

115
00:08:01,586 --> 00:08:03,683
Oh my God.

116
00:08:03,850 --> 00:08:11,516
Not only are you forced to look at the Melodifestivalen over the years, you should also have to hear those odors to songs.

117
00:08:11,658 --> 00:08:15,062
- Stop being so bitter.
 - I'm so bitter.

118
00:08:15,241 --> 00:08:18,001
They are great!

119
00:08:18,131 --> 00:08:21,957
What do you think about the ice cream, then?
 That's the one we're going to talk about.

120
00:08:22,335 --> 00:08:28,474
When I eat this ice cream, my tongue contracts, much like I drink something chemical.

121
00:08:28,675 --> 00:08:31,211
But it feels like it contains a lot of energy.

122
00:08:31,278 --> 00:08:34,614
It feels like you drink something that makes you super fast, kind of.

123
00:08:34,774 --> 00:08:38,967
Look at me, then!
 Zoom, zoom, zoom ...

124
00:08:39,319 --> 00:08:47,897
- "Zoom, zoom."
 What is he doing?
 - They don't see you.
 He lies and spins here on the floor.

125
00:08:48,162 --> 00:08:53,533
- I give this ice cream 3.5 points.
 - Zoom, zoom, zoom ...

126
00:08:53,700 --> 00:08:59,573
- I give it 2 points.
 Laura might give ... 3. - Yes.

127
00:08:59,706 --> 00:09:02,509
Zoom, zoom, zoom ...

128
00:09:02,676 --> 00:09:07,405
Gosh!
 Put away my paddle racket.

129
00:09:08,490 --> 00:09:10,182
Alma, what do you give?

130
00:09:10,297 --> 00:09:12,571
- Zoom!
 - Gosh!

131
00:09:12,853 --> 00:09:18,525
I give 2 points.
 I also think it feels a little chemical, if I may say it myself.

132
00:09:18,710 --> 00:09:21,361
But it is nice on a warm and sunny day.

133
00:09:21,486 --> 00:09:22,710
Zoom, zoom!

134
00:09:22,894 --> 00:09:25,232
- What are you doing?
 - Come and give points.

135
00:09:25,365 --> 00:09:28,459
- Okay sure.
 - Listen, zoom-o.

136
00:09:28,602 --> 00:09:32,636
That one must not be here, because Laura will do so it will be very dirty.

137
00:09:32,706 --> 00:09:37,177
"Hello then," we tell the rabbit.
 So!
 Harry's score.

138
00:09:37,536 --> 00:09:39,512
Zoom, zoom.

139
00:09:39,693 --> 00:09:42,233
- forward.
 - Zoom, zoom!

140
00:09:42,515 --> 00:09:45,627
"Salted Caramel Brownie Peace Pop"

141
00:09:45,852 --> 00:09:50,383
It's an ice cream on a stick that looks like this.

142
00:09:50,641 --> 00:09:53,891
- (Joanna) Now Laura comes to take it.
 - (laughter)

143
00:09:54,101 --> 00:09:58,985
This is also a news in Sweden this year.

144
00:09:59,239 --> 00:10:03,864
- Exciting.
 - Very exciting.

145
00:10:04,004 --> 00:10:05,939
- Are you ready?
 - Yes!

146
00:10:06,006 --> 00:10:08,208
Let's go.

147
00:10:10,811 --> 00:10:12,612
(Joanna + Axel) Mmm.

148
00:10:12,747 --> 00:10:19,083
- Oh, what a lot of taste.
 - What salt it was.
 Do you want to taste?

149
00:10:19,637 --> 00:10:23,539
Oh, it was like ... there was so much in this one.

150
00:10:23,885 --> 00:10:26,226
Yes, you liked it.

151
00:10:26,393 --> 00:10:34,049
- Almost like Arne's brine.
 - huh?!
 After all, it is not even like anything with brine.

152
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:38,772
- Arnes brine.
 - What was it from?
 What is that?

153
00:10:38,838 --> 00:10:43,559
- I think it was a news last year from Sia or Triumf.
 - Arnes ...

154
00:10:43,790 --> 00:10:51,045
- Don't you remember when I kind of spit?
 - Yes exactly.
 Uncle Arne.

155
00:10:51,651 --> 00:10:56,056
- Down here in Portugal, brine ice cream would never work.
 - No.

156
00:10:56,122 --> 00:11:03,930
GB has a brine chalk ... or, at least a licorice ice cream, as news in Sweden, but no Portuguese would buy it, ever!

157
00:11:04,030 --> 00:11:08,001
- They don't eat licorice down here.
 They don't eat candy ... - No.

158
00:11:08,168 --> 00:11:13,506
They have a completely different culture around sweets.

159
00:11:13,940 --> 00:11:19,679
The caramel was very, very salty.
 So, a little type for salt.

160
00:11:20,013 --> 00:11:23,796
When I bit in it I kind of got a shock because it was so salty.

161
00:11:23,983 --> 00:11:28,355
It feels like a strange mix.

162
00:11:28,521 --> 00:11:36,196
"Brownie and Salted Caramel", and ice cream, too.
 It was very much in one.

163
00:11:36,363 --> 00:11:39,199
Mm.
 A little bit of everything.

164
00:11:39,632 --> 00:11:42,854
It is a chicken that has stepped on mine.

165
00:11:43,002 --> 00:11:49,719
It's the Peace sign, Harry ... that looks like a chicken foot.

166
00:11:51,264 --> 00:11:55,815
I give this ice cream ... 2 points.

167
00:11:55,882 --> 00:12:00,420
I think it was too much in one.
 It was a strange mix.

168
00:12:00,553 --> 00:12:04,357
- I get it.
 - I give this zero-superhero.

169
00:12:04,476 --> 00:12:08,764
- Zero?!
 - "Scanner Eyes."

170
00:12:08,928 --> 00:12:12,832
- He doesn't like chocolate ice cream.
 - No.
 There are second zero Harry today.

171
00:12:12,932 --> 00:12:21,184
- Harry doesn't like "Salted Caramel".
 - Aha.
 I give 4 points.
 What does Laura give?

172
00:12:21,586 --> 00:12:23,943
- Five!
 - Wooo!

173
00:12:24,254 --> 00:12:29,682
- What is this?
 - I spilled Calippo Lemon.

174
00:12:29,849 --> 00:12:37,921
- You made the classic mistake and turned it.
 - not "lemon" - "lime".
 Calippo lime.
 Not "lemon".

175
00:12:37,991 --> 00:12:41,694
- "Don't do it."
 Never turn a Calippo upside down.
 - No.

176
00:12:41,793 --> 00:12:47,200
We have a question of the day.
 Alma, you are here, because it is for you.

177
00:12:47,367 --> 00:12:49,669
Okay.
 Yeah!

178
00:12:49,836 --> 00:12:54,340
"Will Alma make a movie about Portugal?"

179
00:12:54,674 --> 00:13:00,747
- Yes, I will!
 - Yes, she will!
 Pipito is included!

180
00:13:01,009 --> 00:13:03,116
Yes, I will.

181
00:13:03,260 --> 00:13:05,585
- Yes, you will?
 - Yes!

182
00:13:05,718 --> 00:13:10,956
- When should it be finished, then?
 - I don't really know, but there will be one.

183
00:13:11,134 --> 00:13:13,374
Keep an eye on Alma's channel.

184
00:13:13,668 --> 00:13:16,545
"Solero Barrinha Manga"

185
00:13:16,863 --> 00:13:24,389
It looks like this.
 If you translate "Barrinha", it means "barbell" in Swedish.

186
00:13:24,837 --> 00:13:30,675
- In Sweden, a new sandwich ice cream has come out.
 - A new taste on sandwich.

187
00:13:30,810 --> 00:13:35,181
Yes exactly.
 This is Portugal's version on Sandwich.

188
00:13:35,515 --> 00:13:41,256
Very difficulty, because it doesn't have this ... The bread itself, or what to say.

189
00:13:41,354 --> 00:13:46,966
Just.
 It's not a sandwich, it's just the inside measurement.

190
00:13:48,951 --> 00:13:53,218
It is mango and vanilla ice cream.

191
00:13:56,434 --> 00:14:06,246
This feels like an ice cream you have come up with at the last second to be able to fill this ... The sign with news.

192
00:14:06,279 --> 00:14:07,240
Gosh.

193
00:14:07,247 --> 00:14:11,684
It is an ice cream that is easy to make, but completely impossible to eat.

194
00:14:11,860 --> 00:14:16,309
The white vanilla melts faster than the yellow mango, so it is completely ...

195
00:14:16,489 --> 00:14:19,092
It is very unclear why it is not on a stick.

196
00:14:19,209 --> 00:14:24,530
It will only be a giggle of it when you buy it, so I think no one will buy this one.

197
00:14:24,909 --> 00:14:30,301
- I like it.
 I give it a strong 3rd.
 - (Joanna) A strong 3rd.

198
00:14:30,601 --> 00:14:39,738
It took a little while for me to, like, understand if this was ice cream or if it was real mango.

199
00:14:40,015 --> 00:14:43,351
- Well, you thought it was so mango -like?
 - mm.

200
00:14:43,516 --> 00:14:49,355
Pipita is just demonstrating what it will look like when people eat this ice cream in the summer.

201
00:14:49,522 --> 00:14:53,750
It will be an orgy of ice cream.

202
00:14:53,893 --> 00:14:58,352
Yes, horrible.
 I give 1 point.
 A weak 1st.

203
00:14:58,998 --> 00:15:04,047
I give a strong 4th.
 No...

204
00:15:04,170 --> 00:15:08,875
- You have on the upper lip ... - No, a 4th only.
 Not strong.

205
00:15:09,033 --> 00:15:11,888
4 points?

206
00:15:13,256 --> 00:15:19,607
I give this 0 points.
 A really, really zero zero.

207
00:15:19,919 --> 00:15:21,979
“Cornetto Rose”

208
00:15:22,325 --> 00:15:26,110
It looks like this.
 Like a rose.

209
00:15:26,410 --> 00:15:33,299
This is not a news in Sweden this year.
 It says it is "Raspberry Milkshake Flavor".

210
00:15:33,576 --> 00:15:39,875
It is thus raspberry mile shake flavor.
 Okay, are you prepared?

211
00:15:40,152 --> 00:15:42,439
1, 2, 3!

212
00:15:44,879 --> 00:15:47,664
- (Harry) Mmm.
 - (shoulder) mm.

213
00:15:48,241 --> 00:15:51,857
(Harry) mm, mm, mm, mm.

214
00:15:52,131 --> 00:15:53,419
Good raspberry flavor.

215
00:15:53,553 --> 00:15:58,100
It was better than I thought.
 When it said "Milkshake" I was a little scared.

216
00:15:58,357 --> 00:16:02,361
- Me too.
 - No, Laura!
 What have you done?

217
00:16:02,528 --> 00:16:08,747
When it said "Milkshake", I became sure this would be my 5th.

218
00:16:09,116 --> 00:16:12,338
Yes, it says something about your starting point.

219
00:16:15,104 --> 00:16:18,000
Laura likes this one.

220
00:16:18,468 --> 00:16:21,540
Oh, what she jaws.

221
00:16:22,532 --> 00:16:27,445
She has come to a family that loves ice cream.
 We are all "ice cream lover".

222
00:16:27,612 --> 00:16:32,024
So, I love this ice cream!
 This was the best ice cream we have tested.

223
00:16:32,091 --> 00:16:34,494
- Is it true?!
 - Strong, strong, strong 5th.

224
00:16:34,564 --> 00:16:38,108
- So you think this one should come to Sweden?
 - Yes!

225
00:16:38,267 --> 00:16:43,599
- (Laura) ma, ma, ma, ma, ma ... - (shoulder) Yes.
 How many points?

226
00:16:43,736 --> 00:16:44,373
(Proprut sounds)

227
00:16:44,904 --> 00:16:47,285
Oh oh oh!
 That was a lot.

228
00:16:47,340 --> 00:16:52,645
- She held her whole hand.
 It was a 5th from Laura.
 - Yes, I think so.
 Was it the best ice cream?

229
00:16:52,740 --> 00:16:57,021
Good, Laura!
 Great, there!
 You have my taste.
 Good taste, that is.

230
00:16:57,229 --> 00:17:00,313
- I give 3 points.
 - I also give 3 points.

231
00:17:00,521 --> 00:17:01,618
I give 3 points.

232
00:17:01,754 --> 00:17:05,983
- This was the last ice cream news!
 - Yes.

233
00:17:06,168 --> 00:17:13,199
In summary, you can say that here in Portugal there are more fruit flavors than chocolate.

234
00:17:13,366 --> 00:17:18,004
- Yes.
 Than chocolate and soft ice cream and stuff.
 - Yes exactly.

235
00:17:18,137 --> 00:17:22,708
Like Cornetto Soft, it is not here in Portugal.
 In any case, the new Cornetto soft.

236
00:17:22,842 --> 00:17:24,343
Or Cornetto Dragon.

237
00:17:24,510 --> 00:17:27,680
No, it doesn't exist.
 I don't know if it remains in Sweden either?

238
00:17:27,847 --> 00:17:31,517
- No, but it's really good.
 - Yes, you like it.

239
00:17:31,695 --> 00:17:34,153
Hope you liked the video!

240
00:17:34,287 --> 00:17:40,378
Yes!
 And if you come to Portugal you can always test these ice creams.

241
00:17:40,955 --> 00:17:48,046
Thanks for watching this video!

242
00:17:48,300 --> 00:17:54,374
- Feel free to leave a thumbs up, or down.
 - Most thumbs up!

243
00:17:54,540 --> 00:17:58,110
Comment, ask questions and have a great time until we see you next time.

244
00:17:58,210 --> 00:18:00,513
Bye!
