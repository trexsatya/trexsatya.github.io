 - Yes, I also knew it.

3
00:00:18,540 --> 00:00:21,060
Hello Hello!

4
00:00:21,200 --> 00:00:23,720
Today we will test candy from ...

5
00:00:23,720 --> 00:00:25,920
Finland!

6
00:00:26,100 --> 00:00:29,520
Where you invent things.

7
00:00:29,680 --> 00:00:31,680
Oh really?
 Yes maybe.

8
00:00:31,680 --> 00:00:40,460
In our most recent postal opener video we got Finnish candy sent to us by a nice viewer in Finland, named Ingrid.

9
00:00:40,660 --> 00:00:45,420
She asked if we wanted to test Finnish candy and we said "Yes!".

10
00:00:45,540 --> 00:00:52,740
A short time later, this appeared with "Posti".

11
00:00:54,680 --> 00:00:57,960
Here's a letter!

12
00:00:58,140 --> 00:01:02,660
This is a package full of Finnish candy-

13
00:01:02,660 --> 00:01:09,260
-Which has been sent to us from Liam and Tindra and their parents Sabrina and Robert.

14
00:01:09,440 --> 00:01:14,700
They live in Ekenäs in Finland, and they want us to test this Finnish candy.

15
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:19,280
- Of course we will do it!
 - So fun!
 Are you ready?

16
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:21,460
- Yes!
 - Yes!
 Here we go!

17
00:01:21,620 --> 00:01:23,860
"Pantteri - Sour Cat"

18
00:01:24,140 --> 00:01:29,280
It is thus jelly candies shaped like the panth faces.

19
00:01:29,500 --> 00:01:33,400
- Should we just choose each color, right?
 - I'll take this yellow.

20
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:35,880
- I take pink.
 - I'll take this.

21
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:39,300
- Orange.
 What is left for me, then?
 - Green or black.

22
00:01:39,300 --> 00:01:41,720
I'll take a green this time.

23
00:01:41,720 --> 00:01:43,300
- Are you ready?
 - Yes!

24
00:01:43,300 --> 00:01:46,660
1, 2, 3 ...

25
00:01:53,060 --> 00:02:00,080
- fruity.
 Pretty cute, not so angry.
 - No!
 "Sour Cat" - I didn't think it was so angry.

26
00:02:00,280 --> 00:02:02,100
Oh...

27
00:02:02,300 --> 00:02:05,720
Harry seems to like it.

28
00:02:06,180 --> 00:02:09,220
No, Harry ...

29
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:15,640
- He runs one like that ... "Flappity-Flap Man".
 - Nämen, Help!
 What does this mean?

30
00:02:15,640 --> 00:02:18,680
- Scatman?
 - I do not know.

31
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:22,780
- I flew away.
 - You flew away.
 Was it so good?

32
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:27,880
- You must not taste.
 Viewers get crazy.
 - Oh, sorry.

33
00:02:28,020 --> 00:02:31,780
We get comments about it every time we test sweets.

34
00:02:31,780 --> 00:02:38,340
If you bother with our smoker, I really apologize.
 It is difficult to avoid.

35
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:43,800
What points do you give from 1-5?

36
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:46,340
Harry begins.

37
00:02:46,540 --> 00:02:49,400
- 4. - 5+.

38
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:54,340
- 5+, wow.
 3.5.
 - 3.

39
00:02:54,700 --> 00:02:55,880
“Suffeli”

40
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:59,260
It is thus a chocolate dipped biscuit.

41
00:03:03,460 --> 00:03:06,760
Oh, it's caramel in.

42
00:03:06,760 --> 00:03:12,720
- It tastes like regular biscuit chocolate.
 - Najs!
 So, I have eaten so very boring biscuits.

43
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:15,020
This one is much better than biscuit chocolate, Harry.

44
00:03:15,020 --> 00:03:20,900
This one was much better than those where robbery you can buy in the bag as well.
 It was really good.

45
00:03:20,940 --> 00:03:22,020
Ronald?!

46
00:03:22,100 --> 00:03:26,500
- There is something white here too.
 - It's something foam-foam, or something.

47
00:03:26,620 --> 00:03:33,080
I thought, from 1-5 ... so I thought ...

48
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:39,180
Maybe ... oh, I think, I think.

49
00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:41,040
Two fives.

50
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:42,600
- Two fives?
 - Yes.

51
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:43,860
Oh, wow.

52
00:03:43,860 --> 00:03:48,760
I thought 5+ again, and I thought it was so good!

53
00:03:48,920 --> 00:03:53,020
- Yes.
 Me too.
 - I thought so too.
 5 from me.

54
00:03:53,160 --> 00:03:55,300
4 from me.

55
00:03:55,420 --> 00:03:58,100
- Almost a full pot.
 - Almost.

56
00:03:58,100 --> 00:04:00,360
Potters?

57
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:05,860
- You say "full pot".
 - Well, I thought you meant a full pot.

58
00:04:05,860 --> 00:04:09,900
- "Almost a full pot".
 No.
 - No, absolutely no full pot.

59
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:14,720
Don't forget to push a thumbs up if you like when we test sweets.

60
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:16,500
“Pepe”

61
00:04:16,660 --> 00:04:19,300
It is a soft licorice bar.

62
00:04:19,520 --> 00:04:22,440
I ate like this when I was a kid, I know it's really good.

63
00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:25,240
Or, I thought so anyway.
 It's sweet chalk.

64
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:28,880
- Eww ... - It's super good!

65
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:32,960
It looks like the world's longest cigarette.

66
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:39,620
- Cigarettes are usually not black.
 - And you don't usually blow them.

67
00:04:46,640 --> 00:04:51,220
- Good texture on licorice, I think.
 - Super good.
 Nam, Nam.

68
00:04:51,220 --> 00:04:54,480
Hörrududu!

69
00:04:55,480 --> 00:04:58,680
Don't try, Harry.

70
00:05:02,280 --> 00:05:05,520
Awesome, Harry.
 Good work.

71
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:12,120
- Gosh!
 - So ... what's wrong with you?

72
00:05:14,940 --> 00:05:21,700
It sounds like he spits down my neck, but he doesn't.
 We have a sink behind it.

73
00:05:23,540 --> 00:05:28,520
So, how can you not like sweet chalk?

74
00:05:30,680 --> 00:05:34,600
- It was delicious.
 - I also think it was good.

75
00:05:34,820 --> 00:05:41,040
I don't like licorice because it's black, disgusting, sticky, long ...

76
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:42,420
(Harry Hickar)

77
00:05:42,420 --> 00:05:44,880
Oh.
 Hick.

78
00:05:45,140 --> 00:05:46,460
It's disgusting!

79
00:05:46,460 --> 00:05:54,140
I don't like licorice because it's like salty and sweet in one, and it's like "berry" and ...

80
00:05:54,140 --> 00:05:59,980
- "Bearing"?!
 - A "berry" taste.
 Wondering what it is.

81
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:03,760
Ah ... you have not understood the good of life.

82
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:11,540
Or maybe a snail ... a slimy snail mixed with pudding.

83
00:06:11,740 --> 00:06:15,320
So, is it only our children who do not like licorice?

84
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:21,800
How is it at your house, if you have children at home or if you are a child and watch.

85
00:06:21,980 --> 00:06:25,340
Do you like licorice or not?

 Mint, good.

There are small jelly candies in different colors and they are shaped as letters.

- I think you say "Ässä".
 - But what was I saying?

It is thus milk chocolate.

126

Finnish equivalent of Marabou.

127

- Though a little more boring.
 - Do you think.

128

I think it is a bit more boring.
 It tastes a little more type ... hot chocolate.

 - Absolutely!
 It is okay.

We really want to go to Finland.
 So can we summarize it?
 Would love to go all over Finland.

There are letters on all these.
 They like letter candies in Finland.

168
00:12:04,980 --> 00:12:05,940
I think.

169
00:12:06,120 --> 00:12:11,200
I think this candy was like a boring good & mixed.
 I give it 1 point.

170
00:12:11,260 --> 00:12:13,260
I give it 2 points.

171
00:12:13,260 --> 00:12:14,840
- 1. - 2.

172
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:16,880
"Jim Bites"

173
00:12:16,960 --> 00:12:21,520
It is a piece of chocolate with white filling.

174
00:12:24,180 --> 00:12:29,200
- It's like ... foamy, a little.
 - Nämen Fy ...

175
00:12:29,420 --> 00:12:36,960
- It's some strange foam taste after all.
 - It's like a really bad foam candy.

176
00:12:37,560 --> 00:12:42,720
- Oh, a little angry, type.
 - I think it tastes a little ... almost a little alcohol.

177
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:47,840
Come up in the wrong place.
 Uh-Oh ...

178
00:12:48,040 --> 00:12:51,500
- So, what is happening?
 - I do not know.

179
00:12:51,500 --> 00:12:55,480
Now it is tracking out here.
 What do you do?

180
00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:59,200
- They spit out the candy.
 - Well.

181
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:03,320
♪ I ... give ... zero ... points!
 ♪

182
00:13:03,540 --> 00:13:06,240
♪ Zero ... ♪

183
00:13:07,480 --> 00:13:11,660
♪ I give zero, swimmers, swim around ... ♪

184
00:13:11,900 --> 00:13:15,100
- I give 1 point.
 - And I give 1 point.

185
00:13:15,540 --> 00:13:16,780
"Gifu"

186
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:19,920
There are small black pastils.

187
00:13:23,320 --> 00:13:27,040
- To hard.
 - It's Viol flavor!

188
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:32,240
- Yes it is!
 - I thought it was delicious.

189
00:13:33,860 --> 00:13:37,980
Take it easy!
 You have to feel the taste before you start reacting.

190
00:13:37,980 --> 00:13:41,480
You have to chew on it properly.

191
00:13:42,620 --> 00:13:49,620
I liked the Viol flavor when I was little.
 There is a little xylitol in it too, so I don't know if it's a little ... fresh.

192
00:13:49,620 --> 00:13:54,080
- But it's a bit like Läkerol.
 - mm.

193
00:13:54,420 --> 00:13:59,460
- Good for the teeth ... is xylitol.
 - Candy that is good for the teeth ...

194
00:13:59,460 --> 00:14:02,660
- But xylitol is good for the teeth.
 - Yes.

195
00:14:02,660 --> 00:14:05,400
(Harry Banks to something)

196
00:14:06,820 --> 00:14:09,720
- I give 2 points.
 - I give 1 point.

197
00:14:09,900 --> 00:14:12,560
- 1 point.
 - 3 points.

198
00:14:12,900 --> 00:14:14,740
Turkish pepper.

199
00:14:14,980 --> 00:14:20,100
It is a black hard candy that many Swedes have tried.

200
00:14:20,440 --> 00:14:23,840
But not Alma and Harry.

201
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:28,260
- You have to chew on this one.
 - You have to chew it.

202
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:42,680
Turkish pepper that is so good!

203
00:14:43,240 --> 00:14:46,920
Are we not good parents, or huh?

204
00:14:47,100 --> 00:14:51,440
- I don't think it's that dangerous.
 - I love Turkish pepper!
 When I was little too.

205
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:53,200
Yes, it is very wonderful!

206
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:58,860
- So, it burns for real!
 - But it burns in a good way.

207
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:04,040
- Did you break it?
 - Yes!
 It was like a sauce inside with small grains.

208
00:15:04,040 --> 00:15:09,720
No, it's a powder ... just (schhh) in the mouth.

209
00:15:09,840 --> 00:15:13,080
Check out, it's a fire, mmm ... a good fire.

210
00:15:13,080 --> 00:15:17,740
- Harry, did you break yours?
 - No.
 Lucky.

211
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:23,200
- Lucky?
 Yes ... - then you haven't even tasted it for real.

212
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:28,400
A pretty funny candy to have on Halloween when someone comes and knocks on.

213
00:15:28,580 --> 00:15:31,340
I give 4 points.

214
00:15:31,620 --> 00:15:34,120
I give 1 point.

215
00:15:34,300 --> 00:15:36,580
I give 4.5.

216
00:15:36,740 --> 00:15:38,060
Zero!

217
00:15:38,300 --> 00:15:44,140
Thanks for watching this video!

218
00:15:44,340 --> 00:15:49,160
Feel free to leave a thumbs up, or down.

219
00:15:49,300 --> 00:15:50,880
Most thumbs up, mostly thumbs up!

220
00:15:51,020 --> 00:15:54,860
Comment, ask questions and have a great time until we see you next time.

221
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:58,000
Bye!
