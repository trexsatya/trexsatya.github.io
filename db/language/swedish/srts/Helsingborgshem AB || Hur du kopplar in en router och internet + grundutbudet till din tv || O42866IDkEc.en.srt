00:00:02.727 --> 00:00:06.274
Hi, In this movie I was going to show two things:

2
00:00:06.274 --> 00:00:09.251
The first is how you get the internet in your apartment and

3
00:00:09.251 --> 00:00:14.000
And the other is how you get access to the basic range of TV channels.

4
00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000
We start with the internet.

5
00:00:16.261 --> 00:00:19.315
To get the internet so you need a subscription

6
00:00:19.315 --> 00:00:22.311
at any of the available suppliers.

7
00:00:22.601 --> 00:00:26.408
Once you get your equipment home, it's time to start connecting.

8
00:00:26.408 --> 00:00:28.882
First, we will open the media cabinet.

9
00:00:28.882 --> 00:00:32.255
One tip is to use something flat and narrow.

10
00:00:33.377 --> 00:00:36.110
Here in the media cabinet is a fiber box.

11
00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:40.291
There are several network outlets on the underside of the fiber box.

12
00:00:40.862 --> 00:00:45.309
Whether you are going to use a router or just a network cable

13
00:00:45.309 --> 00:00:47.309
So you need to do this step.

14
00:00:49.678 --> 00:00:53.557
Below you plug in one of your network cables

15
00:00:53.557 --> 00:00:57.414
And here to the right is a so -called patch panel.

16
00:00:58.139 --> 00:01:04.907
The numbers that are on the panel correspond to the numbers that are on the outlets in your various rooms.

17
00:01:05.565 --> 00:01:08.256
I want, for example, to have my router in the bedroom.

18
00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:14.763
In this case, I choose withdrawal number five or six that I will use.

19
00:01:17.355 --> 00:01:21.734
When I plug in withdrawal number five on the patch panel into the media cabinet

20
00:01:21.734 --> 00:01:26.423
Is it important that I plug in the network cable into number five in the bedroom.

21
00:01:31.868 --> 00:01:35.643
During the figure on the socket there is a gap you should open.

22
00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:40.399
Here you connect the network cable and connect it to the router.

23
00:01:46.763 --> 00:01:50.924
But how should you do to gain access to the basic range of TV channels?

24
00:01:51.137 --> 00:01:53.137
Well, I'll tell you that.

25
00:01:53.572 --> 00:01:58.666
As a resident of the City Quarter, you have access to Tele2's basic range of TV channels.

26
00:01:58.956 --> 00:02:01.942
The only thing you need to do is contact Tele2 to get

27
00:02:01.942 --> 00:02:05.770
To have the TV hub sent home to you free of charge.
