1
00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:59.520
You have to stop eating in bed!
 Here are the plates I was looking for.

2
00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:05.960
- Someone is in the sauna.
 -What is this?!
 A meatball mask!

3
00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:13.560
Set it!
 Did Max gave me this one for me to do away with it?

4
00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:20.360
You will notice that on the neighbors tomorrow when you pick up the magazine.

5
00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:28.120
Think, tomorrow is New Year's Eve.
 16 of our years together are coming to an end.

6
00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:36.840
You think we should re -evaluate how we have had it and how we should have it.

7
00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:44.640
Yes, I think it's important.
 I want to know.
 How do you look at the future?

8
00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:51.240
I look at the future much like I see on a painting:

9
00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:59.320
Don't know what it represents, who made it ... and is not interested.

10
00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:04.440
- Yeah.
 How old are you?
 –37.

11
00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:11.160
You are 43. And the average life expectancy for a Swedish man is 74 years old.

12
00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:18.840
- You have lived more than half your life.
 - Have you so much further left then?!

13
00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:25.440
Tappations

14
00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:25.440
Come in, max.
 Do you want to lie with us?

15
00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:31.640
- No thanks, it is not necessary.
 - Hi, we don't bother?

16
00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:38.880
- Do Göran and Annika keep in our room?
 - We have to ask you again.

17
00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:43.680
Don't you want to come to a party tomorrow?

18
00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:49.560
It's nice, but the New Year's evenings are sacred.

19
00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:57.080
Please!
 You were the first we met here, and Gustav was so helpful!

20
00:02:57.240 --> 00:03:03.960
- ni mixes him with someone ... –OVa Uddevalla - friends come.

21
00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:10.800
- We want them to meet you.
 - It sounds pretty nice.

22
00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:17.320
Come on now!
 They want to know who you are and what you look like.

23
00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:21.720
Should we lend our photo album?

24
00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:29.040
- Come, Göran.
 It's no idea.
 - No ... - sorry we disturbed.

25
00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:33.640
- Good night on you.
 Hello.
 -Hello!

26
00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:41.160
-Now I'm ashamed.
 They like us.
 - Why are they fucking in the middle of the night then?

27
00:03:41.320 --> 00:03:44.160
Good night.

28
00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:56.320
- Don't eat it.
 - I just have to hold it.

29
00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:13.560
Call, watch ... Call, clock, call ...

30
00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:24.320
Good morning Dad.
 How can you eat ribs and mimosa salad now?

31
00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:33.200
It's my family's New Year's breakfast for generations!
 With new spice this year!

32
00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:38.720
-What then?
 Thinner?
 - Thai Curry.

33
00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:45.120
Grandfather said that a life without adventure is not worth it!

34
00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:52.120
- He was also a postman, huh?
 –And that you and Max will also be.

35
00:04:52.280 --> 00:04:59.520
Dad, may I ask one thing?
 Was your life that you had imagined?

36
00:04:59.680 --> 00:05:04.440
-Yes actually.
 Exactly.
 -Is it true.

37
00:05:04.600 --> 00:05:11.440
I've got everything I wanted.
 A wife and two children who love me.

38
00:05:11.600 --> 00:05:15.960
A work where everyone loves me.

39
00:05:16.120 --> 00:05:23.600
- Then you have to say congratulations ... - waver ... you ponder on the future.

40
00:05:23.760 --> 00:05:31.400
You do this in your age.
 But my grandfather taught me something before he died.

41
00:05:31.560 --> 00:05:36.000
To open a sardine can with one hand.

42
00:05:36.160 --> 00:05:43.160
He looked me in the eyes and said, "Do you no hopes".

43
00:05:45.120 --> 00:05:50.400
- "Then you will never be disappointed."
 -How horrible!

44
00:05:50.560 --> 00:05:58.200
And that's why I've done the opposite.
 You have to believe that everything is possible!

45
00:05:58.360 --> 00:06:03.680
If I find something I want to do, you help me?

46
00:06:03.840 --> 00:06:11.400
- Yes, in 15 years you want to move.
 - Should I move when I'm 30?

47
00:06:11.560 --> 00:06:19.200
It is not useful to stay home anymore.
 But we don't throw you out!

48
00:06:19.360 --> 00:06:21.920
Good morning...

49
00:06:22.080 --> 00:06:26.960
Surely we can celebrate the twelve in the square?

50
00:06:27.120 --> 00:06:31.800
- It seems fun as a change?
 -No.

51
00:06:31.960 --> 00:06:36.600
Have we celebrated here for 16 years ...

52
00:06:36.760 --> 00:06:42.320
--... So we should find something new.
 -They are waiting!

53
00:06:42.480 --> 00:06:48.120
-What are you talking about?
 - We will eat at Göran and Annika.

54
00:06:48.280 --> 00:06:55.120
- For you have made ribs ... –Anika has baked pallets.

55
00:06:55.280 --> 00:06:59.640
-Never in my life!
 - Come, kids.

56
00:06:59.800 --> 00:07:07.240
If I have eaten this food for 16 years, I'll do it today too!

57
00:07:09.120 --> 00:07:11.960
Or in the mornings.

58
00:07:17.640 --> 00:07:23.440
- We will go soon.
 - We don't like Aunt Karin.

59
00:07:23.600 --> 00:07:32.840
She doesn't like you either.
 But on New Year's Eve, the family drinks coffee there.

60
00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:39.920
- I would rather stay home.
 -Me too!
 Uncle Hans smells bad.

61
00:07:40.080 --> 00:07:45.720
Yes.
 Dad is allowed to sit next to him.
 Go and change!

62
00:07:45.880 --> 00:07:50.160
Put on a dress, rope.

63
00:07:51.400 --> 00:07:58.840
Good that you came.
 We will buy flowers on the road.
 Why do you look like that?

64
00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:05.440
This New Year's Eve we will do something new.

65
00:08:05.600 --> 00:08:11.840
- Close us as Norwegian opponents?
 - No ... ski.

66
00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:16.920
-I get it.
 - That I want to not have to go?

67
00:08:17.080 --> 00:08:22.920
- Every year you try to get away!
 - What stupid you look!

68
00:08:23.080 --> 00:08:30.520
- I try to avoid aunt Karin.
 - Once a year is not so dangerous!

69
00:08:30.680 --> 00:08:37.520
- She gets so much fun when you come.
 - She doesn't recognize us!

70
00:08:37.680 --> 00:08:43.880
- Last year I was "Mr. Lagerwall".
 - I can't go ...

71
00:08:44.040 --> 00:08:49.560
You never have to meet Aunt Karin anymore.

72
00:08:49.720 --> 00:08:56.040
- You should not regret it!
 - Mom, we go if you want.

73
00:08:56.200 --> 00:09:04.040
- No, in two minutes Ivanhoe will start.
 - I am the only one who has ideas!

74
00:09:04.200 --> 00:09:10.800
- You only find things you like.
 - Now I understand nothing!

75
00:09:10.960 --> 00:09:18.400
I buy skis, spruce - and video even though I don't know how it works.

76
00:09:18.560 --> 00:09:25.560
- Everything for you to enjoy it!
 - We should do things together, we four.

77
00:09:25.720 --> 00:09:29.560
Or just you two.

78
00:09:29.720 --> 00:09:37.720
It's hard to be a father.
 We want to protect the material standard.

79
00:09:37.880 --> 00:09:44.280
- And the mail hat I got in Christmas?
 - You like clothes ...

80
00:09:44.440 --> 00:09:49.320
Beautiful father and daughter's relationship!

81
00:09:49.480 --> 00:09:57.240
- She is souring for her to live at home.
 - Moving is natural development!

82
00:09:57.400 --> 00:10:05.120
Then they told the EU.
 Now we go to Aunt Karin.
 She does not jaw against.

83
00:10:05.280 --> 00:10:11.840
- It's because she's deaf.
 - Come, Lina.
 Dad has cleared clearly.

84
00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:17.640
That we have to go through the same procedure every year!

85
00:10:24.560 --> 00:10:31.200
- What did the fireworks cost?
 - The main thing is that it becomes beautiful.

86
00:10:31.360 --> 00:10:36.840
- What did they cost?
 - Think when we look out ...

87
00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:41.960
What did the cursed rockets cost?

88
00:10:42.120 --> 00:10:48.600
Two thousand ... but then you got your majesty on the purchase ...

89
00:10:48.760 --> 00:10:55.600
- What did you get, you said?
 -Your Majesty.
 The only thing in the county.

90
00:10:55.760 --> 00:11:00.040
No one has dared to buy it before.

91
00:11:00.200 --> 00:11:05.880
It goes 1 km up and explodes in a cascade of colors.

92
00:11:06.040 --> 00:11:12.560
- It's deadly!
 - A greeting to everyone in Vivalla.

93
00:11:12.720 --> 00:11:17.480
It was nice with Aunt Karin.

94
00:11:17.640 --> 00:11:22.400
It's about inviting yourself.

95
00:11:22.560 --> 00:11:27.800
As she hugged you today!
 What did you say?

96
00:11:27.960 --> 00:11:34.800
- I was Prince Bertil.
 - The main thing is that you had a good time.

97
00:11:34.960 --> 00:11:39.720
I invited her to the fox hunt.

98
00:11:39.880 --> 00:11:43.560
And you got packages!

99
00:11:43.720 --> 00:11:51.160
- Two sacks and a sudde rubber.
 - Yes ... there you see.
 - You then, Lina?

100
00:11:51.320 --> 00:11:54.560
This.

101
00:11:54.720 --> 00:12:00.560
A mixture between a Lovikkavante and a pot.

102
00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:08.840
Well ... Time to make in order.
 Lina can help mom with the food.

103
00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:13.520
- What is it?
 - Hummer and champagne.

104
00:12:13.680 --> 00:12:17.720
No - shrimp and Christmas must as usual.

105
00:12:17.880 --> 00:12:21.960
Max, help me with the firing ramp.

106
00:12:22.120 --> 00:12:25.800
- Hi, Gustav.
 -No...

107
00:12:25.960 --> 00:12:33.400
- We can't go to your party.
 Go home.
 - Göran and I want to talk to you.

108
00:12:33.560 --> 00:12:39.200
- Jobbly!
 I'm waiting outside.
 - We have to ask ...

109
00:12:39.360 --> 00:12:47.000
You have not been able to come to any party.
 Don't you like to spend time with us?

110
00:12:47.160 --> 00:12:53.600
We cannot come today because we have other plans.

111
00:12:53.760 --> 00:12:58.360
And it can happen more times.

112
00:12:58.520 --> 00:13:05.960
It would be a shame if the friendship was destroyed because we cannot be honest.

113
00:13:06.120 --> 00:13:13.440
You are right in that. We should be able to say anything to each other!

114
00:13:13.600 --> 00:13:17.600
Nice that you say so, Gustav!

115
00:13:17.760 --> 00:13:22.200
- What thin -haired you have become.
 –Wa?

116
00:13:22.360 --> 00:13:28.000
I feel I can say that now.
 The flint is visible.

117
00:13:28.160 --> 00:13:32.800
-Come now.
 - We would be honest.

118
00:13:32.960 --> 00:13:36.800
And it was stupid.

119
00:13:36.960 --> 00:13:41.000
Happy new year everyone!

120
00:13:41.560 --> 00:13:47.200
- I have to do something.
 - It's nothing you can do.

121
00:13:47.360 --> 00:13:51.520
- It delays before it falls off.
 - I have to do something now!

122
00:13:53.960 --> 00:13:59.680
Annika!
 The plates we got this morning, they were dry!

123
00:14:00.240 --> 00:14:05.640
Great!
 - There she sees what honesty means!

124
00:14:05.800 --> 00:14:12.240
How she can get up after that, I don't understand that.

125
00:14:19.080 --> 00:14:26.320
- Well, old man, are you satisfied now?
 - I wanted to be there at twelve.

126
00:14:26.480 --> 00:14:32.240
- No one was there!
 - Yes, Fill - Ragnar was there.

127
00:14:32.400 --> 00:14:38.240
Okay, now sit down on the couch, and I'll tell you.

128
00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:46.560
Well ... First, I'll ask you: Do you notice something special?

129
00:14:46.720 --> 00:14:52.440
- Yes, a ketchup spot on the jacket.
 - It's chili sauce.

130
00:14:52.600 --> 00:14:58.440
- Do you mark something else?
 - Do we not use TV?

131
00:14:58.600 --> 00:15:06.400
Right!
 It is now in the garage.
 We'll do something that I dreamed of!

132
00:15:06.560 --> 00:15:10.400
- See on TV in the garage?
 -No...

133
00:15:10.560 --> 00:15:16.800
TV - N has taken up too much of our precious time.

134
00:15:16.960 --> 00:15:21.920
Tonight we will talk to each other.

135
00:15:22.080 --> 00:15:27.120
Sit down!
 Everyone has to invite a little!

136
00:15:27.280 --> 00:15:33.520
On New Year's Eve, I thought you wanted to watch TV.

137
00:15:33.680 --> 00:15:37.520
Calm down, I record everything.

138
00:15:37.680 --> 00:15:45.120
Who feels urged to start?
 Anyone want to tell you about a New Year's promise?

139
00:15:49.080 --> 00:15:53.320
Or something fun to tell?

140
00:15:55.400 --> 00:15:58.960
The word is free!

141
00:15:59.120 --> 00:16:05.960
- It seems nice at Göran.
 - Max!
 - Okay, I can start.

142
00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:15.200
At work on Monday, someone had carried the binders to the conference room.

143
00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:25.640
We had to help carry them back.

144
00:16:29.400 --> 00:16:35.240
Yes, yes ... there you see.
 This can happen in the office.

145
00:16:37.200 --> 00:16:44.520
Thanks, Lena ... - Anyone else who happened to something lately?

146
00:16:44.680 --> 00:16:49.320
Okay, then I can tell you something.

147
00:16:49.480 --> 00:16:57.120
In the post, many people think that we should put the cover material on data.

148
00:17:01.360 --> 00:17:05.960
That's certainly good.
 You win time.

149
00:17:06.120 --> 00:17:11.280
-What are you doing?
 -We are talking!

150
00:17:11.440 --> 00:17:15.960
What do you dream about, Max?

151
00:17:16.120 --> 00:17:21.560
About that there is peace and that the school burns down.

152
00:17:21.720 --> 00:17:26.960
Then we keep our thumbs for it.
 - And you?

153
00:17:27.120 --> 00:17:31.560
About standing in the square in a few hours.

154
00:17:31.720 --> 00:17:37.160
I can crush that dream right away.
 - Yes ...

155
00:17:37.320 --> 00:17:44.760
- This is going well, dad ... - What do you think of such a night?

156
00:17:44.920 --> 00:17:49.360
-Should I be honest?
 -Obvious!

157
00:17:49.520 --> 00:17:53.960
-What are you going to say?
 - You probably expect it.

158
00:17:54.120 --> 00:18:00.040
Max, help me pull in TV - n.
 - You prepare the supper.

159
00:18:00.200 --> 00:18:06.840
- Table the shrimp, you mean?
 - Get the peanut rings and the must.

160
00:18:14.800 --> 00:18:19.400
Shrimp directly from the Arctic Ocean to you ...

161
00:18:19.560 --> 00:18:24.200
... via six months in Konsum's freezer counter.

162
00:18:24.360 --> 00:18:32.200
Imagine, it's strange ... of all millions of shrimp in Antarctica water -

163
00:18:32.360 --> 00:18:41.400
- Ports this one on my plate.
 I wonder if it was predetermined.

164
00:18:41.560 --> 00:18:47.680
- It may be on the packaging ... - This is important!

165
00:18:47.840 --> 00:18:51.680
Is this important?

166
00:18:51.840 --> 00:18:56.280
Maybe not.
 Give me the chili mayonnaise!

167
00:18:56.440 --> 00:19:02.480
- Where is Max?
 - I don't think he wants shrimp.

168
00:19:02.640 --> 00:19:10.760
Something happened when we set up the rockets - he wanted to be for himself.

169
00:19:10.920 --> 00:19:16.560
Don't leave him alone when he starts thinking!

170
00:19:16.720 --> 00:19:23.200
How many shrimp should we add to the max?
 Eight?
 Four?
 Three...

171
00:19:26.440 --> 00:19:33.280
Little old man, are you here?
 Why don't you get down to us?

172
00:19:33.440 --> 00:19:39.800
How did you have it before I and Lina were born?
 Was it more fun?

173
00:19:39.960 --> 00:19:46.200
The old man ... It is clear that everything became more fun when you arrived.

174
00:19:46.360 --> 00:19:53.600
At least more difficult.
 You get a lot to think about ... Why do you ask?

175
00:19:53.760 --> 00:19:59.680
Time goes by so fast.
 I remember the summer when I was six years old.

176
00:19:59.840 --> 00:20:07.800
- I thought you could swim!
 -It's not that.
 Everything was so easy.

177
00:20:07.960 --> 00:20:16.040
We played on the beach, went up and ate and then we could go and play again.

178
00:20:16.200 --> 00:20:21.240
You can still play as much as you want!

179
00:20:21.400 --> 00:20:28.040
No!
 Soon I start high school and then everything is over.

180
00:20:28.200 --> 00:20:32.040
I have to get girlfriend -

181
00:20:32.200 --> 00:20:37.760
- Appeal Roll - On and play drums in some band.

182
00:20:37.920 --> 00:20:45.480
You think too much.
 At your age you do not want to become an adult.
 You learn.

183
00:20:45.640 --> 00:20:52.360
- You can't fight against?
 - That life takes one where it wants.

184
00:20:52.520 --> 00:20:57.760
- To a townhouse in Vivalla?
 -Why not?

185
00:20:57.920 --> 00:21:03.840
I have two wonderful kids, and a man who is okay ...

186
00:21:04.000 --> 00:21:10.240
- Dad has soon eaten the shrimp!
 - Take them up!
 And Dad.

187
00:21:10.400 --> 00:21:14.280
The shrimp is enough.

188
00:21:14.440 --> 00:21:21.800
Max ... once when I was little and low and thought like this ...

189
00:21:21.960 --> 00:21:28.600
--... Then Dad said something very wise.
 -What then?
 "Go to sleep"?

190
00:21:28.760 --> 00:21:36.080
"Life is always next to you and you can do whatever you want with it."

191
00:21:36.240 --> 00:21:42.360
- Here we come with all the shrimp!
 - Watch down, so we eat.

192
00:21:42.520 --> 00:21:47.960
- Mums!
 - How is it, max?
 Are you sad?

193
00:21:48.120 --> 00:21:54.480
- No, it's better now.
 -Good.
 I'll make you really happy!

194
00:21:54.640 --> 00:22:00.480
- Should you go again?
 -No.
 You have longed, and this year ...

195
00:22:01.520 --> 00:22:08.960
You should light up at the fireworks!
 - I'm standing next to them all the time.

196
00:22:09.120 --> 00:22:14.760
That's probably what mom is afraid of ... Three shrimp left.

197
00:22:14.920 --> 00:22:18.440
I can take them!

198
00:22:25.600 --> 00:22:31.520
-Okay, give me another bottle.
 - What are you doing?

199
00:22:31.680 --> 00:22:35.280
Fixes the champagne.

200
00:22:35.440 --> 00:22:41.320
- Selection de Loire and our bag!
 - It can't be drinked.

201
00:22:41.480 --> 00:22:45.920
Well, you can mix it with Trocadero.

202
00:22:46.080 --> 00:22:53.800
- They have started to postpone the rockets!
 - Max, matches!
 And your Majesty!

203
00:22:54.640 --> 00:23:00.240
- You look best from the bedroom.
 -Exciting!

204
00:23:00.400 --> 00:23:07.720
That they can ... What is so fun?
 That it slams?

205
00:23:07.880 --> 00:23:15.320
- It has to do with masculinity.
 - You mean it's idiotic?

206
00:23:15.480 --> 00:23:22.600
Happy New Year!
 I will be nagging dad so you can go on a language trip.

207
00:23:22.760 --> 00:23:29.360
I'll nag so he buys the necklace for your birthday.

208
00:23:29.520 --> 00:23:33.640
Wouldn't you postpone the rocket?

209
00:23:33.800 --> 00:23:39.680
- Did it stay nice?
 - It was hard to see.
 - Were you satisfied?

210
00:23:39.840 --> 00:23:44.640
Well ... a little buttocks it felt.

211
00:23:44.800 --> 00:23:49.240
It went way too low ...

212
00:23:49.400 --> 00:23:54.760
-Happy New!
 - Where was anyone injured?

213
00:23:54.920 --> 00:23:59.040
No, everyone got out.

214
00:23:59.200 --> 00:24:04.840
- Majesty took a round in their kitchen.
 - I had to extinguish.

215
00:24:05.000 --> 00:24:08.960
But the smoke remains ...

216
00:24:09.120 --> 00:24:14.960
- Nice, we got to celebrate anyway!
 -Come in!

217
00:24:15.120 --> 00:24:22.600
Here are our friends from Uddevalla.
 - Here is Gustav, Lena, Max and Lina.

218
00:24:24.440 --> 00:24:29.400
Funny that you came.
 Remove the champagne.

219
00:24:29.560 --> 00:24:36.000
If there is too little bubbles then there is a soft drink machine.

220
00:24:37.000 --> 00:24:40.440
Happy New Year!

221
00:24:41.600 --> 00:24:47.440
Maybe we should promise one and the other for the next New Year.

222
00:24:47.600 --> 00:24:54.680
- No fireworks!
 - And no ribs for breakfast.

223
00:24:54.840 --> 00:25:03.080
- and lobster instead of shrimp!
 - And we celebrate the twelve in the square.

224
00:25:03.240 --> 00:25:09.600
Great idea!
 We can invite them home, and we are celebrating here.

225
00:25:09.760 --> 00:25:15.880
- bowl for a new year!
 - Hope it will be as good as last.

226
00:25:16.040 --> 00:25:19.840
Try to think positively!

227
00:25:22.720 --> 00:25:26.360
HAPPY NEW YEAR!

228
