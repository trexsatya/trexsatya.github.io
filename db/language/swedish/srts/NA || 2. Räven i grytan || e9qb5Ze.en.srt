1
00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:16.720
It is Tamejfan died here.
 Not an animal left.

2
00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:20.800
Check out, there will be someone.

3
00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:29.920
It's Elin.

4
00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:34.160
Is she mad that you pretended to be a medium?

5
00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:40.080
Yes maybe.
 It's best that I declare myself.

6
00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:48.120
-Hi Elin.
 - Hi, Leif!

7
00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:53.280
Or the millionaire, the bear hunter, the medium ... what are you called today?

8
00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:58.560
Call me Leif or Leffe.
 It does not matter.

9
00:00:58.720 --> 00:01:03.560
I want to apologize for yesterday.
 It got a little crazy.

10
00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:08.320
Do you mean when you tried to revive my grandmother?

11
00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:13.880
- It was a little crazy.
 -Yes.
 I'm not a medium for real.

12
00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:19.320
- This is my little brother Billy.
 -I understood it.

13
00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:25.360
Well, Leif's little brother!
 Or the "demon", maybe?

14
00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:31.320
Anyway ... Are you looking to come over for dinner tonight?

15
00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:37.000
- So we pull a line over yesterday.
 –Eh ...

16
00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:44.480
Yes ... yes, absolutely.
 It can be ... exciting.

17
00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:50.240
How fun.
 You are not a vegetarian like all Stockholmers?

18
00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:56.080
No, I eat everything.
 Bird, fish, beef, game ...

19
00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:59.720
It is best I record.

20
00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:07.000
- Bird, fish, beef ... - I am allergic to nuts only.

21
00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:14.160
Good then I know!
 Then you can come and have s ... come at six o'clock.

22
00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:18.480
Fun!
 I jog on.
 Have it!

23
00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:27.520
-How did it go?
 - You have got a little date.

24
00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:34.280
-Date?
 What about me?
 - You may be on a small corner.

25
00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:39.800
We pull, it is completely dead.
 I have to go shopping.

26
00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:47.360
- It will be SEK 819.
 -Yes...

27
00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:55.640
- Do you want to test again?
 - Fan, there may not be money.

28
00:02:55.800 --> 00:03:00.080
We bought that leaf blower for 4,500.

29
00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:03.360
Remove half then, Billy.

30
00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:09.800
After all, we forgot to transfer money from Russian million ... the account.

31
00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:16.200
And so I forgot my black American Express at home.

32
00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:21.560
Test now, Leif.

33
00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:26.560
It is still not allowed.

34
00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:32.520
Damn, remove the cookies, potatoes and drink and that shit.

35
00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:39.600
- It is well with the terminal.
 - I don't think that's the problem.

36
00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:45.360
- Do you want to keep these?
 -No.

37
00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:48.880
Not these either.

38
00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:52.160
Then we try again then.

39
00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:57.760
It still does not work.

40
00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:07.320
This was the icing on the cake.
 I don't even have meat for tacos.

41
00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:10.840
May well do something of the vegetable.

42
00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:14.640
What the hell was that?

43
00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:30.760
- But, we will ... - Yes, the law has no need.

44
00:04:30.920 --> 00:04:35.920
- But it's a fox!
 - Yes, but the date must not be destroyed.

45
00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:39.480
Pick it up.

46
00:04:44.920 --> 00:04:47.720
Come now, it's in a hurry.

47
00:05:05.720 --> 00:05:11.080
Hello!
 Oh, how nice you are.

48
00:05:11.240 --> 00:05:16.520
- Yes, okay ... Welcome in.
 -Thanks.
 It's rough!

49
00:05:16.680 --> 00:05:19.440
Oh ... Hello.

50
00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:29.480
- Yeah ... — was a saw.

51
00:05:29.640 --> 00:05:36.000
It's like the worst luxury.
 Thanks...

52
00:05:38.480 --> 00:05:43.800
- What a nice thing you have.
 -Yes thank you.

53
00:05:49.080 --> 00:05:54.000
- Where is Leif?
 -Eh ... - Leif?!

54
00:05:54.080 --> 00:05:59.840
- She's here now.
 -Here I am.

55
00:06:05.360 --> 00:06:07.680
Hello!

56
00:06:13.360 --> 00:06:16.120
Sorry.

57
00:06:17.360 --> 00:06:19.640
Well!

58
00:06:20.440 --> 00:06:23.320
Oh...

59
00:06:23.480 --> 00:06:28.240
- thank you, Kypar'n.
 - Kypar'n?

60
00:06:29.600 --> 00:06:34.800
- Don't you join in and check out?
 - No, it didn't.

61
00:06:34.960 --> 00:06:39.200
–Leif said he wanted to be himself ... - with the disk!

62
00:06:39.360 --> 00:06:44.880
I said I wanted to be myself with the counter.
 We divide the chores.

63
00:06:45.040 --> 00:06:50.360
I wash and he serves today.
 Then we only had two chairs ...

64
00:06:50.520 --> 00:06:55.640
- You aren't hungry?
 - Well, I'm not going to have anything.

65
00:06:55.800 --> 00:07:01.080
- So you can eat in peace.
 -No.

66
00:07:01.240 --> 00:07:04.680
Yes ... sorry.
 The food is on the entrance.

67
00:07:04.840 --> 00:07:09.880
And my gentleman may want something to drink from the beginning.

68
00:07:10.040 --> 00:07:14.480
- Or now?
 -Yes how nice!

69
00:07:14.640 --> 00:07:21.760
I could imagine Chateauneuf-du-Pape.
 Perhaps?

70
00:07:21.920 --> 00:07:24.400
Leif we have ...

71
00:07:24.560 --> 00:07:30.000
I think ... Chapnö tough dad is over.

72
00:07:30.160 --> 00:07:35.280
- We drank it last week.
 - Yes, it's over.

73
00:07:35.440 --> 00:07:42.080
What is good is water, root wine, or red wine, and white wine.

74
00:07:42.240 --> 00:07:49.040
- And tap water and beer, of course.
 -I was joking!
 Red wine gets shit.

75
00:07:49.200 --> 00:07:53.640
- Yeah ... - I take a beer, as usual.

76
00:07:53.800 --> 00:08:00.200
- Billy!
 Bring it too.
 -Thousand thanks.

77
00:08:01.720 --> 00:08:03.680
Well.

78
00:08:16.720 --> 00:08:19.720
Well ...

79
00:08:19.880 --> 00:08:25.600
- Fun that you wanted to come.
 - Yes, this you have ruled up well.

80
00:08:25.760 --> 00:08:32.360
It's always fun when it comes to a nice ... new people to the village.

81
00:08:32.520 --> 00:08:35.680
Then we want to invite a little.

82
00:08:44.280 --> 00:08:48.480
-Sorry.
 I'm a little tired.
 -Yes...

83
00:08:49.960 --> 00:08:54.960
So there, my vultures ... ladies and gentlemen.

84
00:08:55.120 --> 00:08:59.280
- The food comes just right.
 - Billy.

85
00:08:59.440 --> 00:09:02.360
-Sorry.
 -Thanks!

86
00:09:02.520 --> 00:09:06.160
Thanks then, Kypar'n.

87
00:09:06.320 --> 00:09:13.320
- bowl for Sörbäcken.
 - For Sörbäcken.
 And us ... everyone here.

88
00:09:21.040 --> 00:09:26.640
How does it feel to have moved here to Sörbäcken?

89
00:09:26.800 --> 00:09:33.760
I love Sörbäcken, so it's najs.
 I haven't been able to do that much.

90
00:09:33.920 --> 00:09:39.480
Or I took a run.
 It's very beautiful.

91
00:09:39.640 --> 00:09:46.280
- Do you train anything?
 - I am doing different stuff.

92
00:09:46.440 --> 00:09:51.960
- I have a black belt in martial arts.
 -Tough guy!

93
00:09:52.120 --> 00:09:58.000
- But for real.
 Do you workout?
 - Yes, I have a little ...

94
00:09:58.160 --> 00:10:01.960
... karate business in Slaughterbo'n.

95
00:10:02.120 --> 00:10:06.240
-Okay.
 - I haven't got it started yet.

96
00:10:06.400 --> 00:10:10.200
Right now I'm trying the most new blows at Billy.

97
00:10:10.360 --> 00:10:16.960
Well ... I went on Thai boxing.
 It was Askul.

98
00:10:17.120 --> 00:10:24.440
But I got tired of being completely blown in the face, so I quit.

99
00:10:24.600 --> 00:10:30.560
- I haven't been beaten yet.
 -How nice.

100
00:10:32.120 --> 00:10:37.320
Shit, what I'm hungry!
 You remembered that with the nuts?

101
00:10:37.480 --> 00:10:41.640
Billy!
 Do you remember that with the nuts?

102
00:10:41.800 --> 00:10:47.840
Sure damn!
 "Beef".
 - It is quiet!
 I remember!

103
00:10:58.800 --> 00:11:04.560
- What is on the menu?
 - It's some fox meat ...

104
00:11:04.720 --> 00:11:08.640
Someone ... beef mince ... Pleasant.

105
00:11:08.800 --> 00:11:15.120
He has free reins in the kitchen, so I don't really know.

106
00:11:17.120 --> 00:11:21.160
-OOOH ... –OOOH-Sch ...

107
00:11:21.320 --> 00:11:26.920
-OOOH-Sch ... thank you, Kypar'n.
 - It looks great!

108
00:11:27.080 --> 00:11:34.280
It's a small tacos with Billy's own touch on beef.

109
00:11:34.440 --> 00:11:38.880
Nämen, extra touch!
 In the same!
 What exciting, Billy.

110
00:11:39.040 --> 00:11:42.680
-Have a nice meal.
 -Thank you then.

111
00:11:42.840 --> 00:11:47.360
- Bon appetite!
 -Exciting!

112
00:11:47.520 --> 00:11:53.920
Billy's special!
 We'll see how it tastes.
 I chop in.

113
00:11:57.040 --> 00:11:59.080
Mm.

114
00:12:01.920 --> 00:12:08.080
- It was a little salty.
 - We like strong food, we.

115
00:12:08.240 --> 00:12:11.640
Very exotic flavors and such.

116
00:12:11.800 --> 00:12:19.200
You seem to be very close.
 None of you have a girl?
 Or guy?

117
00:12:19.360 --> 00:12:24.760
There have been a lot of women who tried to get me on a case.

118
00:12:24.920 --> 00:12:28.120
But I'm waiting for the right one.

119
00:12:30.360 --> 00:12:34.560
-The right one?
 - Yes, she should have ...

120
00:12:34.720 --> 00:12:38.920
A little red, long hair.
 Hit, kind of ...

121
00:12:39.080 --> 00:12:43.440
-Nuts!
 - Yes, and nice feet.

122
00:12:43.600 --> 00:12:48.640
–Wa?
 - What happens, Leif?

123
00:12:48.800 --> 00:12:54.840
- You didn't stop the food in the food?
 - It is clear I did.

124
00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:58.240
She is a nut allergist!

125
00:12:59.600 --> 00:13:05.960
What happens, Elin?
 Say something!
 - Stupid, you have given her nuts!

126
00:13:06.120 --> 00:13:10.160
We have to make holes in the larynx!
 Get a pen!

127
00:13:10.320 --> 00:13:13.280
I've seen it on Discovery!

128
00:13:13.440 --> 00:13:21.120
Calm down, you will be able to breathe soon.
 - Not a pencil!

129
00:13:21.280 --> 00:13:25.440
Calm down, Elin, take it easy!
 What are you saying?

130
00:13:25.600 --> 00:13:28.480
Amputate?
 - We have to amputate!

131
00:13:28.640 --> 00:13:34.960
—Ring an ambulance!
 -Ambulance?
 Damn!

132
00:13:35.120 --> 00:13:37.680
You have killed her, Leif!

133
00:13:37.840 --> 00:13:43.120
It is Öhmans from Sörbäcken.
 Someone has got a fucking allergy shock.

134
00:13:43.280 --> 00:13:46.680
It is Billy who got nuts Ina!

135
00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:52.840
She got an allergic shock, but normally breathes now.

136
00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:58.520
- But we keep her overnight.
 -Thanks so much.

137
00:13:59.800 --> 00:14:04.880
Hell!
 Here I was meeting the woman in my life.

138
00:14:05.040 --> 00:14:11.520
And then you poison her with nuts.
 A nut allergy!
 Good job, Billy!

139
00:14:16.240 --> 00:14:23.200
Don't say beef then.
 It is called cooking.
 Mixed messages...

140
00:14:23.360 --> 00:14:29.640
Pea iron, come now!
 Do not waste more brain cells.

141
00:14:30.880 --> 00:14:35.160
You disappeared like a wind tears fell from my cheek

142
00:14:35.320 --> 00:14:39.800
Left there was nothing except your ring

143
00:14:39.960 --> 00:14:45.960
Everything you left, was an emptiness so great and totally total

144
