1
00:00:01,880 --> 00:00:04,480
Should you learn glosses using Flashcards

2
00:00:04,480 --> 00:00:06,880
so would I like to tip you that you are writing

3
00:00:06,880 --> 00:00:08,240
one word on one side.

4
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:10,080
How to write the translation on the other side.

5
00:00:10,640 --> 00:00:14,360
It is common to use flashcards to learn gloss,

6
00:00:14,360 --> 00:00:18,480
But it also works to learn, for example, the periodic system,

7
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:21,840
historical events or really anything.

8
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:24,160
- But if you are going to learn about Greek gods,

9
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:26,160
So you can write the name of the god on one side,

10
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:28,280
and a description of the god on the other side.

11
00:00:28,280 --> 00:00:32,240
So you write a heading, person, year, rule

12
00:00:32,240 --> 00:00:34,920
Or concept on one side of the patch.

13
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:38,000
And on the back you write what you need to know.

14
00:00:38,560 --> 00:00:41,720
Such as “Artemis” on one side

15
00:00:41,720 --> 00:00:46,720
And that she was the goddess of the hunting, the wild animals and the moon on the other side.

16
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:49,760
Then test yourself if you know the answers.

17
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:53,400
And check if you answered correctly by looking at the back.

18
00:00:53,400 --> 00:00:56,160
- If you answer correctly, you put it in a 'can-high'

19
00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:59,720
If you answered wrong, put it in a "cannot-high"

20
00:00:59,720 --> 00:01:03,000
Then train on the patches that ended up in "Can't-Högen"

21
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:09,960
When all the patches end up in "Kan-Högen".
 Take a break and test yourself at a later date.

22
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:13,720
- the next time you are going to plug with flashcards

23
00:01:13,720 --> 00:01:17,000
Try starting with the back first, ie Facit!
