00:00:12,380 --> 00:00:15,180
Welcome to the Gothenburg City Library.

2
00:00:15,180 --> 00:00:18,400
Mirjam is my name and work as a program librarian

3
00:00:19,040 --> 00:00:22,520
and we have for some time made a series of reading armchairs

4
00:00:22,780 --> 00:00:28,920
that is actually an old program series from the 90s

5
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:31,320
There the actors at the City Theater of Gothenburg

6
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:35,300
come in after the Saturday rehearsals and

7
00:00:35,300 --> 00:00:39,260
told stories or read poems on different themes.

8
00:00:39,740 --> 00:00:44,280
We invited Gothenburg's freelance actors for this

9
00:00:44,540 --> 00:00:46,660
And we have been running for three semesters now.

10
00:00:47,960 --> 00:00:50,640
And today we have Timo Nieminen and

11
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:54,280
Annika Nordin here and the theme are prospects.

12
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:00,928
Yes right now we have to keep away from each other.

13
00:01:02,460 --> 00:01:05,860
For it is hard to hug you have to keep more than one

14
00:01:06,040 --> 00:01:08,040
arm's length.

15
00:01:09,640 --> 00:01:12,900
It is said that every time we hug someone hot

16
00:01:12,900 --> 00:01:16,300
So our lives are extended by a whole day.

17
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:19,980
At least it says Paulo Coelho.

18
00:01:20,900 --> 00:01:23,780
So we would not be able to write a book about all types

19
00:01:23,780 --> 00:01:26,100
of hugs that exist for it would never end.

20
00:01:28,220 --> 00:01:31,900
There are as many types of hugs as there are

21
00:01:32,140 --> 00:01:33,700
people,

22
00:01:33,700 --> 00:01:34,980
situations,

23
00:01:35,740 --> 00:01:36,720
Relationships.

24
00:01:38,540 --> 00:01:40,100
So here's a reading chair

25
00:01:40,360 --> 00:01:45,540
full of poetic, lyrical, crazy,

26
00:01:45,760 --> 00:01:47,420
Romantic hugs.

27
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:49,560
But

28
00:01:49,820 --> 00:01:51,640
at a safe distance,

29
00:01:51,700 --> 00:01:52,640
like this.

30
00:01:54,680 --> 00:01:56,220
Prospects yes ..

31
00:01:57,800 --> 00:02:00,880
In the synonym dictionary we find words like:

32
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:03,280
panoramic,

33
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:04,440
hope,

34
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:06,100
hopes,

35
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:07,440
Views.

36
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:09,540
And from views

37
00:02:10,040 --> 00:02:12,600
the associations can easily go to windows.

38
00:02:13,640 --> 00:02:18,240
Windows, it is a strong theme of many artists through the ages.

39
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:23,620
Charles Baudelaire highlighted in one of his prosepoem:

40
00:02:24,896 --> 00:02:27,200
There is nothing deeper,

41
00:02:28,224 --> 00:02:30,016
Secret

42
00:02:30,272 --> 00:02:31,552
richer, richer,

43
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:34,660
dumb and more dazzling

44
00:02:35,640 --> 00:02:38,720
than a window illuminated by a light flame.

45
00:02:40,260 --> 00:02:44,100
What to look like in the sun is always less interesting

46
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:46,140
than the one that adds

47
00:02:46,580 --> 00:02:48,040
Behind a window pane.

48
00:02:49,480 --> 00:02:51,020
In this black hole

49
00:02:51,160 --> 00:02:52,280
living life

50
00:02:53,312 --> 00:02:54,080
Dreaming

51
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:55,600
Suffering.

52
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:04,320
From Baudelaire to Saarikoski, Pentti Saarikoski.

53
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:09,940
One dark gray morning I go to buy wine.

54
00:03:11,240 --> 00:03:15,080
The only one in the small bus and in the big one, out of three.

55
00:03:16,100 --> 00:03:19,180
Until a day when the little one is no longer needed

56
00:03:20,448 --> 00:03:24,800
It replaces the big one and we, we have become a winery

57
00:03:25,312 --> 00:03:30,944
And the great bus drivers drive the small and the small bus drivers chop our firewood.

58
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:37,020
Desolate to be the only bus's only

59
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:41,880
and embarrassing that in the big product one of three looking down at the knee

60
00:03:42,300 --> 00:03:45,020
A dark gray morning in February.

61
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:49,640
New thoughts are not needed for a long time

62
00:03:51,160 --> 00:03:55,380
On the high bridge I doubt its strength

63
00:03:55,440 --> 00:03:57,820
The fairway is dredged for larger boats

64
00:03:57,820 --> 00:03:58,320
null

65
00:03:59,880 --> 00:04:03,960
The smoke of factories over the city is the city of spirit

66
00:04:03,960 --> 00:04:06,020
that speaks without opening the mouth

67
00:04:06,580 --> 00:04:08,580
for in its mouth

68
00:04:09,344 --> 00:04:10,880
there are bad teeth

69
00:04:11,392 --> 00:04:12,672
bad

70
00:04:12,928 --> 00:04:13,696
teeth

71
00:04:14,976 --> 00:04:21,119
Supermarket is low house planned after human dimensions

72
00:04:21,631 --> 00:04:24,191
Also the short hand must be able to reach

73
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:29,820
In the bank, the bank director, today in the shirt sleeves

74
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:32,640
Everything killed in a moment

75
00:04:34,180 --> 00:04:37,880
I take my pirkka from his desk edge and sticks

76
00:04:37,960 --> 00:04:40,320
Here, here I want to leave my name

77
00:04:40,831 --> 00:04:43,941
But it is not possible, you forgot this,

78
00:04:43,941 --> 00:04:46,975
The name must be worn on the pocket every minute

79
00:04:47,231 --> 00:04:47,999
null

80
00:04:48,255 --> 00:04:50,047
And behind the boiler

81
00:04:51,080 --> 00:04:53,640
And one looks at me as a human being

82
00:04:53,640 --> 00:04:56,200
that is looking for excesses

83
00:04:58,500 --> 00:05:01,460
In the market I buy coffee and butter

84
00:05:01,740 --> 00:05:03,620
on the system wine

85
00:05:05,151 --> 00:05:09,247
In the cafe I sit and look at the high villas opposite

86
00:05:09,759 --> 00:05:12,319
where there lives people who are happy,

87
00:05:12,831 --> 00:05:13,599
in its way

88
00:05:14,879 --> 00:05:20,511
Other people who turned the wind so that the spirit of the city

89
00:05:20,767 --> 00:05:22,303
not breathe against them

90
00:05:24,863 --> 00:05:26,911
Sunny mornings and

91
00:05:27,167 --> 00:05:30,751
the sailboat's mood in the strait

92
00:05:31,260 --> 00:05:31,760
null

93
00:05:31,760 --> 00:05:36,560
a sober grogg with summer evening on the other side

94
00:05:37,020 --> 00:05:38,440
promises made them

95
00:05:38,687 --> 00:05:39,199
null

96
00:05:41,760 --> 00:05:43,200
New thoughts are not needed for a long time

97
00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:47,640
I sit quietly

98
00:05:47,900 --> 00:05:52,680
with the coffee and butter and wine in the box on the journey home

99
00:05:52,860 --> 00:05:55,920
in the big bus, one of the three

100
00:05:56,320 --> 00:05:56,820
null

101
00:05:57,380 --> 00:05:59,460
and in the small, the only one

102
00:06:01,480 --> 00:06:03,020
Then the driver runs

103
00:06:03,780 --> 00:06:04,300
alone.

104
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:11,640
From the balcony

105
00:06:12,740 --> 00:06:15,560
is quite clearly visible a overgrown pond

106
00:06:17,087 --> 00:06:18,623
The flute has toasted

107
00:06:19,391 --> 00:06:20,671
The turkey is dead

108
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:25,520
Ringing laundry house has rotted in the valley

109
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:26,100
null

110
00:06:26,100 --> 00:06:28,600
The carps are aged there

111
00:06:30,399 --> 00:06:32,703
The former connection with the sea has ceased

112
00:06:32,959 --> 00:06:33,471
null

113
00:06:34,751 --> 00:06:36,287
The sign is read

114
00:06:36,799 --> 00:06:38,847
Everything is forbidden

115
00:06:39,359 --> 00:06:41,407
The pond is turned off

116
00:06:43,455 --> 00:06:46,527
Shameful water lilies do their best

117
00:06:48,063 --> 00:06:48,831
submit

118
00:06:49,087 --> 00:06:50,111
melancholy

119
00:06:50,623 --> 00:06:51,135
And dream

120
00:06:51,903 --> 00:06:52,927
in defense

121
00:06:54,719 --> 00:06:55,743
Harry Martinson

122
00:07:05,480 --> 00:07:09,060
Suddenly the whole pamped lay for my soul

123
00:07:09,820 --> 00:07:14,520
with raising horizons, roaming horns

124
00:07:14,520 --> 00:07:17,680
horses, sheep and fleeing ostriches and gazelles

125
00:07:18,280 --> 00:07:18,780
And butterflies

126
00:07:20,063 --> 00:07:21,599
In millions.

127
00:07:21,855 --> 00:07:26,719
Gauchon rolling his horse over winding rivers

128
00:07:27,231 --> 00:07:30,815
damp flowering virgin soil

129
00:07:32,095 --> 00:07:35,935
brown moors along glittering ocean

130
00:07:37,020 --> 00:07:38,040
Vidalita

Taube

164
00:11:51,060 --> 00:11:53,400
Took us out into the world many times.

165
00:11:53,980 --> 00:11:58,880
Out in the world there was also a poet called Emelie Dickinson

166
00:11:58,940 --> 00:12:01,100
in the 1800s

167
00:12:01,400 --> 00:12:06,000
lived and worked in the United States but was first discovered during the 20th century

168
00:12:06,783 --> 00:12:07,807
She paid tribute to everyday life

169
00:12:09,340 --> 00:12:10,360
And the art

170
00:12:12,680 --> 00:12:15,780
Everyday life wakes and surrounds us

171
00:12:16,020 --> 00:12:18,280
is a drama that lives

172
00:12:19,320 --> 00:12:23,160
Other tragedy goes down when performed

173
00:12:23,679 --> 00:12:24,447
this one

174
00:12:24,959 --> 00:12:28,031
is played best when the audience has gone home

175
00:12:28,287 --> 00:12:30,079
and the lodges have been closed

176
00:12:31,359 --> 00:12:32,383
Hamlet

177
00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:35,967
Was Hamlet to himself if Shakespeare never wrote

178
00:12:37,247 --> 00:12:41,020
If Romeo never for his Julia suffered

179
00:12:41,020 --> 00:12:41,520
null

180
00:12:41,520 --> 00:12:43,920

null

182
00:12:44,540 --> 00:12:46,460
In the theater no one closed

183
00:12:47,487 --> 00:12:48,767
Human heart

184
00:12:53,375 --> 00:12:55,423
And as a tribute to

185
00:12:55,679 --> 00:12:57,983
Books and literature she writes

186
00:12:59,263 --> 00:13:04,127
No ship can, like the book, bring far out from land

187
00:13:05,160 --> 00:13:09,260
and no runner like the poem run freely without tape

188
00:13:10,280 --> 00:13:14,120
It is the mediumless trip to Cape Farewell

189
00:13:15,400 --> 00:13:15,900
So simple

190
00:13:16,340 --> 00:13:21,020
is the vessel that carries a person's soul
