1
00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:04,280
Now we are going to the first block of the day.

2
00:00:04,440 --> 00:00:09,320
Where is the limit for what to do and express?

3
00:00:09,480 --> 00:00:14,480
It is a discussion in the borderland between aesthetics, politics and human rights -

4
00:00:14,640 --> 00:00:19,000
- But also power, which Anna touched so wisely in the introduction.

5
00:00:19,160 --> 00:00:22,600
It has never been hotter than right now, it feels like.

6
00:00:22,760 --> 00:00:28,600
We now have the opportunity to take the discussion in depth and it is fun that so many are here.

7
00:00:28,760 --> 00:00:32,160
We are extra happy to have Kerstin Brunnberg here -

8
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:37,480
- To give us initial fuel for the discussion in today's first "keynote".

9
00:00:45,040 --> 00:00:49,520
Thanks!
 And thank you for emphasizing the importance of collaboration in your invitation.

10
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:53,960
You could only have said: "Yes, we cooperate well, then."

11
00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:58,440
But the question, of course, arises with whom, who, how and why.

12
00:00:58,600 --> 00:01:01,800
I'll try to give some clues.

13
00:01:01,960 --> 00:01:06,760
The other day I was at Vasavarvet with two six -year -olds.

14
00:01:06,920 --> 00:01:12,360
It was a successful visit with a lot to see and talk about.

15
00:01:12,520 --> 00:01:17,960
A surprising question to me was, "Did you know Gustav Vasa?"

16
00:01:20,360 --> 00:01:25,280
Okay, I look old, but not so old well?

17
00:01:25,440 --> 00:01:30,520
But for the six -year -old, moving between the ship Vaasa, his virtual worlds -

18
00:01:30,680 --> 00:01:34,040
-Radioapan in its iPad, between their books -

19
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:39,760
- Or between "Fejstajma" with his father who works in the United States sometimes, the issue was no wonder.

20
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:43,920
He lives in the global contemporary, but seeks the context -

21
00:01:44,080 --> 00:01:47,320
- And we all probably do that a little.

22
00:01:47,480 --> 00:01:53,360
Time, space and contexts are relative concepts.
 Today they are more relative than ever -

23
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:58,280
–In the time count I usually divide into bg and ag-

24
00:01:58,440 --> 00:02:01,440
- Ever "Before and After Google".

25
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:05,320
But above all, we live in unpredictability now -

26
00:02:05,480 --> 00:02:11,680
- There are some things snail in small, imperceptible steps and other things go very fast.

27
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:17,640
The slow is perhaps more important to pay attention than the fast.

28
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:22,240
Clearly, a number of major events exist to point to -

29
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:27,280
- As I mean has changed our everyday lives more than we might think -

30
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:30,000
- And given rise to some things.

31
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:34,600
The 2008 financial crisis, which led to liberalization -

32
00:02:34,760 --> 00:02:39,200
–And Riksbank that took the place in front of politics by printing money.

33
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:42,160
Politics stood quite empty.

34
00:02:42,320 --> 00:02:45,600
No one could point out a long -term plan for a new era -

35
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:50,520
- It is less secure that the money was used for real investments.

36
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:55,520
They actually went to short -term consumption -

37
00:02:55,680 --> 00:03:00,960
–And to people who did not engage in research, climate -

38
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:04,640
—The art, education or acquired new skills -

39
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:07,800
- Out more to consume.

40
00:03:07,960 --> 00:03:12,960
In this context, the lobbyists were more fast -paced than politics.

41
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:18,080
The financial crisis, globalization, new technology are all roles in a drama -

42
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:22,280
- Which is real and is neither at HBO nor at the cinema.

43
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:27,800
These forces together have doubtfully created an economic inequality -

44
00:03:27,960 --> 00:03:33,200
–A which creates even greater conditions for those who see how digitization can be used -

45
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:37,280
- And who then uses it to pick the lowest hanging fruits.

46
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:41,120
It leads to a redistribution to some who can all -

47
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:46,200
—A — from Facebook to make money on digital solutions -

48
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:51,640
- which does not really lead to us all keeping up.

49
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:59,280
The banks do not have to employ cashiers and others get rid of the job.

50
00:03:59,440 --> 00:04:04,120
There are those who have to move from the place where they live -

51
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:08,880
- And those who have to come here because they flee from direct threats.

52
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:12,640
Therefore the migration is the solution for these people -

53
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:15,960
- And properly handled it will also be a solution for Sweden.

54
00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:19,440
But politics has a hard time responding to changes -

55
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:24,920
- For it works with democracy as a process or with consultants, and it takes some time.

56
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:31,440
These are more serious explanations for the fact that democracy in our time is questioned and weakened -

57
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:34,040
- Like its institutions.

58
00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:39,640
Populism and nationalism easily take place where politics backs.

59
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:45,920
Populism becomes the power of the person who has been powerless when the large industry moved -

60
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:51,560
–And then when even the replacement job, in the form of a call center, moved to Moldova -

61
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:55,760
- Or when the robots take over the mining.

62
00:04:55,920 --> 00:05:01,240
When Sweden went from an agricultural country to an industrial nation, many were needed.

63
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:08,160
Today, the change forces may create digitalisation and new technology very good -

64
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:13,880
- But also concerns and wonder about the major changes that have gone fast or slowly.

65
00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:17,640
It becomes the perfect soil and nutrition ate the forces -

66
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:24,720
–Do, undemocratic, racist, religious oppressive, violent and huge -

67
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:29,880
-And just waiting to come back and promise you that everything will be like before -

68
00:05:30,040 --> 00:05:33,520
- And is reminiscent of the need for nationalism.

69
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:36,640
The Nazi forces have not been away -

70
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:42,200
- I am in my simplicity thought they could never come back.

71
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:47,600
On the contrary, they have just expected, grown and take over where politics leaves a void.

72
00:05:47,760 --> 00:05:54,960
Holocaust deniers and open racism are two things I didn't think would come back.

73
00:05:55,120 --> 00:06:00,120
John Sifton, who is the head of Human Rights Watch in Asia, speaks om-

74
00:06:00,280 --> 00:06:04,640
- How the entire human rights thinking after the Second World War has weakened.

75
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:07,000
Democracy is under attack.

76
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:13,600
Journalist Per Wirtén writes in his excellent book about Europe -

77
00:06:13,760 --> 00:06:20,000
- The fear characterized the past, not our future, but it has changed.

78
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:25,320
Now we have reason to be afraid when we see the development in our neighboring areas -

79
00:06:25,480 --> 00:06:32,480
–As in Hungary and Poland where you make it easy for themselves and change the independence of the courts

80
00:06:32,640 --> 00:06:38,080
- Just by retiring the judges who do not judge as the power likes.

81
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:43,360
The transition from one to the other is creeping -

82
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:49,120
- And we have to watch out when the transformation takes place and when the lie becomes truth.

83
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:53,840
Why then talk about it when we talk about freedom of speech, art and culture?

84
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:58,360
Well, because the anti -democratic forces that now act in different ways -

85
00:06:58,520 --> 00:07:02,960
–And that pops up on streets, in organizations and political congregations -

86
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:06,360
–And who more than others understands to seem digitally ...

87
00:07:06,520 --> 00:07:13,560
There is one thing they see as their greatest resistance and as most important to fight -

88
00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:19,240
- And it is freedom of speech, which is a prerequisite for independent media and art.

89
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:24,360
For they cannot control people's experience of art-

90
00:07:24,520 --> 00:07:31,680
- And has realized that its effect of influence is so great and therefore they want to censor in different ways.

91
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:37,120
Now I am not talking about the performance "Krilon" at the Stadsteatern in Stockholm -

92
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:40,880
–To on reality in Sweden and in Europe.

93
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:46,800
PEN, ICORN AND FREEMUSE are organizations that have spoken about - in their reports

94
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:52,400
- How independent art scares these anti -democratic forces in Sweden and the world.

95
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:58,680
The close to 30 sanctuary artists found here in Sweden right now -

96
00:07:58,840 --> 00:08:04,400
–And that has been able to stay here after the two years that the scholarship means -

97
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:11,160
-Is an overly unused resource to understand and tell about what is an irreplaceable asset -

98
00:08:11,320 --> 00:08:15,200
- Fair art and how the fragile art lives -

99
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:20,080
- And what a professional ban for artistic work means.

100
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:26,040
Those organizations have also warned for a long time, just like the media and artists -

101
00:08:26,200 --> 00:08:28,880
- If what really happens.

102
00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:35,480
Together with the climate experts, such as Rachel Carson and his Palmstierna -

103
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:38,320
- As a long time spoke about the climate ...

104
00:08:38,480 --> 00:08:44,880
All those who have pointed to what's happening have received as much attention from us -

105
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:50,040
- As the cabin crew talks about the security before the flight.

106
00:08:51,160 --> 00:08:55,880
Therefore, the attacks on democracy are now a moss fire in our country -

107
00:08:56,040 --> 00:08:59,120
- But an open fire in many other countries.

108
00:08:59,280 --> 00:09:05,520
And that is why the role of art has never been as challenged and important to defend as now.

109
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:08,560
"It was fun to hear," you think.

110
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:15,000
But many people joined when many refugees came to Sweden -

111
00:09:15,160 --> 00:09:17,760
- And worked together and made a difference.

112
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:22,720
Very many joined together when the fires raged this summer.

113
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:27,160
In the same way, we must arrange joint forces -

114
00:09:27,320 --> 00:09:32,080
- To take back the political void that Per Wirtén and Daniel Poohl speak om-

115
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:36,560
- In their analyzes of the time we live in now.

116
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:41,480
Our time requires more than other collaboration and responsibility for each other.

117
00:09:41,640 --> 00:09:47,000
No question can be solved today without cooperation and conversation.

118
00:09:47,160 --> 00:09:51,440
I will not list all the abuse that we are told every day -

119
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:57,440
–But urges you to follow Pen, Freemuse and Reporters Without Borders -

120
00:09:57,600 --> 00:10:03,800
-a couple of times a week.
 You can support them just as you support Amnesty.

121
00:10:03,960 --> 00:10:09,600
These organizations are not special interests, but everyone's representatives.

122
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:14,960
What should be done?
 Yes, what should you and I do as individuals?

123
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:21,840
First, we will pay for the art, with both common and own resources.

124
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:25,480
Secondly, we should respect copyright.

125
00:10:25,640 --> 00:10:30,360
As little as we with lowered taxes can afford to obtain your own ambulance -

126
00:10:30,520 --> 00:10:35,360
–Or can build your own art museum or opera house -

127
00:10:35,520 --> 00:10:40,560
- So we will together finance the conditions for the art.

128
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:45,360
The public has a responsibility for everyone to have access to art throughout the country -

129
00:10:45,520 --> 00:10:49,040
–And therefore support systems must be created that are reasonable -

130
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:53,200
- For artists to be artists.

131
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:58,320
Harry Schein writes in his book "Can we afford culture?"
 From 1962 ...

132
00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:02,800
I actually have to quote him.

133
00:11:02,960 --> 00:11:06,120
Now let's see ... I'm browsing.

134
00:11:07,520 --> 00:11:11,480
"Requirements for increased community support to culture are usually rejected" -

135
00:11:11,640 --> 00:11:14,920
- "With references to the state financial situation."

136
00:11:15,080 --> 00:11:19,320
"The uninvited artist in economic things then leaves the office" -

137
00:11:19,480 --> 00:11:25,040
- "with a vague feeling that a higher income for his or her part" -

138
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:30,800
- "would cause a state bank route, mass unemployment and inflation."

139
00:11:30,960 --> 00:11:35,640
"He or she does not know that the state financial argument is stated" -

140
00:11:35,800 --> 00:11:41,360
- "To justify all rejections on grant requirements that are not directly silly."

141
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:46,360
Some of the suggestions that are on the next government's table -

142
00:11:46,520 --> 00:11:52,560
- From the artist's political investigation is both renewal, understandable and handy.

143
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:56,680
They point to the need to reduce detail regulation -

144
00:11:56,840 --> 00:12:00,440
–But also on the fact that the state must take responsibility -

145
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:05,880
- Because the artists' conditions are also generally improved.

146
00:12:06,040 --> 00:12:08,760
The social insurance system is an example.

147
00:12:08,920 --> 00:12:13,800
The main focus should be that responsible decision -making bodies design criteria -

148
00:12:13,960 --> 00:12:18,400
- For which artists should be eligible to receive artist policy support.

149
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:22,440
The authorities themselves should, not the government.

150
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:26,040
Cultural policy is probably the most difficult policy area.

151
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:30,920
It is easy to measure that the speed trains go faster -

152
00:12:31,080 --> 00:12:36,600
- But much more difficult to measure what art and culture really do for use.

153
00:12:36,760 --> 00:12:41,640
I can only say that cultural policy is really simple.

154
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:49,240
Money will be in and lots of money to be distributed so that the independence of art is maintained.

155
00:12:49,400 --> 00:12:53,720
But it is so vulnerable when it gets into the hands of those who want something else -

156
00:12:53,880 --> 00:12:58,600
–And easy for new genres and forms of art to be covered either -

157
00:12:58,760 --> 00:13:01,920
- When it is an overly detailed support system.

158
00:13:02,080 --> 00:13:06,680
That's why Schein says, which I quote for the second time:

159
00:13:06,840 --> 00:13:10,960
"Rather too many bad artists than too few good."

160
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:17,280
But without detracting an important discussion on political control of culture and art-

161
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:22,600
- It is still at present perhaps as a western fan -

162
00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:27,480
- compared to when in Harry Schein's book also read his description -

163
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:31,160
–As how the then Ministry of Commerce opposed the proposal -

164
00:13:31,320 --> 00:13:36,320
- If the stage artists' salaries would be listed as everyone else was paid.

165
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:42,080
The Ministry said: "Wouldn't it be better if they played plays that were more crowded?"

166
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:45,040
"Then they would get more revenue."

167
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:48,480
It might as well have been that a department had said -

168
00:13:48,640 --> 00:13:54,560
- That Swedish Radio does not need so many channels, especially not P3.

169
00:13:54,720 --> 00:14:00,840
Or: would it not be good to put down the symphony orchestra in Gävle -

170
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,800
- Or the bytheater in Kalmar?

171
00:14:03,960 --> 00:14:10,160
These are some of the Swedish Democrats designated, threatened candidates - the closure -threatened candidates -

172
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:15,280
- As Anders Rydell describes in his excellent article in Svenska Dagbladet.

173
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:19,440
Now is the third and last time I quote Harry Schein.

174
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:23,600
It is a joy to read his uncompromising demands on what sought -sought -

175
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:28,280
- In the Cultural Council's working groups or the Artists' Committee's assessments.

176
00:14:28,440 --> 00:14:35,440
Assessments and distribution of support must therefore be made on the basis of professional quality criteria.

177
00:14:36,440 --> 00:14:42,520
The cultural policy work must be conducted according to strictly artistic quality principles.

178
00:14:42,680 --> 00:14:46,160
"Therefore, members of support distribution institutions should be appointed" -

179
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:50,200
- "From the artistic disciplines' own main expertise" -

180
00:14:50,360 --> 00:14:55,400
- "And a statutory compulsory circulation is carried out to prevent academic."

181
00:14:55,560 --> 00:15:01,680
"But also for some years after year to decide the public quality valuation."

182
00:15:01,840 --> 00:15:07,480
It can be changed.
 Schein calls this undemocratic for someone who pays taxes.

183
00:15:07,640 --> 00:15:10,880
Sure, but each one has the right to their own taste.

184
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:16,400
"But assessments of support requires as much special and specialized knowledge" -

185
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:22,680
- "Like, for example, science. Therefore, the quality requirement is not undemocratic."

186
00:15:22,840 --> 00:15:26,840
He predicts significant political difficulties to get through this -

187
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:32,400
- But the reasons for are so big.
 He also describes how the professional art -

188
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:37,080
—As with its ability to go before contemporary contemporary -

189
00:15:37,240 --> 00:15:41,240
–An spread like rings on the water -

190
00:15:41,400 --> 00:15:45,640
–And develops the art that no one could imagine.

191
00:15:45,800 --> 00:15:52,080
Other that needs to be done: lower the digital VAT.
 Don't talk about it, but do it.

192
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:57,120
One can also wish for a more sincere recognition of the value of copyright -

193
00:15:57,280 --> 00:16:01,640
–Os players like Spotify, Google, Facebook and Amazon -

194
00:16:01,800 --> 00:16:07,160
- And that the artists' compensation should not be seen as a gate of goodwill.

195
00:16:07,320 --> 00:16:10,440
Support and develop the system of sanctuary artists -

196
00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:17,720
- which are not individuals, but principles for showing ...

197
00:16:19,280 --> 00:16:25,440
... to show what freedom of speech is really worth and how fragile it is.

198
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:30,880
The Migration Board must be getting better at showing artists -

199
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:35,080
–Ast come from different countries where visas are required to come here -

200
00:16:35,240 --> 00:16:38,160
- And not be afraid that they will stay.

201
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:42,200
The school must show early on what art and creativity really are.

202
00:16:42,360 --> 00:16:45,680
That it is as important as math and physics.

203
00:16:45,840 --> 00:16:51,680
The interesting thing then is that you speak so much about the fact that cooperation is growing in importance.

204
00:16:51,840 --> 00:16:57,000
The cooperation which means that in a certain situation also release the control, delegate responsibility -

205
00:16:57,160 --> 00:17:02,320
–Emen Detail management and accepting a process of changing conditions -

206
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:06,280
- Where the foundation is something as banal and basic as trust.

207
00:17:06,440 --> 00:17:11,480
How, then, should we deal with the gap in between - control versus confidence?

208
00:17:11,640 --> 00:17:15,880
It's a question for this day.
 But remember one thing:

209
00:17:16,040 --> 00:17:21,240
Art has no task more than being art.

210
00:17:23,080 --> 00:17:27,200
For the art, as Benny Fredriksson has said, the inexplicable defenders -

211
00:17:27,360 --> 00:17:33,760
- In a time that wants to explain everything and forget what cannot be explained.
 Thanks so much.

212
00:17:50,800 --> 00:17:54,520
Thanks for a great deal of fuel for the discussion.

213
00:17:54,680 --> 00:17:58,120
I am now inviting the first panel of the day.

214
00:17:58,280 --> 00:18:01,840
Lars Anders Johansson from Timbro, well.

215
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:06,000
We all applaud together when they are invited.

216
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:11,080
Ulrica Källén, operations manager at Klys and a member of the Swedish UNESCOR Council.

217
00:18:11,240 --> 00:18:14,720
And Carolina Frände who is a director.

218
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:17,880
We welcome them with an applause.

219
00:18:25,480 --> 00:18:30,480
Now Kerstin has deservedly spoken warmly to freedom -

220
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:34,600
- And at the same time we have the word limit in our themes.

221
00:18:34,760 --> 00:18:41,120
I start by asking the question how the panel looks at that perspective.

222
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:45,200
Is there a far limit or no limit at all?

223
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:48,360
Here you go.
 Who wants to jump in there?

224
00:18:48,520 --> 00:18:52,040
- Should I start from the artist perspective?
 -Yes please.

225
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:56,800
Freedom of speech for the artistic professionals -

226
00:18:56,960 --> 00:19:00,960
- Should be as wide as possible, but there are boundaries.

227
00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:05,040
We have legislation and a society.

228
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:09,480
Art is in a social context that naturally affects.

229
00:19:09,640 --> 00:19:14,520
It is impossible to say where the limit goes.

230
00:19:14,680 --> 00:19:20,120
It varies from time to time and depending on the situation.

231
00:19:21,320 --> 00:19:24,360
So I can't answer that question.

232
00:19:24,520 --> 00:19:28,440
But the development we see is alarming.

233
00:19:28,600 --> 00:19:33,480
From Klys and my work I can say -

234
00:19:33,640 --> 00:19:38,760
–Ad every time the freedom of speech is limited we react -

235
00:19:38,920 --> 00:19:44,440
- And trying to oppose us that development in referral opinions and other things.

236
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:47,600
Do you then think of the political governance -

237
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:52,640
- Or on the development of the expressions that exist in the public space today?

238
00:19:52,800 --> 00:19:57,160
I think of the political governance -

239
00:19:57,320 --> 00:20:02,120
- But also on what Kerstin was in, the conditions of the cultural creator.

240
00:20:02,280 --> 00:20:06,240
That the conditions look like this today-

241
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:11,840
—To you as an artist do not always have the opportunity to dare to express you -

242
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:16,640
- Dare to experiment and provoke in the way society needs.

243
00:20:16,800 --> 00:20:21,240
It is a limitation that we are very concerned about.

244
00:20:21,400 --> 00:20:23,800
Thanks.
 - You are welcome.

245
00:20:23,960 --> 00:20:28,480
Freedom of speech and political governance often collapse.

246
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:33,440
As Ulrica says, self -censorship is an almost equal threat -

247
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:37,320
- As a kind of political restriction on freedom of expression.

248
00:20:37,480 --> 00:20:40,400
I have seen ROP - for a number of years

249
00:20:40,560 --> 00:20:45,560
- On the fact that one should restrict the possibilities of commenting in the public space.

250
00:20:45,720 --> 00:20:52,720
On Dagens Nyheter's cultural site, we have been able to read calls for private companies -

251
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:57,720
- To start limiting the opinions expressed on Facebook and so on.

252
00:20:57,880 --> 00:21:01,800
The sitting government had a meeting with Youtube -

253
00:21:01,960 --> 00:21:06,680
- About how to limit access to dissatisfied views.

254
00:21:06,840 --> 00:21:11,520
On Youtube it is the same group ...

255
00:21:11,680 --> 00:21:15,080
This has a number of strange consequences.

256
00:21:15,240 --> 00:21:22,640
On Facebook, people can come together against political opponents with mass notifications -

257
00:21:22,800 --> 00:21:30,000
- And then Facebook removes the posts or even closes by people.

258
00:21:30,160 --> 00:21:35,840
It becomes a kind of bully mentality where you silence those you disagree.

259
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:41,120
On Youtube we have seen how counterproductive this will be.

260
00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:46,480
You may read about the Swedish Democrats' film about the Social Democrats -

261
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:51,240
- Then was removed from Youtube?
 It had several consequences.

262
00:21:51,400 --> 00:21:57,840
On the one hand, the Swedish Democrats were able to put on their martyrki web that they like to wear.

263
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:01,400
In this individual case, it was also well deserved.

264
00:22:01,560 --> 00:22:08,080
On the one hand, the debate was not about whether the image they conveyed in their film was true -

265
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:12,040
- Out whether they had been silenced.

266
00:22:12,200 --> 00:22:16,560
So even opponents of the Sweden Democrats shot themselves in the foot -

267
00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:19,960
- When their film was removed.

268
00:22:20,120 --> 00:22:26,480
There are many examples where one supposedly good purpose -

269
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:30,640
- Sying deviating opinions, and so it has exactly the opposite consequence.

270
00:22:30,800 --> 00:22:37,520
The Facebook algorithm's change in February this year when you were to make Facebook more enjoyable.

271
00:22:37,680 --> 00:22:43,560
Zuckerberg's purpose was that we would not get irrelevant things in our flows.

272
00:22:43,720 --> 00:22:50,520
But it has led to the consequence that the hate sites have increased their traffic -

273
00:22:50,680 --> 00:22:56,640
- At the expense of other sites, thus the exact opposite result for what they were sought.

274
00:22:56,800 --> 00:23:01,880
The platforms go through what democracy went through too long ago on limits.

275
00:23:02,040 --> 00:23:08,120
They are experimenting with it now but do not want to listen to anyone else, so that's a problem.

276
00:23:08,280 --> 00:23:11,120
Do you want to jump into the discussion?

277
00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:16,520
We who are engaged in the direct artistic activity often have a self -image -

278
00:23:16,680 --> 00:23:21,520
–This our institutions where the art is done in a way is unusual -

279
00:23:21,680 --> 00:23:25,640
- Of the freedom of speech and border problems.

280
00:23:25,800 --> 00:23:30,160
We can no longer take that for granted in any way.

281
00:23:30,320 --> 00:23:37,520
We must think about how we can professionalize the part of the institutions -

282
00:23:37,680 --> 00:23:42,960
– Or the parts of the art -practicing side -

283
00:23:43,120 --> 00:23:46,040
- Which receives the political assignments.

284
00:23:46,200 --> 00:23:51,720
We talk a lot about political governance, but often forget the intermediary.

285
00:23:51,880 --> 00:23:56,080
There is a political governance, and then hand over to some -

286
00:23:56,240 --> 00:23:59,880
- As either distributes the money or does the art.

287
00:24:00,040 --> 00:24:05,560
We also have a tendency to get stuck in the contradiction -

288
00:24:05,720 --> 00:24:10,160
- Between cultural bureaucracy, or art bureaucracy ...

289
00:24:10,320 --> 00:24:14,080
That is what the practicing world often calls the exercise of authority -

290
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:18,680
- And other types of interest organizations in cultural bureaucratic field.

291
00:24:18,840 --> 00:24:23,280
We fast in a contradiction between artistic practice and cultural bureaucracy -

292
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:25,920
- When we should go together.

293
00:24:26,080 --> 00:24:31,640
Kerstin talked about the fact that there is a void that the policy leaves there now.

294
00:24:31,800 --> 00:24:36,120
I also identify that void in the art.

295
00:24:36,280 --> 00:24:39,680
I am a primarily performing artist.

296
00:24:39,840 --> 00:24:44,880
Although I have been a manager for about fifteen years, I can see -

297
00:24:45,040 --> 00:24:50,160
- The movement that exists in politics is just as much in the art.

298
00:24:50,320 --> 00:24:57,800
When it becomes too combustible or too hot to enter into an ideological debate -

299
00:24:57,960 --> 00:25:03,000
- So we would rather renounce and talk about the arts -

300
00:25:03,160 --> 00:25:09,000
–Com by using the argument for the being of art that Kerstin brought up -

301
00:25:09,160 --> 00:25:13,680
- The art should be nothing but art.
 As if that were an argument-

302
00:25:13,840 --> 00:25:20,920
- To refrain from interfering with opinions about freedom of speech or artistic freedoms.

303
00:25:21,080 --> 00:25:26,920
It is extremely important to set boundaries, just as you started by saying.

304
00:25:27,080 --> 00:25:31,640
Borders are crucial for artistic freedom to prevail.

305
00:25:31,800 --> 00:25:39,240
Those limits should in some way formulate the principles, agreements -

306
00:25:39,400 --> 00:25:46,680
- And other things that many people in artistic practice often find boring.

307
00:25:46,840 --> 00:25:49,080
Policies and stuff.

308
00:25:49,240 --> 00:25:54,600
Because if we cannot defend human rights within the institutions -

309
00:25:54,760 --> 00:26:00,760
- And we can't really today, then we can't expect to be able to keep the art free.

310
00:26:01,920 --> 00:26:05,800
I led a media investigation recently -

311
00:26:05,960 --> 00:26:11,280
- Where we had with the democracy requirement and what you are in, and that is a combustible issue.

312
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:15,880
Those standing on the freedom of speech-fundamentalist side-

313
00:26:16,040 --> 00:26:20,400
- I think that this is an intervention and that the limit is too narrow.

314
00:26:20,560 --> 00:26:26,440
I want to say two things.
 One is that you have become aware of how fragile the system is.

315
00:26:26,600 --> 00:26:30,520
How easy it is to change for those who want to change it.

316
00:26:30,680 --> 00:26:36,560
But also what you are in with social media -

317
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:40,360
- As you can love on the one hand, but hate just as much.

318
00:26:40,520 --> 00:26:45,400
There are no democratic structures -

319
00:26:45,560 --> 00:26:51,040
- This means that we get to know what it is we are not told and who is stopped.

320
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:55,960
When Facebook is editor of what is written on Facebook -

321
00:26:56,120 --> 00:26:58,720
- I'll be dark scared.

322
00:26:58,880 --> 00:27:03,080
There, anything can come in and start controlling it.

323
00:27:03,240 --> 00:27:06,960
We see today as I do in my naivety -

324
00:27:07,120 --> 00:27:11,840
- Near did not think could occur.

325
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:15,920
The second, that Carolina takes up ...

326
00:27:16,080 --> 00:27:21,600
Who has said that in the production of art should not advise -

327
00:27:21,760 --> 00:27:24,920
—The common decency; human rights -

328
00:27:25,080 --> 00:27:29,720
- Jimination and respect?

329
00:27:29,880 --> 00:27:34,720
Then I have to say that what the art does, I shit in that.

330
00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:40,080
But in the production of art, in the collaboration ...

331
00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:44,520
Then all support systems have a tendency to become guiding -

332
00:27:44,680 --> 00:27:49,440
- Propping of self -censorship, and therefore you need to discuss them.

333
00:27:49,600 --> 00:27:54,960
If I am going to take on the fundamentalists that we have not represented in the panel -

334
00:27:55,120 --> 00:28:00,000
- So they would say that when we instrumentalize the art expressions in that way -

335
00:28:00,160 --> 00:28:05,360
–And says things that are okay at this time as it can be a danger -

336
00:28:05,520 --> 00:28:09,480
- As every time has its taboos.

337
00:28:09,640 --> 00:28:15,600
Now we have broken a taboo with "metoo" that you couldn't talk about five to ten years ago-

338
00:28:15,760 --> 00:28:19,680
- And could not express in any way.
 What do you say about it?

339
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:24,760
There has never been any legislation against talking about Metoo.

340
00:28:24,920 --> 00:28:28,720
It has been a norm simply -

341
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:33,800
–And that's what I think is interesting, in what you said Kerstin -

342
00:28:33,960 --> 00:28:40,680
- If we must be able to create reasonable production conditions and working conditions.

343
00:28:40,840 --> 00:28:44,720
It has nothing to do with what is then said in the art.

344
00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:47,360
Absolutely nothing.

345
00:28:47,520 --> 00:28:52,880
We are still living in a mythology of a little worse working conditions -

346
00:28:53,040 --> 00:28:57,520
- There is a little "ruff" climate, provides better art.

347
00:28:57,680 --> 00:29:04,120
I have worked for 20 years as a director and am a living proof that it is not true.

348
00:29:04,280 --> 00:29:08,840
Had it been, I would not have been in the profession.

349
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:13,920
If it had been a compulsion to have poor working conditions.

350
00:29:14,080 --> 00:29:21,480
I think that within the artistic we actually need to evaluate -

351
00:29:21,640 --> 00:29:25,720
- This is the structure and not the content.

352
00:29:25,880 --> 00:29:29,160
Thus, the structure for collaboration and so on.

353
00:29:29,320 --> 00:29:34,160
- We easily slide there between the different parts.
 - An important distinction.

354
00:29:34,320 --> 00:29:37,280
If one is a freedom of speech fundamentalist -

355
00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:41,360
—To one is aware that publicly controlled organizations -

356
00:29:41,520 --> 00:29:45,720
—Recodes the ideology that characterizes public operations -

357
00:29:45,880 --> 00:29:50,000
- Then I am happy to take that role.

358
00:29:50,160 --> 00:29:54,120
I think it's a pretty nice concept.

359
00:29:54,280 --> 00:30:00,640
Unsurprisingly, maybe I do not share Kerstin Brunnberg's view -

360
00:30:00,800 --> 00:30:04,080
–In the introductory lecture -

361
00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:10,080
–If that would mean an increase in artistic freedom -

362
00:30:10,240 --> 00:30:15,760
– That one shifts power from civil society and the private sector -

363
00:30:15,920 --> 00:30:18,640
- To public institutions.

364
00:30:18,800 --> 00:30:24,280
I rather believe that there is a danger there, due to public institutions -

365
00:30:24,440 --> 00:30:31,320
- All time will reproduce the values of political power that prevail at the moment.

366
00:30:31,480 --> 00:30:37,160
The only way to counteract this is institutional competition -

367
00:30:37,320 --> 00:30:42,640
- Over if we talk about private or publicly funded institutions.

368
00:30:42,800 --> 00:30:47,920
The more concentration of power in the cultural field, the less artistic freedom.

369
00:30:48,080 --> 00:30:50,920
Should we have two cultural councils then?

370
00:30:51,080 --> 00:30:56,640
- Yes, it would be good if there was one for cultural council.
 - Attach, then!

371
00:30:56,800 --> 00:31:00,880
Artistic freedom occurs in the space between the institutions.

372
00:31:01,040 --> 00:31:06,080
You can never order artistic freedom from a political point of view.

373
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:09,960
What you can do is not limit artistic freedom.

374
00:31:10,120 --> 00:31:14,520
Do you want a reply?
 You get it.

375
00:31:14,680 --> 00:31:19,040
We think it is good that there are several authorities -

376
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:23,360
–Or works with the field of cultural and artist policy-

377
00:31:23,520 --> 00:31:29,800
- Because we complement each other, have different knowledge and support different parts of the area.

378
00:31:33,240 --> 00:31:38,920
I just want to say that the state has a great responsibility, as well as regions and municipalities.

379
00:31:39,080 --> 00:31:42,360
But the private, you ...

380
00:31:42,520 --> 00:31:47,640
Private donors have a huge responsibility -

381
00:31:47,800 --> 00:31:53,640
- And probably a great interest in there being both parts.

382
00:31:53,800 --> 00:32:00,400
But there is so much of art that must actually be supported by our common resources.

383
00:32:00,560 --> 00:32:04,600
You have to point that.

384
00:32:04,760 --> 00:32:11,320
It's harder to go to the neighbor and say: Can't you spend your money on art?

385
00:32:11,480 --> 00:32:17,680
I have some respect for those who support art with their private resources.

386
00:32:18,680 --> 00:32:24,360
You said that tax cuts never led to increased cultural financing.

387
00:32:24,520 --> 00:32:27,960
It is not true because the shift in power took place -

388
00:32:28,120 --> 00:32:31,680
–Bae by the state expanding its commitments -

389
00:32:31,840 --> 00:32:35,760
- And that they undermined the opportunities for private financing.

390
00:32:35,920 --> 00:32:39,040
So it was a two -way process.

391
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:45,240
Then it is so that most of the cultural life is funded by all of us with private funds -

392
00:32:45,400 --> 00:32:49,840
- So all are cultural power to a greater or lesser extent.

393
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:54,360
But that is the problem with part of the public funding -

394
00:32:54,520 --> 00:32:57,360
-It the target conflict that always exists -

395
00:32:57,520 --> 00:33:01,920
- And that cannot be bridged with the principle of arm's length.

396
00:33:02,080 --> 00:33:05,240
Namely that our elected representatives -

397
00:33:05,400 --> 00:33:11,680
- Must be able to demand some form of detectable results -

398
00:33:11,840 --> 00:33:15,120
- From the operations that are financed.

399
00:33:15,280 --> 00:33:18,840
There, after all, there is a contradiction between the freedom of art -

400
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:24,680
- And the rather sad reality found in all politically controlled activities.

401
00:33:24,840 --> 00:33:28,360
That is exactly what is the problem with providing resources.

402
00:33:28,520 --> 00:33:32,760
So the state, the public, should support media and art.

403
00:33:32,920 --> 00:33:37,600
- That's the problem.
 - Now that debate is over.

404
00:33:37,760 --> 00:33:43,360
- But how do you make it less brittle?
 --Ulrica wants to jump in.

405
00:33:43,520 --> 00:33:47,240
From KLYS, we are for a variety of sources of financing.

406
00:33:47,400 --> 00:33:52,640
The private initiatives can work supplementary and promote artistic freedom -

407
00:33:52,800 --> 00:33:57,160
- But it is incredibly important that there are public institutions -

408
00:33:57,320 --> 00:34:00,840
- Which are strong and that we can invest more in.

409
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:07,080
The important thing in terms of them is the second line at arm's length-principle-

410
00:34:07,240 --> 00:34:12,480
–Stious that the artistic assessment is to be made by independent experts -

411
00:34:12,640 --> 00:34:18,400
- And preferably cultural creators, in reference groups such as at the Cultural Council and the Artists' Committee.

412
00:34:18,560 --> 00:34:23,920
That part of that principle is for guaranteeing the freedom of art -

413
00:34:24,080 --> 00:34:28,040
- And that officials should not interfere in the content.

414
00:34:28,200 --> 00:34:31,800
I want to say that in that.

415
00:34:31,960 --> 00:34:35,200
This is a bit of value with value.

416
00:34:35,360 --> 00:34:39,080
You were on it in your introduction, Kerstin.

417
00:34:39,240 --> 00:34:45,080
So when the recipient becomes a consumer and how we look at the value of art.

418
00:34:45,240 --> 00:34:47,840
How to measure it.

419
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:51,880
Your cane horses were around short -term and long -term.

420
00:34:52,040 --> 00:34:57,560
If we dare to reflect on where we are on that scale today -

421
00:34:57,720 --> 00:35:00,440
- And where we are going.

422
00:35:00,600 --> 00:35:07,280
You were on freedom of speech.
 Facebook does not see itself as a platform for freedom of speech -

423
00:35:07,440 --> 00:35:11,040
- The without defining itself as entertainment.

424
00:35:11,200 --> 00:35:16,760
How do we look at different arenas and what does it do with the value?

425
00:35:18,760 --> 00:35:23,160
Maybe I'm a little too philosophical?

426
00:35:23,320 --> 00:35:27,960
I read media researcher Mike Ananny who turns on freedom of speech:

427
00:35:28,120 --> 00:35:33,520
"We have talked for too long that freedom of speech is about being able to express myself."

428
00:35:33,680 --> 00:35:39,080
"We haven't talked enough about my right to hear different perspectives."

429
00:35:39,240 --> 00:35:44,680
The transferred sense may be able to kick off a discussion about the value.

430
00:35:44,840 --> 00:35:48,360
It may not be so concrete.

431
00:35:48,520 --> 00:35:54,960
But the idea of the conversation as a foundation in the artistic communication -

432
00:35:55,120 --> 00:35:59,160
- Over the genre you talk about and also in medial communication.

433
00:35:59,320 --> 00:36:05,680
That is, multi -way communication, not monological communication - not

434
00:36:05,840 --> 00:36:11,440
- Are a very threatened form, I think.

435
00:36:11,600 --> 00:36:17,240
It is also a matter that regardless of the source of funding, one might wonder:

436
00:36:17,400 --> 00:36:22,360
How should we fulfill the idea that I think many of us share -

437
00:36:22,520 --> 00:36:28,440
- If as many people as possible should be able to take part in as much culture and art as possible?

438
00:36:28,600 --> 00:36:34,120
It is also a prerequisite that the participants, the visitors, the audience ...

439
00:36:34,280 --> 00:36:38,560
What you now do for the type of art.
 The viewers.

440
00:36:38,720 --> 00:36:42,520
It is a matter of in the power discussion -

441
00:36:42,680 --> 00:36:49,120
- Although include them at the moment of art.
 Now it becomes less concrete -

442
00:36:49,280 --> 00:36:54,520
“But I think it is important to think about how they can be included.

443
00:36:54,680 --> 00:37:00,760
Because there will be no art without those who take part in it.
 Then there is no art.

444
00:37:00,920 --> 00:37:05,680
I think that in recent years we have been characterized a lot -

445
00:37:05,840 --> 00:37:12,520
- Of a reduced conversation with those who do not like us.

446
00:37:12,680 --> 00:37:16,960
That is why the art is so incredibly interesting.

447
00:37:17,120 --> 00:37:22,000
I once went to the cinema and saw a movie that I didn't really ...

448
00:37:22,160 --> 00:37:28,520
I went alone and afterwards I sneaked after people to hear what they said about it.

449
00:37:29,520 --> 00:37:36,680
I think that is one of the big stuff with art.
 Of course, it is an inner experience -

450
00:37:36,840 --> 00:37:41,040
- But what it creates from conversation and discussion with others.

451
00:37:41,200 --> 00:37:44,280
And you should not always agree with each other.

452
00:37:44,440 --> 00:37:47,680
A temperature meter so that the audience does not fall asleep.

453
00:37:47,840 --> 00:37:52,800
How many have backed from participating in some arenas in recent years -

454
00:37:52,960 --> 00:37:58,560
- Because there are different elements that make you not want to be there?

455
00:38:00,120 --> 00:38:05,520
Here we have some self -censorship.
 - Lars Anders, you wanted to jump in.

456
00:38:05,680 --> 00:38:09,320
We also have to talk here about the public -

457
00:38:09,480 --> 00:38:13,840
- And the institutions that maintain and constitute that public.

458
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:20,360
Thus, the joint conversation or the arena where different perspectives have been able to meet -

459
00:38:20,520 --> 00:38:25,600
- But where in recent years we have received an incredibly infected discussion -

460
00:38:25,760 --> 00:38:32,040
- In the limits of this public.
 It is called opinion corridor, filter bubbles, etc.

461
00:38:32,200 --> 00:38:36,920
What we have seen now that it has appeared so -called filter bubbles -

462
00:38:37,080 --> 00:38:41,160
–This different opinion clusters just sit and discuss internally -

463
00:38:41,320 --> 00:38:48,120
- is that the public has shrunk, or rather the range of opinion that is accepted.

464
00:38:48,280 --> 00:38:51,960
The one who then does not fit into the center -hold -

465
00:38:52,120 --> 00:38:56,120
- Risk to be completely frozen from the public conversation.

466
00:38:56,280 --> 00:39:01,560
Then we instead get a downpour public or several different public.

467
00:39:01,720 --> 00:39:04,680
It also provides that kind of moods -

468
00:39:04,840 --> 00:39:09,480
-When people who do not feel welcome in the public arenas -

469
00:39:09,640 --> 00:39:13,480
- Experience that there is an establishment that keeps them out.

470
00:39:13,640 --> 00:39:18,320
Here I believe that all actors, ie public cultural institutions - -

471
00:39:18,480 --> 00:39:21,400
—The public and private media houses -

472
00:39:21,560 --> 00:39:26,040
- And opinion leaders in social media, have a great responsibility.

473
00:39:26,200 --> 00:39:33,280
There has always been a limit to what is accepted and not in the public conversation -

474
00:39:33,440 --> 00:39:38,480
–But become these limits too narrow, other publics will arise -

475
00:39:38,640 --> 00:39:42,160
- Where different perspectives do not meet.

476
00:39:42,320 --> 00:39:47,240
Now there is research that says that is not really true.

477
00:39:47,400 --> 00:39:53,600
There are proper reports that we get broader networks and inflow in social media -

478
00:39:53,760 --> 00:39:56,960
- Enta in the bubbles that we actually live in.

479
00:39:57,120 --> 00:40:01,160
This is a bubble that we sit in - the cultural bubble.

480
00:40:01,320 --> 00:40:05,160
It is important to say.
 - You wanted to say something.

481
00:40:05,320 --> 00:40:09,560
I think you are right in it to some extent.

482
00:40:09,720 --> 00:40:15,040
A few years ago I did a performance that was about Ayn Rand.

483
00:40:15,200 --> 00:40:19,840
The interesting thing about it was all new meetings I received.

484
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:27,200
People I had never met from another public, if it is now divided.

485
00:40:27,360 --> 00:40:32,400
But also the pretty strong reactions I received from my own industry -

486
00:40:32,560 --> 00:40:35,880
–When did not think it was right in its place -

487
00:40:36,040 --> 00:40:40,320
- To lift a self -appointed ...

488
00:40:42,920 --> 00:40:49,400
... philosopher, but also writers, and her thoughts as part of a public conversation.

489
00:40:49,560 --> 00:40:53,000
So of course it needs to develop -

490
00:40:53,160 --> 00:40:58,760
- This is to broaden what is to be talked about.

491
00:40:58,920 --> 00:41:05,760
It does not deal with political positions per se, but about a story and a conversation.

492
00:41:07,520 --> 00:41:11,320
What I also think you have to do -

493
00:41:11,480 --> 00:41:16,760
-Is to lift himself out of its own permanent world of imagination about something -

494
00:41:16,920 --> 00:41:21,240
–And actually seriously take part in a different perspective -

495
00:41:21,400 --> 00:41:25,560
- As you did not think you would think was interesting.

496
00:41:25,720 --> 00:41:32,600
It is something that rests us all, to move our own performance limits.

497
00:41:32,760 --> 00:41:36,720
It feels like a good rounding comment.

498
00:41:36,880 --> 00:41:40,880
The logo for this context has been a wave.

499
00:41:41,040 --> 00:41:44,720
When we get more freedom, we also get more responsibility -

500
00:41:44,880 --> 00:41:48,040
- And it is very much the case as individuals.

501
00:41:48,200 --> 00:41:54,280
We should get a broad picture of everything before we decide.

502
00:41:54,440 --> 00:41:58,400
It is about a broad influx.
 To hear a lot of voices -

503
00:41:58,560 --> 00:42:03,880
- But also to take in different parts of the cultural landscape.

504
00:42:04,040 --> 00:42:07,360
That's something we all have to carry with us.

505
00:42:07,520 --> 00:42:10,280
A closing word from the rest of you?

506
00:42:10,440 --> 00:42:17,400
I just want to get back to how important an offensive artist policy is -

507
00:42:17,560 --> 00:42:22,680
- For artistic freedom.
 Not just the artist policy supports -

508
00:42:22,840 --> 00:42:28,200
- Without what Kerstin mentioned, the social security for freelance cultural creators -

509
00:42:28,360 --> 00:42:30,840
–And copyright.

510
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:36,440
If we are arranged for those systems, the artistic freedom will be greater -

511
00:42:36,600 --> 00:42:40,120
- For professional cultural creators in Sweden.

512
00:42:41,520 --> 00:42:45,040
I want to be the gloomy person - then

513
00:42:45,200 --> 00:42:51,360
–And warn of how dangerous an offensive artist policy can be for the artistic freedom-

514
00:42:51,520 --> 00:42:54,560
- If it ends up in the wrong hands.

515
00:42:55,840 --> 00:43:00,600
Wrong hands, yes.
 I think it's extremely important that all -

516
00:43:00,760 --> 00:43:05,400
- So from cultural bureaucracy as an employer perspective - -

517
00:43:05,560 --> 00:43:08,360
–And the union side ...

518
00:43:08,520 --> 00:43:14,160
That everyone is struggling in the same direction of professionalizing the cultural and art area-

519
00:43:14,320 --> 00:43:18,120
- For it will probably help us a bit on the road.

520
00:43:18,280 --> 00:43:24,000
- Kerstin, a closing word?
 - I just stood here and took in.

521
00:43:24,160 --> 00:43:27,560
- Yes, we would listen.
 -Yes exactly.

522
00:43:27,720 --> 00:43:32,040
I just want to agree with you, Lars Anders -

523
00:43:32,200 --> 00:43:36,440
–If this with how to adapt -

524
00:43:36,600 --> 00:43:39,800
- After systems, rules and criteria.

525
00:43:39,960 --> 00:43:46,680
It is fatal and therefore it is so difficult with support systems for art and media.

526
00:43:46,840 --> 00:43:50,080
- Even if you have the solution.
 -No I do not think so.

527
00:43:50,240 --> 00:43:53,600
A large applause to the panel.
