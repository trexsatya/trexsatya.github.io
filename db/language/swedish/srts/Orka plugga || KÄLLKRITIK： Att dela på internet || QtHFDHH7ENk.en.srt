1
00:00:01,200 --> 00:00:04,160
Damn nice.

2
00:00:05,360 --> 00:00:09,480
Like.
 But ... she comes home from India today.

3
00:00:09,640 --> 00:00:12,600
I had completely forgotten it.

4
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:17,920
It's true.
 It is actually cold outside.

5
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:33,920
Why do we share things?

6
00:00:34,080 --> 00:00:40,000
For the same reason we have always shared information.
 We communicate

7
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:43,840
-If the world, yourself or what you stand for.

8
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:50,120
The difference is that in the past, the views stopped between you and your friends.

9
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:54,280
Today you can quickly disseminate information to many.

10
00:00:54,440 --> 00:00:57,640
It is important to share what is true.

11
00:00:57,800 --> 00:01:01,320
The article you just shared is not true.

12
00:01:01,480 --> 00:01:05,120
For real?
 "Shit."
 Okay.

13
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:10,080
What should I think about so that it will not be so again?

14
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:14,720
To always be critical of what you read and take responsibility.

15
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:21,440
What you share affects the worldview of others, so you have to stand for it.

16
00:01:24,920 --> 00:01:30,720
Who is writing or saying something?
 Anyone you know or trust?

17
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:34,000
And why does the person say that?

18
00:01:34,160 --> 00:01:39,800
Is it to tell you something, or to make you think or buy anything?

19
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:44,760
Is it to amuse or scare, or to be stupid against someone?

20
00:01:44,920 --> 00:01:49,760
Ask yourself before you share: Is this true?

21
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:54,440
Is it important to you or for others?

22
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:57,720
Is it good for you or for others?

23
00:01:58,720 --> 00:02:02,920
Ask the same things when you find a Facebook group-

24
00:02:03,080 --> 00:02:07,440
-or a blog or when you look at a youtube clip.

25
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:12,360
Is the mascara really the best they have ever tested?

26
00:02:12,520 --> 00:02:15,680
Or can the person be sponsored?

27
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:19,200
Think just 25 years ago.

28
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:25,560
Then it wasn't easy to know what Olle from Mellerud thinks about Trump-

29
00:02:25,720 --> 00:02:29,040
-or what your cousin ate for breakfast.

30
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:32,120
Now it's just a few clicks away.

31
00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:47,960
I may not share this if I am not quite a hundred.
