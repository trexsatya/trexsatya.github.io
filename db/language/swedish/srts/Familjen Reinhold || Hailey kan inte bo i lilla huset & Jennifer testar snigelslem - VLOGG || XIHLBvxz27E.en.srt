00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:09.330
Good morning everyone.

2
00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:15.120
You who saw our latest vlog saw that Hailey would have a little party.

3
00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:19.890
So listen now definition party but she has girl friends at home and sleep down

4
00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:20.790
In the Lilla Hus.

5
00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:24.510
The heading read Hailey moves to the Little House and this was a little test at

6
00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:27.240
If we could live in the little house.

7
00:00:27.270 --> 00:00:28.350
So she is 13 years old.

8
00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:31.320
It is clear that she will live herself in a purple house, but thus,

9
00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:33.960
She will never solve it.

10
00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:38.700
Firstly, this is the case when you live alone or live in a house, then must

11
00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:45.510
You keep some order, some order and ready and so on.

12
00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:52.560
Alina Knäppkök stop running!
 But when I came down this morning I didn't panic

13
00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:53.520
And think about I can cut.

14
00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:55.110
I cut in here next to me now.

15
00:00:55.770 --> 00:01:01.410
A movie sequence that I filmed when I came in and just to the matter I hear that

16
00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:06.330
today my parents come home again and then I have to make sure it is like

17
00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:08.220
Nice here.

18
00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:11.880
So yes, we have little to work on you can say.

19
00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:14.070
But they have started and that is good.

20
00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:15.900
And I've started the dishwasher.

21
00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:21.270
But now I will take and wash because, to say the least, it is needed.

22
00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:25.560
And I will also fill up so we can get.

23
00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:29.280
When mom comes home they just come oh my god, how have you managed to get it like this

24
00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:29.790
fine.

25
00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:32.130
Yes, I'll tell you that you.

26
00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:35.760
We have cleaned up for happy life, but

27
00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:39.960
Even in here they have not been so.

28
00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:43.650
In here it is quite nice to turn on the underfloor heating a little because it is a little half raw

29
00:01:43.650 --> 00:01:44.150
out.

30
00:01:44.730 --> 00:01:50.760
But I'll start the dishwasher, the washing machine and clear a little so it will be

31
00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:53.610
Order of this torpedo also time enough.

32
00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:59.400
Even though it takes some time, I can imagine so it can stand there.

33
00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:02.610
So now it is.

34
00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:05.220
Quite so cleaned here again anyway.

35
00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:11.039
But yes, it was an experience you can say.

36
00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:15.660
Now I have difficult cleaning mania so I have said you can clean up after you.

37
00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:19.050
Now I mean some cleaning.

38
00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:24.580
This one needs to be lubricated with a little 5:56.

39
00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:27.250
But now we should at least go and fix the horses.

40
00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:28.780
We will take a walk with all the horses.

41
00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:32.230
Oh no, it's hugs.

42
00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:39.100
Oh a thousand wonders if it is possible to climb the hill without getting stilts?

43
00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:41.830
We may try.

44
00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:42.610
Maybe it goes.

45
00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:46.690
I have to bring the court with me and scratch the hoofs.

46
00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:48.310
It is quite soft in the forest.

47
00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:54.550
I wonder what it is that sounds, but that's my phone.
 But you feel it is plus degrees or it is

48
00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:56.200
zero and plus.

49
00:02:56.470 --> 00:03:00.430
But it was so damn good for their bodies to go climbing round and sometimes

50
00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:04.750
is it actually good not to ride without walking next door because then they get like

51
00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:06.670
Using the entire body.

52
00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:08.680
But working in a free way.

53
00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:09.940
If you understand what i mean.

54
00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:11.140
So we drive on climbing round.

55
00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:11.890
We hope it goes.

56
00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:15.070
Here I stand waiting for the kids to go and pick up the horses so we can go out and

57
00:03:15.070 --> 00:03:17.500
The Vafasen never got ready but picked up the horses.

58
00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:20.440
We're going to go out and walk in the woods and I leave the camera at home because it will

59
00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:23.140
Not something fun to film anyway so we'll see you afterwards.

60
00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:27.730
Now Robin and I will go down to the car business.

61
00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:31.540
I'll go down, stay there to

62
00:03:33.070 --> 00:03:35.260
The car dealer for my car has been inside.

63
00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:37.240
It has been sick.

64
00:03:37.270 --> 00:03:41.680
No, it has been in service so will pick it up now and then we will go to

65
00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:47.170
KC and buy some more Valentine's Day things or more.

66
00:03:47.290 --> 00:03:51.940
I have bought some and now I think I have to tie the bag and get in

67
00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:52.420
order on it.

68
00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:53.230
Because it's actually.

69
00:03:53.380 --> 00:03:55.870
Hi there are not so many here.

70
00:03:56.200 --> 00:03:58.120
Well, so it will be.

71
00:04:00.520 --> 00:04:06.190
There at Beckis Yes, it's small, but it's a bit bad with sledding back here actually

72
00:04:06.190 --> 00:04:08.890
And down here, there are not so many people.

73
00:04:08.890 --> 00:04:09.970
No, it's not.

74
00:04:11.050 --> 00:04:15.850
Yes, so now I have picked up the key to the car and will go home again.

75
00:04:17.709 --> 00:04:21.279
It's a bit of a scary weather outside, but I think.

76
00:04:21.610 --> 00:04:26.590
For now the snow is going away and I think hopefully there will be no more

77
00:04:26.590 --> 00:04:31.120
Snow now because I am moderately tired of snow, the gods should know.

78
00:04:31.510 --> 00:04:36.460
But home again and now the car is serviced and nice.

79
00:04:36.550 --> 00:04:40.780
God what good, then you can drive a few more miles with good conscience.

80
00:04:41.650 --> 00:04:44.380
What a thing we will see when you drive away.

81
00:04:52.350 --> 00:04:53.010
Perfect.

82
00:04:57.430 --> 00:04:59.980
I think you can take it by hand.

83
00:05:00.460 --> 00:05:05.140
Hi Gumman e so cuddly, so cuddly.

84
00:05:05.410 --> 00:05:11.830
Oh you will have lunch soon so now I'll take and drive home again.

85
00:05:12.310 --> 00:05:16.810
It is very fun now it is perfect ground to run kicks for the snow

86
00:05:16.810 --> 00:05:18.760
Am so packed and I'm so happy.

87
00:05:18.760 --> 00:05:23.590
I bought that fired last year and we just loved the little Calypso.

88
00:05:25.150 --> 00:05:26.290
Big and when you.

89
00:05:28.580 --> 00:05:29.660
No, very, very good.

90
00:05:30.140 --> 00:05:34.130
You who know me know that I kind of never cook and robin do all

91
00:05:34.130 --> 00:05:36.710
Cooking here at home which is so grateful.

92
00:05:36.740 --> 00:05:41.030
But now I have their girl friends here and Robin is doing lots of important

93
00:05:41.030 --> 00:05:42.350
Things I don't know what.

94
00:05:42.590 --> 00:05:49.430
And then I got to be the person responsible for cooking and it can be fun.

95
00:05:49.430 --> 00:05:50.930
Said myself very funny that I stand here

96
00:05:50.960 --> 00:05:51.620
Yes I understand it.

97
00:05:52.010 --> 00:05:54.380
But I now make chicken.

98
00:05:54.800 --> 00:05:58.010
I can't decide if there is enough chicken, but I

99
00:05:59.300 --> 00:05:59.800
Think so.

100
00:06:00.830 --> 00:06:06.440
So it will be chicken, rice and so I will make my own sauce that is very, very

101
00:06:06.440 --> 00:06:06.940
Tasty.

102
00:06:06.950 --> 00:06:07.640
It is

103
00:06:09.320 --> 00:06:12.020
creme fraiche and chili sauce.

104
00:06:12.020 --> 00:06:12.830
Then if you want.

105
00:06:13.040 --> 00:06:16.700
If you feel like this that you don't like creme fraiche then there is also

106
00:06:16.700 --> 00:06:20.720
bearnaise sauce and it may not be the best combo in the world, but it is still a

107
00:06:20.720 --> 00:06:21.620
Okay combo.

108
00:06:23.240 --> 00:06:27.320
But it's like this chili sauce and it gets super great and it's also very

109
00:06:27.320 --> 00:06:29.840
Fast lunch and you hip a little like this

110
00:06:31.310 --> 00:06:31.810
Kind of like that.

111
00:06:34.760 --> 00:06:35.260
Is it.

112
00:06:38.160 --> 00:06:38.660
it runs water somewhere

113
00:06:39.810 --> 00:06:40.380
Boils.

114
00:06:40.380 --> 00:06:42.570
Chicken fried chicken cook rice.

115
00:06:43.740 --> 00:06:44.340
No water flows.

116
00:06:46.950 --> 00:06:48.330
You should not be worried when I stand here

117
00:06:52.050 --> 00:06:52.590
And waiting.

118
00:06:53.310 --> 00:06:54.090
Yes I know.

119
00:06:54.180 --> 00:06:54.510
They are.

120
00:06:54.510 --> 00:06:55.530
Four pers.

121
00:06:56.340 --> 00:06:57.210
Four a little smaller.

122
00:06:58.260 --> 00:07:00.990
Although this is food -happy children, I think.

123
00:07:01.500 --> 00:07:03.660
After all, it is gymnasts they have to eat properly.

124
00:07:03.870 --> 00:07:06.930
Yes, as long as I should eat too.

125
00:07:07.170 --> 00:07:07.890
So we're five then.

126
00:07:09.480 --> 00:07:10.470
You can also eat.

127
00:07:11.220 --> 00:07:12.120
It's chicken.

128
00:07:12.840 --> 00:07:15.150
I do a little extra so we can take what is over

129
00:07:17.130 --> 00:07:17.630
I think.

130
00:07:18.570 --> 00:07:19.140
We go.

131
00:07:19.650 --> 00:07:23.370
What is the name of mussels yesterday?
 Makes you not get so measured.

132
00:07:23.730 --> 00:07:25.080
But you are gratefully measured.

133
00:07:25.110 --> 00:07:28.680
But you are not like when you eat type tacos and are measured for four days.

134
00:07:29.220 --> 00:07:30.480
So it's done.

135
00:07:30.480 --> 00:07:31.980
I think I pour on a little more chicken.

136
00:07:33.630 --> 00:07:35.520
This is rose chicken

137
00:07:37.230 --> 00:07:39.270
As we have received from my brother -in -law.

138
00:07:40.200 --> 00:07:40.860
To test.

139
00:07:47.240 --> 00:07:50.510
This is frozen because I want to hectare Robin's tractor pan because then could

140
00:07:50.510 --> 00:07:55.610
You have let it stand and put it so there will be heat from above too, but I did not get

141
00:07:55.610 --> 00:07:56.110
Borrow it.

142
00:07:57.890 --> 00:07:59.330
So now this will be.

143
00:08:01.820 --> 00:08:02.660
Will take a while.

144
00:08:03.110 --> 00:08:04.730
Oh what it boils here so

145
00:08:06.620 --> 00:08:11.570
I season with salt, garlic and pepper.

146
00:08:12.770 --> 00:08:14.510
There are three spices I like very much myself.

147
00:08:16.100 --> 00:08:17.570
It is important to spice up what you like.

148
00:08:17.990 --> 00:08:19.910
Then I also like chili, but I think we're not going to

149
00:08:21.470 --> 00:08:22.580
Konstra to it too much.

150
00:08:22.610 --> 00:08:23.480
And now I came up with one thing.

151
00:08:23.510 --> 00:08:24.650
She was allergic to nuts.

152
00:08:24.980 --> 00:08:26.570
Now we have no nuts here, but

153
00:08:28.550 --> 00:08:32.690
May be good to keep track of one of the girls to not tolerate nuts.

154
00:08:33.890 --> 00:08:34.730
But otherwise.

155
00:08:35.270 --> 00:08:35.770
Yes.

156
00:08:37.549 --> 00:08:38.510
We meat here.

157
00:08:39.020 --> 00:08:41.299
So now we are starting to show up here.

158
00:08:42.710 --> 00:08:46.310
It is still very cozy when you can do and usually we always take our food

159
00:08:46.310 --> 00:08:46.820
in the kitchen.

160
00:08:46.820 --> 00:08:50.810
It's not that it's super long here but it will be.

161
00:08:50.810 --> 00:08:52.460
So the food is getting ready anyway.

162
00:08:55.250 --> 00:08:56.990
Which feels good.

163
00:08:59.330 --> 00:09:00.170
Koelikok

164
00:09:01.760 --> 00:09:10.790
I just got a bid for the post that was also opened, but it is, I think

165
00:09:10.790 --> 00:09:11.510
from.

166
00:09:13.360 --> 00:09:13.930
Prime

167
00:09:15.310 --> 00:09:16.030
which is.

168
00:09:16.570 --> 00:09:17.200
Super fun.

169
00:09:17.200 --> 00:09:21.070
I have not ordered anything from Prime, but I have received.

170
00:09:23.170 --> 00:09:24.400
A lid with prime.

171
00:09:29.410 --> 00:09:30.400
You see what this was then.

172
00:09:33.460 --> 00:09:35.950
Prime Energy Drink Icepop.

173
00:09:37.770 --> 00:09:38.910
This is not allowed to taste this.

174
00:09:39.150 --> 00:09:43.380
We got Prime the other day but then it was not energy.

175
00:09:43.650 --> 00:09:44.400
So this one.

176
00:09:44.820 --> 00:09:49.170
If you have tasted this, please comment on it and comment on what you like

177
00:09:49.170 --> 00:09:50.250
Which prime you like.

178
00:09:50.640 --> 00:09:52.680
I have never really tasted them.

179
00:09:56.160 --> 00:10:01.290
Oh, it tastes like a mixture of probably the Red and the Blue.

180
00:10:01.290 --> 00:10:04.380
I'm probably just taste the red, but very cute.

181
00:10:04.530 --> 00:10:08.610
I rarely drink energy drinks, but thank you very much prime mmmm.

182
00:10:09.210 --> 00:10:12.420
Yes can drink a little neighbor or so.

183
00:10:12.420 --> 00:10:14.820
Give it to someone I know likes Prime very much.

184
00:10:14.820 --> 00:10:17.070
But I think it's fun to get these stuff because it's fun to test new

185
00:10:17.070 --> 00:10:17.580
things.

186
00:10:17.670 --> 00:10:19.500
But then I don't drink very much.

187
00:10:19.860 --> 00:10:25.590
Or not at all energy drinks because i don't think it is i experience when

188
00:10:25.590 --> 00:10:28.440
I myself drink energy drinks that I become very good then of course.

189
00:10:28.440 --> 00:10:30.150
But then I also get very, very tired.

190
00:10:30.420 --> 00:10:31.830
So the question is whether you become as well.

191
00:10:33.990 --> 00:10:36.810
That it becomes a negative effect of it.

192
00:10:37.350 --> 00:10:39.540
But then it was another delivery here.

193
00:10:39.540 --> 00:10:41.850
But it was to Robin I think because it was a

194
00:10:43.110 --> 00:10:44.280
Electric car charger.

195
00:10:46.140 --> 00:10:51.630
After all, our company has both my company but also Robin's company.

196
00:10:51.630 --> 00:10:55.860
We have the company together, among other things and what it looks like here.

197
00:10:56.310 --> 00:11:00.540
I am going crazy and then there may be deliveries with things that are not to me

198
00:11:00.540 --> 00:11:02.250
Sadly without him.

199
00:11:03.450 --> 00:11:04.020
But that's it.

200
00:11:04.020 --> 00:11:06.810
I'll go into Haley's room and twist one thing.

201
00:11:07.620 --> 00:11:13.530
After all, I've been the world's opponent of snail mucus.

202
00:11:13.530 --> 00:11:15.300
Think it's so disgusting.

203
00:11:15.720 --> 00:11:21.420
So just the thought of scratching killer snails in the face of myself getting

204
00:11:21.420 --> 00:11:23.850
me to want to start crying.

205
00:11:23.850 --> 00:11:24.350
Type.

206
00:11:24.360 --> 00:11:25.050
Now I say hello.

207
00:11:25.620 --> 00:11:26.940
Ah but then I get a psychic

208
00:11:26.940 --> 00:11:33.600
This then we have Hailey's solution to all the world's concerns and that is that

209
00:11:33.600 --> 00:11:35.430
Throw everything in and of itself.

210
00:11:35.430 --> 00:11:38.820
Maybe I should take on, but you see here, I panic.

211
00:11:42.240 --> 00:11:45.480
However, I think I might be able to take on a bit of that it looks like it does on

212
00:11:45.480 --> 00:11:50.250
her room because i called her ba can you go out to chloe and hang out with

213
00:11:50.250 --> 00:11:52.860
Her and then I think she released everything and went.

214
00:11:52.890 --> 00:11:58.980
But this is no exception and something she uses right on

215
00:11:58.980 --> 00:11:59.850
Took too much.

216
00:12:00.630 --> 00:12:06.810
It is such pads makeup pads and that is because she.

217
00:12:06.840 --> 00:12:10.920
So really, I will buy this.

218
00:12:10.950 --> 00:12:13.110
So to really lose it.

219
00:12:15.030 --> 00:12:16.110
And that's because she.

220
00:12:19.770 --> 00:12:22.140
I can't talk more now because I get so annoyed.

221
00:12:23.960 --> 00:12:25.280
She is so sloppy.

222
00:12:25.310 --> 00:12:31.100
What is it about children today to be so extremely sloppy?
 Or is it just mine

223
00:12:31.100 --> 00:12:33.950
Children for now I am losing it.

224
00:12:35.300 --> 00:12:39.620
So difficult to be parenthood.

225
00:12:39.800 --> 00:12:42.440
Help me please.

226
00:12:47.260 --> 00:12:47.800
I'm so tired.

227
00:12:48.520 --> 00:12:49.960
What I would say about snail mucus.

228
00:12:49.960 --> 00:12:55.870
Now that I've threaded myself out of Hailey's bedroom it is that I try that

229
00:12:55.870 --> 00:12:56.370
The other day.

230
00:12:56.590 --> 00:12:59.830
Because in my flow everywhere, it shows up how good.

231
00:12:59.860 --> 00:13:01.330
Snail mucus is here.

232
00:13:01.690 --> 00:13:04.510
Or this snail it's just this one.

233
00:13:05.950 --> 00:13:08.980
So I had to try and liked it kind of.

234
00:13:09.760 --> 00:13:11.260
Which character in me.

235
00:13:11.260 --> 00:13:14.170
Went in and ordered three for these products.

236
00:13:14.560 --> 00:13:17.860
I'll show them in another video because they haven't come home yet.

237
00:13:18.040 --> 00:13:22.930
But feel free to comment if you have tested snail mucus in any form.

238
00:13:23.110 --> 00:13:25.030
And feel free to comment

239
00:13:27.160 --> 00:13:32.380
What you liked about it, because I have been opponent because I think that

240
00:13:32.380 --> 00:13:37.600
it is so rough and think the idea of getting snail mucus in my face considering

241
00:13:37.600 --> 00:13:40.840
That I hate, does not hate, detest snails.

242
00:13:41.650 --> 00:13:42.550
At least the mucus.

243
00:13:42.550 --> 00:13:48.580
But if you think they could be named something else they could named the super

244
00:13:48.580 --> 00:13:52.180
Power Serum, I hadn't thought about it.

245
00:13:52.300 --> 00:13:53.860
But is it so snail in.

246
00:13:54.730 --> 00:13:56.830
But feel free to comment on what you think and

247
00:13:58.210 --> 00:13:59.710
If you have any product.

248
00:13:59.710 --> 00:14:02.740
I have understood that there are a few different such products, because there is, after all

249
00:14:02.740 --> 00:14:05.710
This is like this.

250
00:14:06.280 --> 00:14:09.100
And then there is some face cream, some eye cream I believe that I

251
00:14:09.100 --> 00:14:11.620
Ordered it was face cream and eye cream.

252
00:14:11.890 --> 00:14:12.430
But then I saw.

253
00:14:12.430 --> 00:14:15.610
There is another brand of this as well.

254
00:14:16.120 --> 00:14:18.850
So yes, there is little to choose from.

255
00:14:19.300 --> 00:14:24.670
But, as I said, many people feel many that follow us is a little

256
00:14:24.670 --> 00:14:28.390
in the same generation with bitch tok and other

257
00:14:28.720 --> 00:14:29.500
So yes.

258
00:14:29.770 --> 00:14:34.120
I must also say I use Charlotte Tilbury Flawless Filter.

259
00:14:34.510 --> 00:14:38.110
I really like that foundation, or it's more like a serum foundation

260
00:14:38.110 --> 00:14:43.030
But it is yes.

261
00:14:43.030 --> 00:14:49.840
I like a lot and even hudas baking powder also superb much fun,

262
00:14:49.840 --> 00:14:50.260
A lot of fun.

263
00:14:50.260 --> 00:14:51.550
That's a lot I can say.

264
00:14:51.550 --> 00:14:57.580
But Tik took to have learned or got a lot of tips on some fun products

265
00:14:57.580 --> 00:14:58.180
to use.

266
00:14:58.180 --> 00:15:01.390
Especially as my makeup routine has become completely different which is super fun.

267
00:15:02.110 --> 00:15:02.950
As a surprise.

268
00:15:03.160 --> 00:15:05.890
You haven't filmed Robin Robbans Kitchen

269
00:15:05.890 --> 00:15:07.900
It's a little dark in Robban's kitchen today.

270
00:15:08.590 --> 00:15:09.250
But then thought.

271
00:15:11.620 --> 00:15:13.480
I'm not so much.

272
00:15:15.640 --> 00:15:17.860
So then it will be at Robban's kitchen today.

273
00:15:18.460 --> 00:15:23.260
Then there is so much as pork, stew and more.

274
00:15:24.310 --> 00:15:30.730
Not so advanced, only with mushrooms and shallots and cream and good.

275
00:15:31.870 --> 00:15:32.650
What are you going to eat then

276
00:15:32.800 --> 00:15:34.810
I'll eat type.

277
00:15:37.180 --> 00:15:39.040
I'll eat chili its carne.

278
00:15:41.110 --> 00:15:41.610
And it will.

279
00:15:41.830 --> 00:15:43.180
Yes, it's chili without meat.

280
00:15:43.420 --> 00:15:45.010
Chili con carne, without minced meat.

281
00:15:45.790 --> 00:15:48.310
Without minced meat, mince and.

282
00:15:48.310 --> 00:15:48.940
Beans too.

283
00:15:49.060 --> 00:15:50.560
Or I will start, I

284
00:15:52.390 --> 00:15:52.890
and.

285
00:15:55.090 --> 00:15:58.150
Benna and I may see what is there.

286
00:15:58.570 --> 00:16:01.600
Kidney beans and white beans.

287
00:16:03.640 --> 00:16:07.960
Yes, and I would hectare with a small one so it gets easy like this.

288
00:16:07.960 --> 00:16:11.860
And have i crushed tomatoes

289
00:16:14.050 --> 00:16:15.010
And pepper

290
00:16:17.380 --> 00:16:19.780
Should I share it for you I can run it in my mixer.

291
00:16:20.050 --> 00:16:20.590
No I do not know.

292
00:16:20.590 --> 00:16:21.580
Have something I missed.

293
00:16:21.730 --> 00:16:22.360
Well Janne.

294
00:16:22.870 --> 00:16:23.920
I like my pieces.

295
00:16:24.670 --> 00:16:25.390
You are boring.

296
00:16:25.540 --> 00:16:26.530
Greece is a success.

297
00:16:27.490 --> 00:16:28.630
I didn't say it was bad.

298
00:16:29.080 --> 00:16:30.280
I said I like my pieces.

299
00:16:33.160 --> 00:16:37.600
Now finally my dad has come home again and they come up here and eat so I

300
00:16:37.600 --> 00:16:38.560
is about to

301
00:16:40.390 --> 00:16:40.890
slightly.

302
00:16:41.230 --> 00:16:42.310
Hello we have a friend left.

303
00:16:45.700 --> 00:16:47.290
We will be as many as the table.

304
00:16:47.500 --> 00:16:49.390
Yes the table full, seven.

305
00:16:51.910 --> 00:16:52.660
It gets cozy.

306
00:16:52.690 --> 00:16:53.710
I still think it's nice.

307
00:16:53.860 --> 00:16:59.080
And now it is praise for us who live on the west coast but who live in Västra Götaland.

308
00:16:59.380 --> 00:17:05.109
But it was so strange for no, just Kungsbacka but not Varberg.

309
00:17:06.550 --> 00:17:07.450
It's weird.

310
00:17:07.599 --> 00:17:08.230
Gothenburg.

311
00:17:09.099 --> 00:17:11.079
And also Skövde and Trollhättan and these.

312
00:17:11.560 --> 00:17:19.420
But the strange thing is that not Orust, they were portrayed from LOV.

313
00:17:19.420 --> 00:17:21.220
They follow the promise the week after that.

314
00:17:22.869 --> 00:17:26.440
But yes, then you have to take the opportunity and have some nice I think.

315
00:17:27.460 --> 00:17:30.310
Yes, so damn cozy.

316
00:17:31.930 --> 00:17:36.010
What dinner do you know amazingly!
 We go mussels.

317
00:17:36.010 --> 00:17:36.760
Mussels yesterday.

318
00:17:37.030 --> 00:17:41.800
Well, if you like it you get to taste Robins here.

319
00:17:41.800 --> 00:17:42.910
And Dad doesn't like mussels.

320
00:17:44.620 --> 00:17:45.580
Not salmon anyway.

321
00:17:47.010 --> 00:17:47.790
I can't.

322
00:17:48.420 --> 00:17:49.230
It's not salmon.

323
00:17:49.590 --> 00:17:51.210
It was good it was swinging.

324
00:17:51.600 --> 00:17:53.250
Robin is awesome at cooking and other side.

325
00:17:54.570 --> 00:17:55.380
Now it will be food.

326
00:17:56.610 --> 00:18:02.160
I go around looking for my mobile and pray what have I put it and so

327
00:18:02.160 --> 00:18:04.260
it is next to the coffee cup.

328
00:18:05.760 --> 00:18:06.450
Good check.

329
00:18:06.450 --> 00:18:11.880
God it flows so in my eyes and I look really tanned again.

330
00:18:11.880 --> 00:18:12.960
But I'm not.

331
00:18:12.960 --> 00:18:15.330
Or yes, on cheating.

332
00:18:19.840 --> 00:18:26.800
It's time to finish today's vlogg and i kind of got some reaction of

333
00:18:26.800 --> 00:18:31.630
Something so I've kind of swelling up on one eye during the night.

334
00:18:33.130 --> 00:18:34.720
I don't know if you see it, but it's like.

335
00:18:34.900 --> 00:18:36.580
Or the eyelid is completely swollen.

336
00:18:37.390 --> 00:18:42.430
But thank you very much for looking at this blog and thanks too

337
00:18:42.970 --> 00:18:46.570
To everything else you have looked at our channel.

338
00:18:46.690 --> 00:18:52.120
And one thing to this vlog we did before this blog that was about that

339
00:18:52.120 --> 00:18:55.240
We have been to funeral and that we would make a video where we pay tribute

340
00:18:57.040 --> 00:19:00.640
everyone, all, all or someone we know or someone we miss or if we have

341
00:19:00.790 --> 00:19:03.940
lost does not necessarily have to be a person.

342
00:19:05.020 --> 00:19:10.120
That video really has east with such fantastic comments.

343
00:19:10.300 --> 00:19:16.360
Feel free to go in and look at it and just be filled with love because it was so nice.

344
00:19:16.360 --> 00:19:21.820
And even though I sometimes said oh it was fun and you wrote something, everyone took

345
00:19:21.820 --> 00:19:26.680
Really opportunity and did, which I thought was incredibly beautiful.

346
00:19:27.700 --> 00:19:34.000
So thanks for that but now it is so that we will end this video and now so

347
00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:35.560
Also starts our sports holiday.

348
00:19:36.610 --> 00:19:41.320
We should not do anything special than we should go and compete, probably in

349
00:19:41.320 --> 00:19:44.590
This weekend at Grevagården Thursday to Sunday.

350
00:19:45.880 --> 00:19:47.350
So we really go forward.
