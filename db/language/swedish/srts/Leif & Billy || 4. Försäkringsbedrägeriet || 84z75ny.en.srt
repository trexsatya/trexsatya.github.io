1
00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:16.400
Cursed, damn badgers!

2
00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:22.640
Why should they go in and fuck under the kitchen like something fucking snuff?

3
00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:25.920
Leif, check out.

4
00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:32.240
- He bought a new dog.
 - Yes, the old dog was well insured.

5
00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:39.000
If you have been lying that a dog has died, you get out on the insurance, then?

6
00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:44.200
It is called insurance fraud.
 Pea Star!

7
00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:49.360
Then you can take out insurance and lie that gadgets have disappeared -

8
00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:55.720
- And get money on the insurance.
 What a fucking shit system!

9
00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:03.080
Leif, wait!
 Oh my God.

10
00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:08.920
- Insurance, now let's see ... —leif, it's too fucking illegal.

11
00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:14.360
Billy, haven't you talked about wanting to buy a Playstation 4?

12
00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:18.800
- Yes, but ... - we can buy what we want.

13
00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:26.120
We can have new plasma TV, massage chair and new computers.
 A data corner.

14
00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:29.320
Headphones and small glasses and everything ...

15
00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:34.560
We take out insurance and then we go and buy all the gadgets.

16
00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:40.160
Hips-Vips, where did they go?
 Nobody knows.
 We get both money and gadgets.

17
00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:43.560
You are a genius, the brother.

18
00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:49.840
- But how the hell are we going to pay the shit?
 –30 days invoice purchase.

19
00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:53.840
Hello!
 Hello Hello.
 It's ... Yes.

20
00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.200
I want to take out home insurance.

21
00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:01.280
Leif Öhman.
 Sörbäcken 113.

22
00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:07.440
Good.
 And it starts to apply today?
 Cannon.
 Hello Hello.

23
00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:10.760
Fy fuck, brother.
 Let's go.

24
00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:40.400
Damn, Leif, is it so damn smart to put the stuff in Tony's storage room?

25
00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:46.080
Billy, your fucking awake.
 What do you think happens if they look through the kitchen?

26
00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:51.320
In addition, Tony has not used the store in several years.

27
00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:57.520
Now comes the insurance company and the police.
 Let me take care of the talk.

28
00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:04.160
- A cup of coffee, maybe?
 -No thanks.

29
00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:14.280
Did you notice that someone had been in the house?

30
00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:19.520
Yes, we were out taking a walk, me and my brother.

31
00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:24.680
- When we got home, it was empty.
 - What did they get with them?

32
00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:28.440
Here is everything they brought with them.

33
00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:37.080
LED TV.
 PlayStation 4. VR massage chair.

34
00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:43.280
But all this is purchased today at ten past twelve.

35
00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:50.960
- You took out home insurance this morning.
 - Isn't it wrong with insurance?

36
00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:57.080
- Did you have locked all the doors?
 - They were locked when we came here.

37
00:03:57.240 --> 00:04:02.800
- No one.
 - How have they entered, then?

38
00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:10.960
So, I don't know how people do when they get in without seeing it.

39
00:04:16.920 --> 00:04:22.840
Whispers: I think it is a classic insurance fraud.

40
00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:26.480
I may know.
 Come.

41
00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:37.080
-That?
 - Yes, that wasn't there before.

42
00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:42.360
How can anyone get through that little hole?
 It is impossible.

43
00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:47.520
- It can be some short -grown.
 - Dwarves, maybe.

44
00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:50.720
Dwarves?

45
00:04:50.880 --> 00:04:57.120
- There is probably some criminal league.
 - A league with dwarves, then?

46
00:04:58.160 --> 00:05:03.240
I do not think so.
 There has not been a burglary in Sörbäcken since the 1980s.

47
00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:08.640
I am not an expert, but they may have entered through the chimney.

48
00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:14.120
Or if they had children with them, and then they put the children into the hole.

49
00:05:14.280 --> 00:05:20.680
- Then they have carried things out.
 - So it can actually be.

50
00:05:20.840 --> 00:05:25.840
I don't know what you think, but this sounds unreasonable.

51
00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:31.120
I can do nothing but investigate an insurance fraud.

52
00:05:31.280 --> 00:05:36.440
The chimney.
 It was the stupidest thing I've heard.

53
00:05:36.600 --> 00:05:42.840
- Good, Billy.
 Such a large hole.
 -I tried.
 Sorry, Leif.

54
00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:48.240
- It was a bad idea.
 - No, a damn bad idea.

55
00:05:48.400 --> 00:05:51.880
- Curse!
 -Quiet.

56
00:05:52.040 --> 00:05:57.160
Quiet?
 Here you try to be honest - and what the hell do you get for it?!

57
00:05:57.320 --> 00:06:00.840
Not a fucking piss.

58
00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:06.240
Can't we just call and say we got the shit back.

59
00:06:06.400 --> 00:06:12.040
- Then maybe they will close the investigation.
 - Oh, what you have become smart!

60
00:06:12.200 --> 00:06:18.480
You may be able to sell Christmas magazines for SEK 60,000 and pay off the debt.

61
00:06:18.640 --> 00:06:23.640
Oh, how smart!
 The World Cup in the Nobel Prize in intelligence goes to my little brother!

62
00:06:23.800 --> 00:06:29.800
The genius that has a brain cell.
 Billy "Fontanellkrasken" Öhman.

63
00:06:29.960 --> 00:06:33.320
There is only one thing to do.

64
00:06:33.480 --> 00:06:38.640
We have to make sure it looks like a league is on the move.

65
00:06:38.800 --> 00:06:42.040
Leif ... My God.

66
00:06:56.040 --> 00:07:00.360
The neighbor is notch in heels, he claims to steal from his apple trees

67
00:07:00.520 --> 00:07:04.080
I want to well but have to do something for our misery

68
00:07:04.240 --> 00:07:08.280
Father he is a proletarian and works late but can't afford jaw

69
00:07:08.440 --> 00:07:12.760
Of course I have my reasons and by the way, the neighbor is a millionaire

70
00:07:12.920 --> 00:07:18.360
I have to run, because if the neighbor can catch it a boring end

71
00:07:21.120 --> 00:07:26.440
You can call next week, then maybe I have dropped out.

72
00:07:31.760 --> 00:07:34.840
Sound from the TV

73
00:07:36.240 --> 00:07:41.560
Damn, I have anxiety, Leif.
 What have we given up on for fucking soup?

74
00:07:41.720 --> 00:07:44.760
My God, take it easy now, Billy.

75
00:07:44.920 --> 00:07:50.920
When the insurance company finds out the burglaries, they close the investigation.

76
00:07:51.080 --> 00:07:57.280
- We may have some ice in the stomach, only.
 - I have anxiety in my stomach!

77
00:07:57.440 --> 00:08:02.840
We have burgled with our own fucking neighbors.

78
00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:06.240
Take and calm down.
 Oh my God!

79
00:08:06.400 --> 00:08:10.120
What's with you?

80
00:08:11.520 --> 00:08:16.520
- put down the phone.
 - I call the police and admit.

81
00:08:16.680 --> 00:08:21.880
- Then maybe we get easier ... - do you hear what I say?
 Stop it...

82
00:08:22.040 --> 00:08:27.120
- Release the phone!
 - Don't smoke you up to me!

83
00:08:27.280 --> 00:08:32.800
Now it's me who decides something!
 Add, Leif!
 Release the phone!

84
00:08:32.960 --> 00:08:36.920
-Stop it!
 - Curse!

85
00:08:38.080 --> 00:08:41.920
THE PHONE IS RINGING

86
00:08:42.080 --> 00:08:45.120
Now you shut up.

87
00:08:47.920 --> 00:08:51.960
-Who is it?
 -Shut up.

88
00:08:52.120 --> 00:08:55.360
It was Leif Öhman here.
 Hello.

89
00:08:56.760 --> 00:09:00.040
Well?
 It was like the phase.

90
00:09:01.520 --> 00:09:04.680
Yes.
 Then we know.
 Good.
 Hello.

91
00:09:06.640 --> 00:09:11.720
What did I say?
 They have closed the investigation.

92
00:09:11.880 --> 00:09:16.960
You're joking?
 Is it true?
 YES!

93
00:09:17.120 --> 00:09:23.360
Damn, brother, you're a genius.
 I knew we would fix it.

94
00:09:23.520 --> 00:09:26.560
Calm down.
 Quiet.

95
00:09:33.920 --> 00:09:38.960
What the hell are you doing?
 Something fucking tantra-sex, right?

96
00:09:39.120 --> 00:09:45.280
Damn, go and get dressed.
 Filth!
 He had put something in his throat, so ...

97
00:09:45.440 --> 00:09:50.720
I don't want to hear what he got in his throat.
 The neighbors have had a burglary.

98
00:09:50.880 --> 00:09:55.840
Yes, we have heard it.
 Do you think that is me too?

99
00:09:56.000 --> 00:10:02.480
- No, Tony.
 Really not.
 - Were the village in the village think so.

100
00:10:02.640 --> 00:10:07.800
Bullen has spread some fucking reputation that I am burgled by people.

101
00:10:07.960 --> 00:10:14.960
- All think it's me, like.
 - Why do they think it's you?

102
00:10:15.120 --> 00:10:20.120
Because I haven't had a burglary.
 I am the Stockholm Fanten in the village.

103
00:10:20.280 --> 00:10:26.240
I hang in advance.
 But I know who is the thief.

104
00:10:28.880 --> 00:10:35.320
The bun.
 Do not you understand?
 He spreads a bunch of lies about me-

105
00:10:35.480 --> 00:10:40.520
- To get away yourself, so you have to help me.

106
00:10:40.680 --> 00:10:43.760
Help with what then?
 What did you think?

107
00:10:43.920 --> 00:10:48.960
We will go into his house and look for the theft.

108
00:10:49.120 --> 00:10:54.960
Tony, calm now.
 Let the police do the job.
 They have better control.

109
00:10:55.120 --> 00:11:00.200
- I and Billy don't have time.
 -Do you have tantra-sex, right?

110
00:11:00.360 --> 00:11:06.440
You killed my dog and put me there for poaching.
 You may have to snack up.

111
00:11:06.600 --> 00:11:12.640
- Yes, but then we are rid of then.
 -Yes.
 Come on.
 We will give the bull pussy.

112
00:11:13.400 --> 00:11:16.600
Switch!
 On with the clothes.

113
00:11:22.720 --> 00:11:27.880
Tony, now we do this quickly and discreetly.
 How should we come in?

114
00:11:28.040 --> 00:11:33.000
- I have a key.
 --Tony.

115
00:11:50.680 --> 00:11:53.200
Damn!

116
00:11:53.680 --> 00:11:57.840
- Have you found anything?
 -No.
 We have to pull.

117
00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:03.080
- Have you checked under the bed?
 - Yes, there are no stuff.

118
00:12:03.240 --> 00:12:08.240
-Let's go.
 - No, we have to find something.

119
00:12:08.960 --> 00:12:11.920
Polissir

120
00:12:12.720 --> 00:12:15.760
Silent, Tony.

121
00:12:25.960 --> 00:12:31.360
Police!
 Stay!
 Down on the ground!
 Down on the ground!

122
00:12:31.520 --> 00:12:37.280
-Quiet.
 It's not as it looks.
 - We will go there, Leif.

123
00:12:37.440 --> 00:12:43.520
It's not as it looks.
 I'm just here to check a little ...

124
00:12:44.480 --> 00:12:50.560
I have him!
 Hit with handcuffs!
 I have the burglar!

125
00:12:50.720 --> 00:12:56.840
He's dangerous!
 Get handcuffs here fast.

126
00:12:57.000 --> 00:13:02.880
I took the burglar.
 We took him on a deed.

127
00:13:03.040 --> 00:13:10.000
- What are we doing?
 Where are we going?
 -Do not know.
 Whose storage is this?

128
00:13:10.160 --> 00:13:15.960
- It's my storage room.
 - We might have to look at it.

129
00:13:16.120 --> 00:13:19.160
Damn.
 What are you doing?!

130
00:13:21.120 --> 00:13:25.160
-Oh my God!
 - What the hell have you put up with?

131
00:13:25.320 --> 00:13:30.800
- It is theft from all neighbors.
 - I haven't set this!

132
00:13:30.960 --> 00:13:35.960
- They have put me there again.
 - What storage is that?

133
00:13:36.120 --> 00:13:41.880
- A plus one will be two.
 Stop it!
 - It's the ones who have put me there!

134
00:13:42.040 --> 00:13:47.040
-Let me go!
 - Stick into prison, right?

135
00:13:47.200 --> 00:13:53.360
- I have a dog to take care of!
 --Tony, we feed your dog.

136
00:13:53.520 --> 00:13:59.520
Oh!
 They must not feed my dog!
 They have already killed a dog!

137
00:13:59.680 --> 00:14:04.880
—Usch, what a day.
 - Take your things.
 We contact the others.

138
00:14:05.040 --> 00:14:10.160
-Absolutely.
 -Good work guys.

139
00:14:11.320 --> 00:14:15.360
- It resolved well anyway.
 - You think so?

140
00:14:15.520 --> 00:14:21.160
What happens to the stuff in the store?
 We do not get anything out on the insurance.

141
00:14:21.320 --> 00:14:26.600
We have to take it up.
 We fix a fire insurance and tits on.

142
00:14:26.760 --> 00:14:29.880
But you hear, Leif ...

143
00:14:35.160 --> 00:14:38.680
