1
00:00:06.320 --> 00:00:09.760
Art - or weirdness?

2
00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:17.560
Sweden's art history is part of the huge story of our country.

3
00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:22.720
With some selected impacts, we will show art that depict changes -

4
00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:26.040
–And Creation power.

5
00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:44.520
An evidence that the guts were artists with incomparable fantasy-

6
00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:48.800
-And the ability to design, make up the Gothic Image Stones -

7
00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:53.400
- Being carved animals and humans form an exciting time chronicle.

8
00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:05.760
These have been in a group of maybe five picture stones in the same place.

9
00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:10.080
I imagine it is an old meeting place.

10
00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:15.240
There you have met, and also traditionally stories and stories -

11
00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:21.880
- Supported by these.
 In this way it's like a day's hometown -

12
00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:29.840
-Or a television program, where you get to know about knowledge and learn things.

13
00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:36.080
Maybe they were like the Vikings Television - the picture stones.

14
00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:39.160
Just like this you are looking at.

15
00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:44.400
You try to learn something, understand.
 "What would I have done?"

16
00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:49.840
In many ways, they were obviously like us.
 They sought the same explanations.

17
00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:56.640
They wanted to explain phenomena, through something that we would perceive as religion-

18
00:01:56.800 --> 00:02:01.040
- But they probably didn't make a difference, as we do today.

19
00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:05.080
We produce religion when it is a wedding.

20
00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:08.120
For them it was constantly present.

21
00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:13.360
Therefore, it is difficult to draw boundaries between everyday life, a practical life -

22
00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:16.560
- And a religious, sacred life.

23
00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:26.800
The Viking Age is a good time for Sweden, from the 7th century to the 12th century-

24
00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:33.160
- With both trade and looting, and new influences from other cultures.

25
00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:41.120
An image stone is just pictures, no text.

26
00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:45.320
So what they really mean is up to us to interpret.

27
00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:50.640
Like this famous scene - a man on an altar, stung by spear.

28
00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:57.760
It looks like a execution - with a bird over, which is associated with death.

29
00:02:57.920 --> 00:03:03.720
This stone is to tell a story about the King's daughter Hild-

30
00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:08.960
–And how she sets it in different contexts -

31
00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:12.880
- And the families are putting together.

32
00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:18.320
One problem we have with these is that you have looked at the pictures -

33
00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:22.600
- Out of the Icelandic fairy tales, above all.

34
00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:29.840
Then you have also seen scenes from them, but you must probably be open to -

35
00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:34.160
- That this can also be personal pictures.

36
00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:41.200
Yes, maybe it's a kind of diary about someone's adventure and death.

37
00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:45.560
There are also larger scenes that describe a world view -

38
00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:48.560
- And an explanation for everything.

39
00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:51.640
On this stone, the very largest -

40
00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:56.560
- We have something that we have perceived as the world tree here in the middle.

41
00:03:56.720 --> 00:03:59.480
This would then be the earth.

42
00:03:59.640 --> 00:04:05.680
Then we have what we believe are opposites, sunrise and sunset -

43
00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:09.240
- And the sun in zenit at the top.

44
00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:15.080
Then we get a situation where we have the world here -

45
00:04:15.240 --> 00:04:20.320
- Sol rise, the sun that stands in zenit, and then it goes down -

46
00:04:20.480 --> 00:04:25.440
- And gets picked up by the Night Ship, which is rowing where the sun will rise again.

47
00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:32.160
So we get an explanation on the cosmos.

48
00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:38.360
I imagine this much like the world of science in the 400s.

49
00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:51.200
So, it is art.
 It is.
 It is a way of expressing oneself.

50
00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:55.600
We see it, that the Viking Age is very artistic.

51
00:04:55.760 --> 00:04:59.760
This is someone who has wanted to shape events.

52
00:04:59.920 --> 00:05:04.000
If there are texts in Iceland, the pictures are here.

53
00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:07.200
It is a very good way of expression.

54
00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:11.320
Many of the stories are long.
 They can be 30, 40 verses.

55
00:05:11.480 --> 00:05:18.800
Here you can see scenes using only four, five pictures.

56
00:05:18.960 --> 00:05:24.720
Key scenes give us the whole story - provided people can.

57
00:05:24.880 --> 00:05:30.000
Therefore, I think it is a place where you meet, tells -

58
00:05:30.160 --> 00:05:32.920
–And trading to the next generation -

59
00:05:33.080 --> 00:05:37.880
- The legends, stories and myths that are important to life.

60
00:05:41.440 --> 00:05:43.480
