00:00:26,200 --> 00:00:28,420
Hello Hello!

2
00:00:28,900 --> 00:00:32,180
We are in Khao Lak in Thailand.

3
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:36,680
You should hang on to us for a whole day.

4
00:00:36,780 --> 00:00:39,680
It is half past nine o'clock in the morning.

5
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:44,020
Last time we were vlogs we were at another hotel.

6
00:00:44,120 --> 00:00:50,380
We had a great time there, but this hotel is a paradise for children!

7
00:00:50,440 --> 00:00:52,100
Yes it really is.

8
00:00:53,980 --> 00:00:56,820
Now we're going to have breakfast!

9
00:01:15,800 --> 00:01:22,100
Quite a little stuff.
 A yogurt, a chocolate milk, and scrambled eggs and bacon.

10
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:27,260
What is the best thing about hotel breakfast?

11
00:01:28,280 --> 00:01:31,080
Yoghurt!

12
00:01:35,240 --> 00:01:38,220
God!
 What happened there?

13
00:01:38,360 --> 00:01:41,160
Yoghurt!
 You just ... okay.

14
00:01:41,900 --> 00:01:44,340
Harry has always loved yogurt.

15
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:54,420
- What is the name of this pool?
 - The pirate pool.

16
00:01:54,480 --> 00:01:57,380
- Why?
 - Because it's pirates, do you see?

17
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:19,960
Should we take a photo to Instagram?

18
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:25,320
Of course.
 It is so fun for every day when you are at this pool so something happens.

19
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:31,740
If it is Bamse, or Captain T, or anyone else who comes and greets the children.

20
00:02:38,380 --> 00:02:41,320
Harry, stand next to it.

21
00:02:42,020 --> 00:02:43,020
There, yes.

22
00:02:49,640 --> 00:02:51,980
- Did you get a good card?
 - Yes, of course!

23
00:02:52,180 --> 00:02:56,920
- Now Alma and Harry play in the pool with friends.
 - Yes.

24
00:02:57,120 --> 00:03:02,460
- They have so many friends here.
 - They really find new friends all the time.

25
00:03:02,520 --> 00:03:10,340
Yes.
 Today, the children's club has closed, but otherwise in the mornings between 10am.
 10-12 goes shoulder ...

26
00:03:10,340 --> 00:03:12,520
... Axel at Bamseklubb!

27
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:17,460
I go to Bamseklubb, and the kids ... have some home time.

28
00:03:19,900 --> 00:03:23,060
Harry goes in there at the Bamseklubben downstairs.

29
00:03:23,100 --> 00:03:24,860
- Do you see?
 Yes, you see.
 - Yes.

30
00:03:24,860 --> 00:03:28,740
Up there there is something called 611, all ... thus ...

31
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:32,020
"Allå", "Allå, so" ...

32
00:03:33,260 --> 00:03:35,000
Sometimes it just gets wrong.

33
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:40,060
611. 611 club, for children between 6 and 11. It goes on.

34
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:43,180
They have great fun every day!

35
00:03:43,940 --> 00:03:46,400
- And we get some time ... - ... for ourselves.

36
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:47,460
- Yes.
 - Yes.

37
00:03:47,460 --> 00:03:53,300
They meet friends, they play.
 It is great TUI hosts who take care of them.

38
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:58,240
You can choose whether you want the children to be there in the morning or in the afternoon.

39
00:03:58,300 --> 00:04:01,100
Yes.
 There are two hours in the morning, and two hours in the afternoon.

40
00:04:01,160 --> 00:04:06,000
You can choose to be there both and then we would not even see our children, so we do not want that anyway.

41
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,220
No, exactly.

42
00:04:07,640 --> 00:04:12,160
Now we are going to go the blue big water slides!

43
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:57,380
- Alma, what is this?
 - It's a stone collection.

44
00:04:57,420 --> 00:04:59,960
First we dived down and picked them up from the bottom.

45
00:05:00,380 --> 00:05:02,280
Here is the big pile.

46
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:06,420
Here are white, orange, and black.

47
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:10,240
This is what it looks like on the bottom.

48
00:05:11,540 --> 00:05:15,780
I love that there is sand on the bottom.
 It's so good for my feet.

49
00:05:16,460 --> 00:05:18,520
Listen, should we go and have lunch?

50
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:35,940
Now we went down to a pool located right on the beach, and here is a great lunch restaurant.

51
00:05:36,060 --> 00:05:40,940
Alma and Harry found their friends directly in the pool, so they just disappeared.

52
00:05:42,540 --> 00:05:43,700
Hello!

53
00:05:48,040 --> 00:05:51,600
- Good with food after all the bathing, huh?
 - Mm!

54
00:05:51,660 --> 00:05:55,860
- What do you eat?
 - Egg Fried Rice.

55
00:05:57,720 --> 00:06:00,480
I'll dive in the ketchup!

56
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:13,600
Now we will show our fantastic house!

57
00:06:15,460 --> 00:06:17,120
Welcome!

58
00:06:23,640 --> 00:06:25,820
Here is our very own pool!

59
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:27,620
Woho!

60
00:06:31,920 --> 00:06:35,620
Alma has invited friends home several times, so we have had a pool party.

61
00:06:35,620 --> 00:06:40,920
Sat on some music, offered fruit and water.
 Great!

62
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:51,200
Now it is newly cleaned in here.
 So nice!

63
00:06:52,320 --> 00:06:55,800
Welcome in, in the small office.

64
00:06:59,080 --> 00:07:01,080
Wow!

65
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:04,620
They have really made an effort!

66
00:07:04,660 --> 00:07:05,840
- Mom?
 - Yes?

67
00:07:06,020 --> 00:07:10,880
That is your heart that thumps, and there is dad's heart that thumps.

68
00:07:10,920 --> 00:07:14,260
- And there is everyone's hearts that thump!
 - Is this everyone's hearts?

69
00:07:14,280 --> 00:07:17,060
Yes.
 Everyone's hearts that thump.

70
00:07:17,140 --> 00:07:21,160
So this is made of towels ... if you don't see it.

71
00:07:21,220 --> 00:07:25,060
- And that is made of stones?
 - No, these are small leaves.

72
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:27,120
It's petals!

73
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:28,500
Huh ...

74
00:07:28,860 --> 00:07:30,160
It's true!

75
00:07:30,540 --> 00:07:33,260
So this is mine and Axel's bed.

76
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:37,940
The children have this round bed couch.

77
00:07:38,180 --> 00:07:42,460
- Are you sleeping well here?
 - Mm, it's the worst princess bed!

78
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:45,940
It is quite quick to do a house tour here.

79
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:49,000
Here the children can look out at the pool.

80
00:07:51,760 --> 00:07:57,860
Here we have coffee, tea, water, and a refrigerator.

81
00:07:58,840 --> 00:08:02,540
And then it's the patio here.

82
00:08:08,020 --> 00:08:09,840
Out towards the sea.

83
00:08:16,860 --> 00:08:20,780
Here we have a bathroom and toilet.

84
00:08:25,260 --> 00:08:28,560
Here is our little dressing room.

85
00:08:28,640 --> 00:08:32,900
It can actually be closed like this ... "Now I'm going to change".

86
00:08:34,960 --> 00:08:37,280
And then you can choose someone here.

87
00:08:39,820 --> 00:08:42,180
- "K"?
 - Yes, what will it be?

88
00:08:42,260 --> 00:08:45,900
- "LOK" ... locomotive!
 - locomotive, yes.
 Good!

89
00:08:48,380 --> 00:08:50,280
We plug in a little.

90
00:08:54,260 --> 00:08:57,400
- Short.
 - "Short", yes!

91
00:08:59,140 --> 00:09:04,940
We alternate a little neighbor with pool swimming, because it gets so hot.

92
00:09:08,500 --> 00:09:11,840
- We wouldn't really be here now.
 - No, that's right.

93
00:09:11,860 --> 00:09:17,360
This trip is a collaboration with TUI and we would be in Khao Lak for two weeks, at two different hotels.

94
00:09:17,500 --> 00:09:24,380
But when we had been here at Mai Khao Lak for just a few days, we felt we had to stay longer!

95
00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:30,620
Yes.
 It was so wonderful to come here.
 The whole family came into a holiday loss.

96
00:09:30,700 --> 00:09:33,340
- Yes.
 - It was really nice.

97
00:09:33,380 --> 00:09:39,100
We should not be in New Zealand until the first February, so it was possible to solve because it is low season.

98
00:09:39,140 --> 00:09:40,180
Mm.

99
00:09:40,680 --> 00:09:45,980
Together with TUI, we have an offer for those who want to travel to this hotel.

100
00:09:46,120 --> 00:09:51,060
- A thousand SEK discount ... - ... if you use the code "Family" when you book.

101
00:09:51,180 --> 00:09:59,660
You can travel until March 2020, but you have to book before January 28 - ie this week.

102
00:09:59,860 --> 00:10:04,340
All info is in the descriptive text.
 Check it out!

103
00:10:23,880 --> 00:10:28,060
We are on our way to the store to buy cashews.

104
00:10:28,300 --> 00:10:34,460
There is a small fishing village ... A very old fishing village located right next to the hotel over here.

105
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:39,100
- I am very happy that it is there!
 - Yes, it will be a small adventure.

106
00:10:39,180 --> 00:10:43,880
Before we had children we had kind of lived in that fishing village.

107
00:10:44,820 --> 00:10:49,480
- Now I can really appreciate teddy bear and resort life.
 - Yes indeed.

108
00:10:49,560 --> 00:10:51,980
But it is so nice to be able to go and see something else.

109
00:10:52,040 --> 00:10:53,500
- Yes.
 - Yes.

110
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:03,080
They have a lot of massage here.

111
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:13,480
- That looks nice.
 - Yes.

112
00:11:29,020 --> 00:11:31,880
What many small hermit crayfish.

113
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:42,480
No thanks.

114
00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:45,780
- What did he say?
 - He asked if we wanted to eat there.

115
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:50,040
- No thanks.
 Did you say no thanks?
 - Yes exactly.

116
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:57,340
I didn't want to, because it was a bit boring to eat food and not buy nuts.

117
00:11:58,580 --> 00:12:00,440
Hands behind your back.

118
00:12:11,640 --> 00:12:13,140
Wow ...

119
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:14,900
Harry.

120
00:12:18,840 --> 00:12:22,240
- Here they have cashews.
 - And candy!

121
00:12:22,380 --> 00:12:26,220
Yes, lots of sweets.
 But not very Thai.

122
00:12:26,340 --> 00:12:28,240
This is Thai.

123
00:12:28,340 --> 00:12:30,400
- And this.
 - Yes.

124
00:12:30,500 --> 00:12:34,820
- And this!
 - No, Haribo is not Thai.

125
00:12:34,900 --> 00:12:36,640
But then, corner ...

126
00:12:36,740 --> 00:12:40,880
We have a question for the viewers, I just came up with.

127
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:42,960
- You know what?
 - No.

128
00:12:43,240 --> 00:12:48,600
- Do you want to watch a video where we test Thai candy?
 - Yes!

129
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:52,840
Comment below: Yes or No.
 We do as you please!

130
00:12:55,100 --> 00:12:59,800
It is six o'clock and soon the sun goes down.

131
00:13:00,380 --> 00:13:02,820
It is very nice to go here!

132
00:13:09,320 --> 00:13:14,700
We have made ourselves in order for dinner, and I noticed that everyone has been sunbathing today.

133
00:13:14,740 --> 00:13:16,220
- Yes.
 - Harry.

134
00:13:17,540 --> 00:13:20,660
Harry, you have red cheeks.

135
00:13:22,080 --> 00:13:24,800
- What are you looking at?
 - The water.

136
00:13:24,920 --> 00:13:29,580
Yes, of course it is nice.
 You get reassured by the beach.

137
00:13:54,120 --> 00:13:57,740
Now the sun went down.
 Do you hear, Alma?

138
00:14:02,360 --> 00:14:04,300
It's all crickets!

139
00:14:04,400 --> 00:14:08,420
- Oh, God what they play!
 - Yes!

140
00:14:08,520 --> 00:14:11,680
- They just started playing, after all.
 - Yes.

141
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:15,300
Alma, what do you think about this place?

142
00:14:20,580 --> 00:14:23,780
The best thing I've been to, I think!

143
00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:27,620
I ... I'm kind of distracted by the waves.

144
00:14:32,380 --> 00:14:35,900
♪ Hello Bamse, strongest is our teddy bear.
 ♪

145
00:14:35,900 --> 00:14:38,980
♪ But he doesn't like to fight!
 ♪

146
00:14:39,480 --> 00:14:46,160
♪ Dunder honey, Grandma's thunder honey he eats to be strong of course.
 ♪

147
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:49,180
- It's show here every night!
 - Yes.

148
00:14:49,260 --> 00:14:54,940
- Harry's favorite is Bamse.
 - Yes, and Alma's favorite is the disco coming soon.

149
00:15:16,120 --> 00:15:19,820
We are back in our house, and now we will sleep.

150
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:27,760
Thanks for watching this video!

151
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:30,860
Feel free to leave a thumbs up ...

152
00:15:30,960 --> 00:15:34,160
... or down.

153
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:37,820
- Or in between.
 - Yes, maybe ... exactly.

154
00:15:37,860 --> 00:15:42,120
Comment, ask questions, and have a great time until we see you next time!

155
00:15:42,180 --> 00:15:43,980
- See you!
 - Bye!

156
00:15:44,020 --> 00:15:45,620
Adjoken!
 Goodbye!
