1
00:00:00,256 --> 00:00:06,400
Yes, but this is that I sit here in the window now and enjoy and long for my first cup of coffee during the day

2
00:00:06,656 --> 00:00:08,960
And of course I have already been drinking

3
00:00:09,472 --> 00:00:15,616
So it was a lie but I think we brew a cup to and then I thought we are grazing a little

4
00:00:15,872 --> 00:00:23,440
Various things that you may want to know about the investment savings account.
 Stay Tuned

5
00:00:24,832 --> 00:00:25,600
Löfbergs ... Skåner cheese!
 Yes it is fine.

6
00:00:30,464 --> 00:00:31,488
4 cups

7
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:33,280
It is needed for a steady man

8
00:00:35,584 --> 00:00:36,608
One ... four and a half.

9
00:00:36,608 --> 00:00:41,898
Just on with the lid then it's just driving.

10
00:00:45,056 --> 00:00:46,592
A real Skåne cheese.
 It should sit nicely in the gut.

11
00:00:59,904 --> 00:01:01,184
Oh how good it is with coffee.

12
00:01:01,952 --> 00:01:02,720
Hello there

13
00:01:02,976 --> 00:01:04,768
Today I thought we'll talk about

14
00:01:05,024 --> 00:01:06,816
Investment savings account

15
00:01:07,328 --> 00:01:08,608
A so -called ISK

16
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:11,424
Do you know what it is?
 If you don't know that

17
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:13,472
So will you know that after this video

18
00:01:13,728 --> 00:01:19,360
You may have seen my video about shares for beginners so how to start investing in shares as a beginner

19
00:01:19,872 --> 00:01:21,152
Haven't seen it so check it out

20
00:01:21,664 --> 00:01:27,808
But there I explain that you need as a shell for your investments.
 That is exactly what the investment savings account is

21
00:01:28,064 --> 00:01:29,344
It's like a shell

22
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:34,976
Think like a small candy bag and in this one we pick different candy pieces

23
00:01:35,232 --> 00:01:39,072
That you are going to take home and eat to your Friday candy

24
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:45,728
And that's exactly how an investment savings account works that you choose for yourself what you want to pick in this bag

25
00:01:45,984 --> 00:01:49,568
And this particular investment savings account it works as a shell then

26
00:01:49,824 --> 00:01:51,360
Based on which type of

27
00:01:51,616 --> 00:01:54,176
Shells as you choose so you get to tax in different ways

28
00:01:54,432 --> 00:01:56,480
And with an investment savings account today

29
00:01:56,992 --> 00:01:58,784
So do you estimate a very low sum

30
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:04,160
On your investments so you don't pay as much tax if it is so that you make a lot of profit without

31
00:02:04,416 --> 00:02:08,000
You simply pay on how big this bag is

32
00:02:08,512 --> 00:02:11,072
The more money you stop in this bag

33
00:02:11,328 --> 00:02:13,120
The more tax you get to pay

34
00:02:13,632 --> 00:02:19,776
First I just want to thank you for now I see here that we are as much as 135

35
00:02:20,032 --> 00:02:21,824
Subscribers on this Youtube channel

36
00:02:22,336 --> 00:02:27,200
I just wanted to give a nice hand heart to you who are subscribers so big thanks

37
00:02:27,712 --> 00:02:32,064
I have posted type three videos and you subscribe already it is absolutely incredible to

38
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:35,136
They really prove that this knowledge is needed

39
00:02:35,392 --> 00:02:37,696
It is so that there is a demand

40
00:02:37,952 --> 00:02:44,096
Ok i'll try to stimulate it a bit like that so you can learn more about shares invest

41
00:02:44,352 --> 00:02:45,376
Savings and other things

42
00:02:45,888 --> 00:02:49,216
So are you so you didn't get so press this button here

43
00:02:49,472 --> 00:02:50,496
If you want

44
00:02:50,752 --> 00:02:53,312
If you don't want to no but you don't have to

45
00:02:53,568 --> 00:02:54,848
But thanks for looking

46
00:02:55,872 --> 00:02:59,968
So think that you start with the requirements to have an investment savings account

47
00:03:00,224 --> 00:03:06,368
The requirements Yes this is what the Swedish Tax Agency and the bank require from you to have an investment savings account

48
00:03:06,624 --> 00:03:12,768
The investment savings account is, after all, a Swedish idea, thus something that the government has picked up because we as

49
00:03:13,024 --> 00:03:19,168
People should make it easier to be able to save and invest only money so the usual requirements for you to have a

50
00:03:19,424 --> 00:03:20,960
Investment savings account it is

51
00:03:21,216 --> 00:03:27,360
1 You must be a private person so you cannot have an investment savings account as a company or company

52
00:03:27,616 --> 00:03:32,480
You must also be registered in Sweden so you cannot have accommodated the country

53
00:03:32,736 --> 00:03:35,552
because we have such high taxes in Sweden

54
00:03:35,808 --> 00:03:39,392
Without you have to have an address and you have to live in Sweden

55
00:03:39,648 --> 00:03:45,792
Is it that you live abroad if you can be a bit complicated to open an investment savings account and probably

56
00:03:46,048 --> 00:03:48,608
So you are not allowed to do it unfortunately

57
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:55,264
You also cannot own an investment savings account together with others is that you have

58
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:57,312
Investments that you want to share with others

59
00:03:57,568 --> 00:03:58,848
To invest together with

60
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:01,408
Then you can't do it on the investment savings account

61
00:04:01,664 --> 00:04:03,712
Without it for the individual

62
00:04:03,968 --> 00:04:04,736
So you and me

63
00:04:04,992 --> 00:04:08,320
So what are the benefits of having an investment savings account Jo

64
00:04:08,576 --> 00:04:14,720
Unlike equity insurance it is not so many but if you look at compare with

65
00:04:15,232 --> 00:04:18,559
a traditional share/fund account or also called AF account or securities depot

66
00:04:18,815 --> 00:04:20,351
So is the investment savings account

67
00:04:20,607 --> 00:04:22,399
It has quite a few benefits

68
00:04:23,935 --> 00:04:26,751
Free of charge an investment savings account should not cost anything

69
00:04:27,263 --> 00:04:28,799
The bank may not put on any fee

70
00:04:29,311 --> 00:04:32,383
Is there any fee on your investment savings account so escape

71
00:04:32,895 --> 00:04:33,407
Running

72
00:04:33,663 --> 00:04:34,431
No profit tax

73
00:04:34,943 --> 00:04:36,479
In an investment savings account

74
00:04:36,735 --> 00:04:37,503
Unlike stock.

75
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:39,551
Then you have to pay a tax on the profit

76
00:04:39,807 --> 00:04:41,087
You don't do this in an investment savings account

77
00:04:42,111 --> 00:04:43,647
Evance declare your business

78
00:04:44,159 --> 00:04:45,951
It makes the bank for you

79
00:04:46,463 --> 00:04:48,255
They report to the Swedish Tax Agency

80
00:04:48,767 --> 00:04:50,047
What you have purchased and sold

81
00:04:50,559 --> 00:04:56,703
And you don't have to worry so much about reporting purchasing courses and profits and cuts and everything possible

82
00:04:57,727 --> 00:04:59,007
Without it the bank takes care of the bank

83
00:04:59,775 --> 00:05:01,055
You own the shares

84
00:05:01,823 --> 00:05:03,615
On a capital insurance

85
00:05:03,871 --> 00:05:06,431
KF account or capital insurance that most people know so

86
00:05:06,943 --> 00:05:10,527
Then you do not own the shares but it is the bank that is on the shares

87
00:05:10,783 --> 00:05:11,295
But

88
00:05:11,551 --> 00:05:13,087
with an investment savings account

89
00:05:13,343 --> 00:05:14,879
Then it is that you actually own the investments

90
00:05:16,671 --> 00:05:19,743
You can move this whole shell from bank to bank

91
00:05:20,255 --> 00:05:24,607
If you have an investment savings account at, for example, Swedbank or

92
00:05:24,863 --> 00:05:26,399
Savings Bank or any other bank

93
00:05:26,655 --> 00:05:28,191
Yes but then you can move them

94
00:05:28,447 --> 00:05:28,959
From

95
00:05:29,215 --> 00:05:29,983
Point a

96
00:05:30,239 --> 00:05:30,751
To point b

97
00:05:31,007 --> 00:05:33,311
Without having to make a sale

98
00:05:33,823 --> 00:05:35,871
On other types of such accounts

99
00:05:36,127 --> 00:05:38,431
Then maybe it is so that you have to sell your shares first

100
00:05:38,943 --> 00:05:39,455
Before

101
00:05:39,711 --> 00:05:40,479
You move

102
00:05:41,247 --> 00:05:43,039
And then have to buy them again at the other bank

103
00:05:43,295 --> 00:05:44,063
It's pretty stupid

104
00:05:44,831 --> 00:05:46,879
Same with funds, it doesn't matter

105
00:05:47,903 --> 00:05:48,671
And it's smooth!

106
00:05:49,951 --> 00:05:55,327
Disadvantages to an investment savings account then what is there there are some jo there is absolutely there

107
00:05:55,583 --> 00:05:57,631
You have to pay taxes

108
00:05:57,887 --> 00:05:59,935
Even if your investments go down

109
00:06:00,959 --> 00:06:01,471
In other words

110
00:06:02,239 --> 00:06:06,847
The less money you have in this tax bag the less tax you have to pay

111
00:06:07,103 --> 00:06:09,151
But you still have to pay tax

112
00:06:09,407 --> 00:06:11,199
On, for example, share fund account

113
00:06:11,455 --> 00:06:16,319
Then it is true that then you can offset your losses against your winnings but you can't do that in an investment savings account

114
00:06:16,575 --> 00:06:17,343
That is a disadvantage

115
00:06:17,599 --> 00:06:19,135
A little premium though

116
00:06:19,647 --> 00:06:21,951
You cannot shiny shares in an investment savings account

117
00:06:23,231 --> 00:06:25,535
And most people don't do it so it doesn't matter

118
00:06:26,047 --> 00:06:29,119
Some securities you cannot have on an investment savings account

119
00:06:29,375 --> 00:06:31,935
For example, unlisted

120
00:06:32,191 --> 00:06:36,287
Shares not on the stock exchange if you were to buy some shares in an unlisted company

121
00:06:38,335 --> 00:06:41,407
For example, any family friend's company so you cannot have them in an investment savings account

122
00:06:41,919 --> 00:06:44,223
You pay tax on deposits

123
00:06:44,479 --> 00:06:48,063
Thus in case you deposit more money into your investment savings account then increase

124
00:06:48,575 --> 00:06:49,599
Thus the value of your

125
00:06:49,855 --> 00:06:50,623
Shells and then

126
00:06:50,879 --> 00:06:52,159
The tax is also increased

127
00:06:52,671 --> 00:06:53,183
think about it

128
00:06:53,439 --> 00:06:55,487
So for who is an investment savings account

129
00:06:55,743 --> 00:06:57,791
Yes but they could say is

130
00:06:58,047 --> 00:07:00,095
Anyone who wants to invest in the longer term

131
00:07:00,607 --> 00:07:02,399
Anyone who wants to invest with high risk

132
00:07:03,167 --> 00:07:09,311
I would say to the investment savings account fits almost all private individuals who have a longer time horizon when one

133
00:07:09,567 --> 00:07:11,103
want to invest their money

134
00:07:11,615 --> 00:07:12,639
and

135
00:07:13,151 --> 00:07:14,943
Yes, for example, if you

136
00:07:15,455 --> 00:07:21,343
Want a savings that you are thinking suitable for 3, 5, 10, 20, 50 years term

137
00:07:21,855 --> 00:07:24,415
Yes but then it is very good to have an investment savings account

138
00:07:25,183 --> 00:07:28,767
The investment savings account suits you who shop quite a lot

139
00:07:29,023 --> 00:07:31,071
That can't be able to declare your business

140
00:07:31,327 --> 00:07:35,679
Do you have a regular stock fund account then you have to declare each purchase and sell

141
00:07:36,191 --> 00:07:37,727
In the declaration

142
00:07:38,239 --> 00:07:41,823
But in an investment savings account so you don't have to do it because the bank takes care of it for you

143
00:07:43,615 --> 00:07:49,759
So an investment savings account is probably for those who shop a little more often and want pretty nice low tax

144
00:07:51,807 --> 00:07:57,951
That does not take money out often either without money that you deposit here and investing them should stay there

145
00:07:58,463 --> 00:08:04,607
So it is for those who have a little longer horizon so money that you have in an investment savings account they should stay there

146
00:08:04,863 --> 00:08:05,631
You should not take them out of there

147
00:08:05,887 --> 00:08:07,935
Because it only gives you a negative treasure

148
00:08:08,447 --> 00:08:13,055
So is it that you don't have an investment savings account I think you should take open one and invest there on

149
00:08:13,311 --> 00:08:15,615
myself and quite a few others

150
00:08:15,871 --> 00:08:20,479
Usually have an investment savings account at, for example, Avanza Bank or at Nordnet Bank

151
00:08:21,247 --> 00:08:27,135
I am not sponsored but the two but on the other hand I get a small commission if it is so that you open an account on the two banks

152
00:08:27,647 --> 00:08:28,927
and yes

153
00:08:29,439 --> 00:08:35,583
You have to do so, there are links below and do you not want to support me so it is completely calm and just go into Avanza or Nordnet in a

154
00:08:35,839 --> 00:08:38,911
New tab without pressing my links so I get no commission

155
00:08:39,423 --> 00:08:39,935
Go for it

156
00:08:41,471 --> 00:08:45,311
An investment savings account is good and I think that everyone should have

157
00:08:45,823 --> 00:08:49,663
So now that I've almost been drinking up my cup of coffee so I want to take care and say

158
00:08:50,175 --> 00:08:52,735
