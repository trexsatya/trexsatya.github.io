1
00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:38.640
Oh.

2
00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:44.360
It's not so careful.
 Are the lights lit?

3
00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:50.720
Well, you are already sitting.
 Frida had thought of another table placement ...

4
00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:54.080
Liljeholmens was too expensive ...

5
00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:59.720
Sit down for so long.
 You may apologize for the wrong music.

6
00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:03.160
I'll come, I'll just ...

7
00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:11.600
Stan Getz fits better.
 - It would have been another table placement ...

8
00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:15.640
–Eh ... - this is going to be good.

9
00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:22.400
Excuse the mess, we have not come in order.
 We'll repaint.

10
00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:27.040
It will be white, fresh.
 - Frida?

11
00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:33.440
It is not decorated at all, there is no decoration at all ...

12
00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:37.840
A little mood ... - No, it's going well!

13
00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:42.880
Spruce and rowan berries, but you have to think away ...

14
00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:49.640
You really have to apologize what it looks like.
 You can sit like this for a while.

15
00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:55.920
It would have been another location.
 Did I say that?

16
00:02:56.080 --> 00:03:02.240
And the wine ... broccoli was out of consumer, so then the food idea burst.

17
00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:07.480
So then it became Retsina, but think Chardonnay.

18
00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:15.640
And I was going to have been with Andreas, but Jenny got ahead.

19
00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:19.680
So Magnus and I have to continue.

20
00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:29.240
A little wine?

21
00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:41.120
Your Inner Landscape Has to Be Clean, or you will never find inner Peace.

22
00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:44.360
Wait a second.

23
00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:47.120
Keep Talking!

24
00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:52.040
Different Measures will help impurities flow away.

25
00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:56.360
At the center, we have adopted ...

26
00:03:56.520 --> 00:03:59.760
Guess Who I Am.

27
00:03:59.920 --> 00:04:02.880
"Hallo, Halli Balli ..."

28
00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:10.040
- You see?
 --No.

29
00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:13.520
I'm you!
 "Halli Balli ..."

30
00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:33.320
Peter, if you had to choose ...

31
00:04:33.480 --> 00:04:40.120
If you have to choose between Ylva, me and Tilde, who do you choose?
 Tell me!

32
00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:43.600
Sure I have the biggest chest?

33
00:04:43.760 --> 00:04:51.280
Ylva has done her in Estonia.
 Stupid, huh?
 They can inject anything.

34
00:04:52.040 --> 00:04:55.360
I have done mine in Örebro.

35
00:05:03.280 --> 00:05:08.440
Is it your car?
 It will be SEK 600 in fines.

36
00:05:12.600 --> 00:05:18.560
You could say that if you get a p -bot, it can be a bit like ...

37
00:05:18.720 --> 00:05:23.920
... anal sex.
 You park your cart in forbidden zone-

38
00:05:24.080 --> 00:05:27.400
- And get to lighten the scrotum.

39
00:05:36.280 --> 00:05:43.960
Why aren't you like other boys?
 Plays football and cuts cars ...

40
00:05:44.120 --> 00:05:47.960
I'm worried, Jesper.

41
00:05:48.720 --> 00:05:53.000
I'm so worried about you - for us.

42
00:05:53.800 --> 00:05:58.640
  Up to fight against the qualifier ... - Stop!

43
00:05:59.760 --> 00:06:04.560
I am only interested in state affairs.

44
00:06:04.720 --> 00:06:07.240
And food ...

45
00:06:41.960 --> 00:06:45.000
-Thanks.
 -What are you doing?

46
00:06:45.160 --> 00:06:48.480
Seriously speaking, this music ...

47
00:06:48.640 --> 00:06:51.840
This is the music we have!

48
00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:58.680
If we dance to this on Storgatan's day, we will be laughed at.

49
00:06:58.840 --> 00:07:02.640
We must have something tougher.

50
00:07:14.200 --> 00:07:20.480
-No!
 It's not Milkshake's music!
 - Shit in it then, do it.

51
00:07:21.480 --> 00:07:25.040
Then I am not.
 Come, Salle.

52
00:07:25.200 --> 00:07:31.600
No.
 I like you sharply, Maggan, but my place is with the dancers.

53
00:07:31.760 --> 00:07:35.680
There I belong.
 It is my life.

54
00:07:35.840 --> 00:07:40.040
- It's so I breathe.
 - Are you coming, then?

55
00:07:40.200 --> 00:07:42.200
Okay.

56
00:07:55.640 --> 00:07:56.640
This one was cool, I think.
 God, what a great thing.

57
00:08:00.720 --> 00:08:03.920
A "D", like.

58
00:08:04.080 --> 00:08:09.680
It's kind of a toastol.
 - Is it a toastol, Peter?

59
00:08:12.480 --> 00:08:15.480
Welcome to the "gender in focus".

60
00:08:15.640 --> 00:08:19.280
We will talk about female sexuality.

61
00:08:19.440 --> 00:08:27.240
Men and women are the same in a lot, but girls turn on other things.

62
00:08:28.240 --> 00:08:33.800
Does the expert have any tips?
 How to win a woman's heart?

63
00:08:33.960 --> 00:08:40.240
I can answer that question with a single word: clitoris.

64
00:08:40.400 --> 00:08:44.520
- Clitis, clitoris, clitoris.
 -Clitoris.

65
00:08:44.680 --> 00:08:49.640
But purely, if I want to get a girl interested ...

66
00:08:49.800 --> 00:08:53.200
Then you stimulate the clitoris.

67
00:08:53.920 --> 00:08:58.800
We know that many guys have a hard time finding clitoris.

68
00:08:58.960 --> 00:09:03.240
We will show.
 This is the clitoris ...

69
00:09:03.400 --> 00:09:09.600
- You have drawn a schematic picture ... - Yes, that's right.
 It is here.

70
00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:16.160
If I have understood it correctly, the clitoris should sit ... here.

71
00:09:17.720 --> 00:09:23.880
That's right.
 Many guys are looking for wrong, maybe here ...

72
00:09:24.440 --> 00:09:30.400
So it is wrong.
 It sits here, in connection with the genitals.

73
00:09:30.560 --> 00:09:33.520
A bit like the man's purse.

74
00:09:33.680 --> 00:09:39.600
I hope we were able to help you guys at home.
 Thanks!

75
00:09:47.360 --> 00:09:54.280
- I'll probably touch me now.
 - No, don't go home!
 One is worn to ...

76
00:09:54.440 --> 00:10:00.840
- No, it's a day tomorrow too.
 - What stiff you have become.

77
00:10:14.040 --> 00:10:18.200
- The magic is here.
 –Wa?

78
00:10:18.360 --> 00:10:21.920
That she has a stomach ...

79
00:10:29.680 --> 00:10:35.640
My ladies and gentlemen, I get to present the dance group in front of others:

80
00:10:35.800 --> 00:10:38.680
Milkshake!

81
00:11:43.640 --> 00:11:46.320
Thanks!

82
00:12:24.520 --> 00:12:28.920
But Jarmo, you are also crap.
 No...

83
00:12:29.080 --> 00:12:36.520
Then I say you are pretty dishonest.
 I just say what I think.

84
00:12:36.680 --> 00:12:39.640
I actually do it!

85
00:12:39.800 --> 00:12:44.720
Peter, stop there.
 Do not write Jarmo clearly.

86
00:13:15.920 --> 00:13:21.800
Drink plenty of water and try to rest, as long as you are healthy in general.

87
00:13:21.960 --> 00:13:27.880
Yes, otherwise I'm healthy as a nut core.
 It's just vision ...

88
00:13:28.040 --> 00:13:32.880
- Sometimes it disappears.
 - Flims it?

89
00:13:33.040 --> 00:13:37.120
No, it doesn't flicker.
 It gets carbon black.

90
00:13:37.280 --> 00:13:42.120
As if you put a bag over your head.

91
00:13:42.280 --> 00:13:47.320
Check it ... I think you should do.
 That sounds tough.

92
00:13:47.480 --> 00:13:52.160
It is.
 It is the worst in traffic.

93
00:13:52.320 --> 00:13:57.720
The day before yesterday I was out on the E4.
 I was blind for half an hour!

94
00:13:57.880 --> 00:14:04.840
- It was pure luck that nothing happened.
 - Make a routine check.

95
00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:10.800
The worst is when it lasts for a week.
 The job is suffering.

96
00:14:10.960 --> 00:14:15.960
And so it has started to bleed from my ears.

97
00:14:17.240 --> 00:14:23.400
- Testing can Jang.
 It should help.
 - No, I don't like martial arts.

98
00:14:32.760 --> 00:14:37.400
... then I don't do nothing anymore ...

99
00:14:37.800 --> 00:14:43.880
- So you can't do ... - I listen to you!

100
00:14:44.040 --> 00:14:50.920
-I mean it!
 --... for you to do nothing!

101
00:14:51.080 --> 00:14:56.040
You can play later.
 I have to do nothing ...

102
00:14:57.720 --> 00:15:00.760
THE DOORBELL RINGS

103
00:14:57.720 --> 00:15:00.760
Who could it be?

104
00:15:02.120 --> 00:15:08.920
Hi, I'll check the ventilation.
 There has been information about it.

105
00:15:10.040 --> 00:15:15.840
Yes, but now you have to wait a bit here, and then you come in.
 Come in!

106
00:15:16.880 --> 00:15:21.200
I can take the rest and come back late ...

107
00:15:21.360 --> 00:15:27.360
Will not be on the question!
 You are hungry, who has worked all day.

108
00:15:27.520 --> 00:15:30.160
I just ate.

109
00:15:30.320 --> 00:15:36.920
- Then we should have each grogg ... - we?
 No, I'm on duty.

110
00:15:37.800 --> 00:15:41.120
Well.
 But you...

111
00:15:41.280 --> 00:15:47.040
I pour it into a jar.
 So you can drink it when you're done ...

112
00:15:47.200 --> 00:15:50.520
These are my flowers.

113
00:15:53.000 --> 00:16:00.720
A fern ... and this vase I got from my work buddies -

114
00:16:00.880 --> 00:16:04.040
- When I quit Wissels.

115
00:16:04.200 --> 00:16:07.440
Is not it nice?

116
00:16:08.280 --> 00:16:12.080
He is peeing

117
00:16:37.880 --> 00:16:42.880
-I must go now.
 The fans ... - No, you stay!

118
00:16:47.320 --> 00:16:51.520
Have you ever seen such a neighbor?

119
00:16:51.680 --> 00:16:55.880
Look, have you seen such tits?
 Hello?

120
00:17:02.120 --> 00:17:08.960
- You have been Key Account Manager ... - Yes, for institutional customers.

121
00:17:09.120 --> 00:17:14.120
Are you the best at private or public customers?

122
00:17:14.280 --> 00:17:21.200
It is difficult.
 Public business is often larger to the volume ...

123
00:17:21.360 --> 00:17:27.960
It is about building lasting relationships.
 I'm pretty good at that.

124
00:17:28.120 --> 00:17:31.920
This sounds great, I think.

125
00:17:32.080 --> 00:17:37.800
I think our CEO also wants to talk to you.
 We set up a time.

126
00:17:37.960 --> 00:17:43.440
It says you have worked as a disc jockey too ...

127
00:17:43.600 --> 00:17:47.840
A friend ran a club - Visage.

128
00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:54.000
- I don't know.
 - It was niche against synth music.

129
00:17:56.680 --> 00:18:02.280
So you have worked as a disc jockey at a synth club.

130
00:18:03.640 --> 00:18:08.040
If I say "The Number of the Beast" ...

131
00:18:08.200 --> 00:18:13.840
- It's a hard rock record?
 - Yes, with Iron Maiden from 1982.

132
00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:18.520
One of hard rock's most classic albums.

133
00:18:18.680 --> 00:18:24.200
Excuse me, but I wouldn't call it a classic.

134
00:18:24.720 --> 00:18:28.280
Here at the company we do.

135
00:18:28.440 --> 00:18:33.600
Depeche Modes first album from 1981 is a classic.

136
00:18:35.160 --> 00:18:38.080
So you are synthesis?

137
00:18:39.320 --> 00:18:42.080
Yes.

138
00:18:42.240 --> 00:18:45.480
Then unfortunately I have to ask you to go.

139
00:18:46.720 --> 00:18:50.520
Only tatters listen to hard rock.

140
00:18:50.680 --> 00:18:54.080
Synthesis, then?
 Four gays and one computer.

141
00:18:54.240 --> 00:18:57.640
What the hell is that?
 To stand like this!

142
00:18:59.840 --> 00:19:03.120
Do you want to look at synth dance, then?
 Like this!

143
00:19:16.120 --> 00:19:19.840
Stop!
 What are you doing?

144
00:19:21.080 --> 00:19:24.280
He is synthesis.

145
00:19:58.320 --> 00:20:02.000
Idiot in sight!

146
00:20:20.840 --> 00:20:23.280
Hello?

147
00:20:25.840 --> 00:20:30.680
  ... Sure she'll live in a hundred years

148
00:20:30.840 --> 00:20:34.280
Hello!
 Hello, Elsa - Britta.

149
00:20:35.000 --> 00:20:42.360
  And when she has lived, and when she has lived

150
00:20:42.960 --> 00:20:48.960
  And when she has lived in a hundred years

151
00:20:49.800 --> 00:20:56.480
  Yes, then she should be shot, yes, then she will be shot

152
00:20:57.000 --> 00:21:03.080
  Yes, then she should be pushed on a wheelbarrow forward!

153
00:21:05.320 --> 00:21:08.720
So it's time to come.
 Are you new?

154
00:21:08.880 --> 00:21:13.760
- Yes, it's Jan.
 - I don't want to know what you are called.

155
00:21:13.920 --> 00:21:19.480
- Yes, I am 85 years old today.
 -Oh.
 You have to congratulate.

156
00:21:20.440 --> 00:21:23.520
Then we will see what to do.

157
00:21:23.680 --> 00:21:27.720
There has been a small accident in the bedroom.

158
00:21:27.880 --> 00:21:30.880
There is no danger - just a little kiss.

159
00:21:31.040 --> 00:21:37.760
Hang the sheet on the line in the bathroom, so we save on the laundry.

160
00:21:37.920 --> 00:21:42.240
-Okay.
 - Yes, we do!

161
00:21:52.920 --> 00:21:56.400
Excuse me to bother this late.

162
00:21:56.560 --> 00:22:03.360
Can I interest you for a machine that improves the indoor environment?

163
00:22:03.520 --> 00:22:09.240
- I don't know ... - I like to demonstrate it for free.

164
00:22:11.160 --> 00:22:19.040
You can say a little jokingly that Nasa in the door can be likened to ...

165
00:22:19.760 --> 00:22:21.920
... anal sex.

166
00:22:22.080 --> 00:22:25.720
You have to nag to get in.

167
00:22:25.880 --> 00:22:30.720
But well inside you will receive an abundant dividend.

168
00:22:39.720 --> 00:22:42.960
God, what it is guilty!

169
00:22:44.400 --> 00:22:48.000
What you are cool, little old man.

170
00:22:50.880 --> 00:22:54.480
Is it nice when I tear in the stump?

171
00:22:55.360 --> 00:22:58.600
What a nice scalp you have.

172
00:23:10.240 --> 00:23:14.480
Last summer, Marianne went, that's my daughter ...

173
00:23:14.640 --> 00:23:19.280
Then she went to Latin America on vacation.

174
00:23:19.440 --> 00:23:22.680
I thought, what should she go there and do?

175
00:23:22.840 --> 00:23:27.360
They probably have their own problems without her.

176
00:23:27.520 --> 00:23:32.560
Don't just stand there!
 Sit down, for God's sake.

177
00:23:33.120 --> 00:23:35.840
And then...

178
00:23:36.000 --> 00:23:43.040
Then she comes home here and is completely broken on her face.

179
00:23:43.200 --> 00:23:47.520
She is scaling her nose and her hair is tough.

180
00:23:47.680 --> 00:23:51.600
And so she wears a poncho.

181
00:23:51.960 --> 00:23:56.880
A poncho with fringes and llama ...

182
00:23:57.800 --> 00:24:02.920
Not only that.
 Next to her stands a man.

183
00:24:04.040 --> 00:24:08.320
A small, small man.

184
00:24:09.760 --> 00:24:16.000
With a similar poncho with llama and fringes.

185
00:24:16.600 --> 00:24:20.720
And long, black, dark hair.

186
00:24:21.240 --> 00:24:28.320
I thought that, my God, she has adopted a girl from Peru.

187
00:24:28.480 --> 00:24:35.640
But she said, "Mom, this is Carlos. He came with me from Peru."

188
00:24:36.520 --> 00:24:41.560
It is a full grown man standing next to her!

189
00:24:42.960 --> 00:24:50.000
It is not wise.
 And a few days afterwards I broke the femur.

190
00:24:50.160 --> 00:24:56.280
So horrible.
 I have to hurry, because I will visit many others ...

191
00:24:56.440 --> 00:25:01.160
Oh Lord Jesus, I have to go to the toilet.

192
00:25:01.560 --> 00:25:06.520
- The Laxy Comprehension has started to work.
 - But the sheet?

193
00:25:06.680 --> 00:25:11.840
Yes, now you can use your wise brain, young man.

194
00:25:21.360 --> 00:25:25.360
-Is it going well?
 -Of course.

195
00:25:26.760 --> 00:25:29.720
Move.

196
00:25:33.200 --> 00:25:36.360
Yuk.
 Opp with your arms!

197
00:25:57.840 --> 00:26:05.000
- Paul?
 Can't we see you in our spare time?
 -Absolutely!
 And hang out more privately.

198
00:26:05.160 --> 00:26:10.520
Yes, and drink a beer.
 It's so stiff here in the office.

199
00:26:10.680 --> 00:26:15.440
- Can we not set a time?
 -Yeah absolutely.

200
00:26:20.200 --> 00:26:26.320
Then we'll see ... I like to drink beer with you when fuck goes on dry land.

201
00:26:28.320 --> 00:26:33.440
It's a little early for me.
 I can imagine...

202
00:26:33.600 --> 00:26:36.760
... when pigs fly.

203
00:26:36.920 --> 00:26:42.880
So you mean the day when ordinary pigs have learned to fly?

204
00:26:43.760 --> 00:26:49.120
Otherwise, I have a gap here when hell freezes.

205
00:26:50.360 --> 00:26:55.440
- But never, what do you think about it?
 -That's a good idea.

206
00:26:55.600 --> 00:27:00.520
I write: "Never meet Paul in his spare time."

207
00:27:00.680 --> 00:27:03.880
It feels good.
 See you never!

208
00:27:08.160 --> 00:27:13.280
God, a sushi sign that burns up ...

209
00:27:13.440 --> 00:27:16.760
Can I have it, Peter?

210
00:27:18.440 --> 00:27:21.680
What is this?

211
00:27:21.840 --> 00:27:26.240
Can you tattoo Robinson - Jesus?

212
00:27:53.360 --> 00:27:55.560
SVT Program Setting: Annika Wiehager

213
00:28:00.200 --> 00:28:03.880
You?
 I can not sleep.

214
00:28:06.600 --> 00:28:10.080
Count sheep, then.

215
00:28:13.080 --> 00:28:16.040
I do that all day.
