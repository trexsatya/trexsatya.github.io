1
00:00:10.496 --> 00:00:14.080
This step is about how you can help your group become more secure.

2
00:00:14.848 --> 00:00:19.968
When a new group is formed, the members naturally are not very secure with each other.

3
00:00:20.992 --> 00:00:24.832
As the group spends time together, security usually emerges.

4
00:00:26.112 --> 00:00:30.976
A well -functioning group is characterized by, among other things, great confidence and security.

5
00:00:32.512 --> 00:00:38.656
They dare to fail, dare to share ideas, dare to give each other feedback and help each other.

6
00:00:40.192 --> 00:00:43.520
Here is a metaphor that highlights the importance of helping others.

7
00:00:44.544 --> 00:00:47.360
A farmer grows lots of fine corn on his farm.

8
00:00:48.896 --> 00:00:52.992
Every year he reports his corn to a competition for the area's best crops.

9
00:00:53.504 --> 00:00:54.784
And every year he wins.

10
00:00:55.808 --> 00:01:00.928
One year he was interviewed by a reporter who wanted to find out the secret behind the award -winning corn.

11
00:01:01.184 --> 00:01:04.000
The answer made the reporter very astonished.

12
00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:09.120
The farmer told me that he always shared the grain with his neighbors.

13
00:01:09.888 --> 00:01:12.448
"But how can you give the grain to your competitors"

14
00:01:12.704 --> 00:01:13.728
The reporter asked.

15
00:01:14.752 --> 00:01:16.032
"Oh," the farmer said.

16
00:01:16.544 --> 00:01:18.080
"It's not that hard to understand"

17
00:01:18.592 --> 00:01:20.128
"The wind captures pollen"

18
00:01:20.384 --> 00:01:21.664
"And for the one from field to field"

19
00:01:22.944 --> 00:01:29.088
“If my neighbors grow substandard corn, cross pollination will make my corn gradually deteriorate

20
00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:30.368
It too ”.

21
00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:34.208
"If I want to grow good corn, I must therefore help my neighbors".

22
00:01:35.488 --> 00:01:38.048
How you can help others feel safe

23
00:01:39.072 --> 00:01:43.680
Encourage ideas from others and try to avoid getting into a defensive position.

24
00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:51.104
When others make mistakes on training or competition, the most common thing is to do nothing special and just drive on.

25
00:01:52.128 --> 00:01:55.200
However, some choose to bark at the person who made the mistake.

26
00:01:56.480 --> 00:02:02.368
However, given how people work in groups, we need to be careful about how we choose to act on the faults of others.

27
00:02:03.136 --> 00:02:06.976
In fact, most people feel insecure when someone bark at them.

28
00:02:07.232 --> 00:02:09.024
Which often leads to more mistakes.

29
00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:12.864
So the opposite of the effect they really want.

30
00:02:13.888 --> 00:02:18.496
That being said, it is not always wrong to bark or mark when someone makes violations.

31
00:02:18.752 --> 00:02:22.336
Especially not when it comes to things that the person can actually control.

32
00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:27.968
It is, for example, under the person's control how it behaves towards its teammates.

33
00:02:28.224 --> 00:02:32.320
But less under the person's control whether the pass goes to the correct address or not.

34
00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:38.208
As a teammate, it can therefore be good to be extra supportive when someone makes a mistake.

35
00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:40.256
Or get tired and underperform.

36
00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:44.096
How you yourself can challenge your insecurity

37
00:02:45.632 --> 00:02:51.520
If there is an opportunity to be selected for a competition or match, you will surely want to show off your best side all the time.

38
00:02:52.288 --> 00:02:54.592
It can lead to you starting to act safe.

39
00:02:54.848 --> 00:02:57.664
And do not carry out actions that risk going wrong.

40
00:02:57.920 --> 00:03:01.504
Which, paradoxically, often leads to a worse result.

41
00:03:02.784 --> 00:03:04.320
In the skill acceptance

42
00:03:04.576 --> 00:03:07.392
You were asked to challenge yourself and make mistakes.

43
00:03:08.416 --> 00:03:11.488
It can also be about daring to ask when you do not understand anything.

44
00:03:11.744 --> 00:03:17.888
Such as asking for help from coaches or from your teammates even if it feels like you then show

45
00:03:18.144 --> 00:03:18.656
you weak.

46
00:03:19.424 --> 00:03:23.520
Make sacrifices for your teammates, although it may inhibit you in the short term.

47
00:03:24.544 --> 00:03:29.664
In team sports, it can be about working home even though you may be able to cope less in the next attack.

48
00:03:30.176 --> 00:03:34.784
In an individual sport, it may be to take the time to help others in their preparation.

49
00:03:35.296 --> 00:03:38.112
Although you may want to focus most on yourself for a while.

50
00:03:39.136 --> 00:03:41.696
Why it is good can be explained in a few different ways.

51
00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:47.840
As in the metaphor about the farmer and the corn, it can be directly favorable for you to help others.

52
00:03:48.608 --> 00:03:51.424
If others get better, you will be better too.

53
00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:55.264
Which is a particularly simple conclusion to draw in team sports.

54
00:03:56.288 --> 00:04:00.640
By helping others also increases the likelihood that they will help you back.

55
00:04:00.896 --> 00:04:02.688
When you have worries.

56
00:04:03.712 --> 00:04:06.528
Finally, it is also about emotion and courage.

57
00:04:07.552 --> 00:04:13.440
On the one hand, usually creates a good feeling inboard when we helped others which can lead to a better performance.

58
00:04:14.464 --> 00:04:17.536
When it comes to courage, it is about daring to be vulnerable.

59
00:04:17.791 --> 00:04:20.095
Being able to be in insecurity in the short term,

60
00:04:20.351 --> 00:04:23.167
In order to achieve greater security in the longer term

61
00:04:23.423 --> 00:04:24.447
both for yourself

62
00:04:24.703 --> 00:04:25.983
And for others in your group.

63
00:04:27.007 --> 00:04:28.543
This week's training tips

64
00:04:29.823 --> 00:04:33.919
A secure group where members are happy also has a better opportunity to perform well.

65
00:04:34.687 --> 00:04:39.295
Help others become safe by supporting, comforting and encouraging ideas.

66
00:04:39.551 --> 00:04:41.599
And that the members challenge themselves,

67
00:04:41.855 --> 00:04:43.903
Although it leads to mistakes on cards.

68
00:04:44.927 --> 00:04:49.023
Challenge your own insecurity this week by doing what you are uncomfortable with

69
00:04:49.279 --> 00:04:50.303
and sacrifice you for the team.
