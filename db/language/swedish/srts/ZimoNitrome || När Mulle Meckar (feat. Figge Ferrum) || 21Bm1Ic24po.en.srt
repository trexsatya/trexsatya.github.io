00:00:09.428 --> 00:00:12.554
'97 - 2023 forever king of the streets


3
00:00:12.554 --> 00:00:15.400
Cruisin' round in something fat I threw together from scrap


4
00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:19.084
With all my shooters finally out from the penitentiary


5
00:00:19.084 --> 00:00:22.537
I don't fuck with EPA-dunk, smoke them like I smoke my skunk


6
00:00:22.537 --> 00:00:25.651
Keep them inside of my trunk, mix some lean and take a sip


7
00:00:25.651 --> 00:00:28.965
Got my plug Freddy Ferrick always by my side


8
00:00:28.965 --> 00:00:31.965
Dealing scrap and dealing bars, my brother makes it shine


9
00:00:31.965 --> 00:00:34.759
Me ang Gary G, we head home, roll up five


10
00:00:34.759 --> 00:00:38.133
I'm the hood's Kanye West, and Mulle, Sweden's Eminem


11
00:00:38.133 --> 00:00:41.230
Pull up with some shawties, it is sesh and conversation


12
00:00:41.230 --> 00:00:44.413
But my opps better watch out or they will receive a grenade


13
00:00:44.413 --> 00:00:47.892
Your pathetic life I'll make sure to delete


14
00:00:47.892 --> 00:00:51.126
Cut your body parts and sell them on Tradera


15
00:00:51.126 --> 00:00:54.143
Patrolling the hood with Mulle my homie


16
00:00:54.143 --> 00:00:57.776
Darn it. Sasha is gone and got lost again.


17
00:00:57.776 --> 00:01:00.991
When Gary rolls them, he rolls them really fat


18
00:01:00.991 --> 00:01:04.052
Rollin out and roll along with Tramadol and Ketamine


19
00:01:04.052 --> 00:01:07.265
Five-O pullin up, yeah they think that they are tough


20
00:01:07.265 --> 00:01:10.598
Just they wait until they get to meet my boxer Bouncer


21
00:01:10.598 --> 00:01:13.747

22
00:01:13.747 --> 00:01:16.728
Got so many spare parts on my junkyard, gotta search it


23
00:01:16.728 --> 00:01:20.051
Wallah shawty, come on here and shake that junk of yours


24
00:01:20.051 --> 00:01:23.274
I never leave the house without an automatic rifle


25
00:01:23.274 --> 00:01:26.482
I used to search for gadgets from the morning until dusk


26
00:01:26.482 --> 00:01:29.800
Nowadays I'm in competition with Elon Musk


27
00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:32.658
Started from the bottom, built my car and boat and house


28
00:01:32.658 --> 00:01:35.709
You can call me "Mr. Pest Control" 'cuz I get so much pussy


29
00:01:35.709 --> 00:01:42.378
Cruisin around with my clique and if I spot a cute chick, then I've always got a gimmick that can get her on my dick


30
00:01:42.378 --> 00:01:43.757
Erm, drip check?


31
00:01:43.757 --> 00:01:45.989
Blue bib overalls and black hat


32
00:01:45.989 --> 00:01:48.943
"Looking Good" as we say in America


33
00:01:48.943 --> 00:01:52.069
When Gary rolls them, he rolls them really fat


34
00:01:52.069 --> 00:01:55.172
Got so many bitches that I got visit from PETA


35
00:01:55.172 --> 00:01:58.469
The government wants me in prison for good


36
00:01:58.469 --> 00:02:01.868
The ladies, they say: "nicely built, baller ride"


37
00:02:01.868 --> 00:02:05.088
When Gary rolls them, he rolls them really fat


38
00:02:05.088 --> 00:02:07.987
Always been a G ever since "Building Cars" left its BETA


39
00:02:07.987 --> 00:02:11.306
If they're coming after you then start to fucking shoot


40
00:02:11.306 --> 00:02:14.598
Gary Gadget will teach you to build AK47s


41
00:02:14.598 --> 00:02:17.737
I got bands stacked to the ceiling, we're building capital


42
00:02:18.803 --> 00:02:20.948

00:02:24.093 --> 00:02:26.882
Hello Gary, don't you wanna come over to my place?


45
00:02:26.882 --> 00:02:30.489
We take Adderall and Molly, mixing Xanax with coke


46
00:02:30.489 --> 00:02:33.372
Injecting everything, every widget and thingamajig


47
00:02:33.372 --> 00:02:36.411
Never worried on street, whatever I carry


48
00:02:36.411 --> 00:02:39.764
With some of lean in the the doubly cup, we'll arrange a juice party


49
00:02:39.764 --> 00:02:43.339
Whacked a fucking plug, but I don't feel no remorse


50
00:02:43.339 --> 00:02:46.466
Chilling with a shorty up in Ferrous Field


51
00:02:46.466 --> 00:02:49.524
The dirt road is too muddy, you need a better set of tires


52
00:02:49.524 --> 00:02:52.846
Deal so much gasoline that you can call me OPEC


53
00:02:52.846 --> 00:02:55.504
Sippin on a Norrlands Guld and you know we keep it lit


54
00:02:55.504 --> 00:02:59.251
Or we'll build yet another gadget, and sip on that moonshine


55
00:02:59.251 --> 00:03:02.565
Move however I want, I don't care about the odds


56
00:03:02.565 --> 00:03:05.785
'Cuz you know I rep Djupforsen
