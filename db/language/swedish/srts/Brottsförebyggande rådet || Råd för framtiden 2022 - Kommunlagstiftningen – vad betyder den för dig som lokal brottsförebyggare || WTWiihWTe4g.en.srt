00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:10,200
Hello.

2
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:21,320
How nice.
 We would be gathered here to talk about the coming legislation-

3
00:00:21,400 --> 00:00:25,240
-And what it can mean for you who work locally.

4
00:00:27,280 --> 00:00:31,760
The reason we have this session, it is both to capture the ER-

5
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:37,280
-It's the beginning of a needs inventory of how we should design our support to ER-

6
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:42,600
-If the future legislation.
 It's a way for us to start ...

7
00:00:42,680 --> 00:00:45,400
"This is what we think."

8
00:00:45,480 --> 00:00:51,240
You can give feedback.
 How right do you think we end up in our discussions?

9
00:00:51,320 --> 00:00:55,600
Before we start, I'll introduce ourselves on stage.

10
00:00:55,680 --> 00:01:00,200
My name is Charlotta Gustafsson, I am from the Crime Prevention Council.

11
00:01:00,280 --> 00:01:03,880
-To right on me I have ... -malin wiktoreng.

12
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:10,280
I am here as a national coordinator for the county administrative boards' crime prevention work-

13
00:01:10,360 --> 00:01:15,720
-But I also exist as regional coordinator in Västerbotten.

14
00:01:15,800 --> 00:01:17,440
My name is Greta Berg.

15
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:22,320
I am responsible for crime prevention issues at Sweden's municipalities and regions.

16
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:25,800
My name is Håkan Jarborg Eriksson.

17
00:01:25,880 --> 00:01:30,600
I work at the Police Authority.
 National operational department.

18
00:01:30,680 --> 00:01:34,720
Where we at a development center, as I am responsible for-

19
00:01:34,800 --> 00:01:40,240
-Works with the development of crime prevention work.

20
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:45,320
Good.
 Now I take ...

21
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:54,200
I thought we were doing a short recap on the law, which is proposed.

22
00:01:55,360 --> 00:02:00,560
There maybe Greta, Håkan and Malin want to fill up, but I'm starting a bit.

23
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:07,400
The law does not describe what a municipality should do, but more how a municipality should work.

24
00:02:07,480 --> 00:02:12,000
It is both a strength and a weakness so clearly.

25
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:18,480
What you print a lot in the bill is that you have to work knowledge -based.

26
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:23,440
There should be a situation picture, which includes both a survey-

27
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:29,200
-A causal analysis and an information about the conditions one has-

28
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:31,680
-To prevent crime.

29
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:39,200
Based on the situation, one should formulate-

30
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:43,680
-The action plan, ie how to work with the questions-

31
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:50,200
-And after every two years do a follow -up of the work.

32
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:53,600
This should be done with the police-

33
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:58,320
-But also with other actors concerned.

34
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:00,800
For this to be off-

35
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:07,840
-also stipulates the law which organizational conditions need to be in place.

36
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:12,480
Then there should be a strategic collaboration forum-

37
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:17,640
-Or a crime prevention council that disposes of these issues in the municipality.

38
00:03:17,720 --> 00:03:23,320
There should be a coordinator feature for the questions, which becomes a contact surface-

39
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:27,080
-Both internally and externally for collaboration.

40
00:03:27,160 --> 00:03:30,080
It must be signed collaboration agreements-

41
00:03:30,160 --> 00:03:35,080
-With the parties involved, who are important for the crime prevention work.

42
00:03:35,160 --> 00:03:39,520
It is the responsibility of the municipal management that this exists.

43
00:03:40,760 --> 00:03:45,000
-Have I missed something?
 -No.
 I can say briefly too ...

44
00:03:45,080 --> 00:03:49,600
... that the information I have received from Justitie and Skr-

45
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:54,080
— will the Law Council's remit be ready before the election-

46
00:03:54,160 --> 00:03:57,720
-And the bill will be completed after the election.

47
00:03:57,800 --> 00:04:03,600
The law is expected to enter into force on July 1, 2023, for those who do not know.

48
00:04:04,760 --> 00:04:10,720
As Morgan said this morning, there is quite a great agreement around this law.

49
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:15,080
-Over party borders.
 -Yes exactly.

50
00:04:15,160 --> 00:04:20,320
Should we start by looking at how you have answered ...

51
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:23,920
Are you with us, Lars?

52
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:27,200
... on the survey.

53
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:30,720
So far you had answered ...

54
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:35,240
Which was the one who answered at half past two today?

55
00:04:35,320 --> 00:04:39,560
Quite a few crime prevention from the municipality that has responded.

56
00:04:39,640 --> 00:04:43,280
That's 34 percent.

57
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:50,320
About 30 percent are municipal police or area police.

58
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:56,000
It is fairly evenly between these two strong local crime prevents.

59
00:04:56,080 --> 00:05:00,720
Then you also see that there are other answers from social services-

60
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:07,080
-The managers, politicians, officials or something else.

61
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:12,960
You can have with you when we report the answers that this is how it looks.

62
00:05:13,040 --> 00:05:14,520
Shall we take next?

63
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:25,080
Then we asked the question of how ready you are for the upcoming law.

64
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:31,320
You are ready.
 Very ready, even.

65
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:36,400
It's only 13 percent, I think.
 I don't see, it's so damn little here.

66
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:40,480
But 13 percent who say that they are not ready at all.

67
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:46,560
Quite a few who do not know.
 You do not know what requirements come with the law.

68
00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:51,480
Then we take the next one.

69
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,680
You can also see from these pictures-

70
00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:07,720
-That you think you yourself are more ready than the municipal organization is ready.

71
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:15,880
-Should we comment on this?
 -I can comment on it.

72
00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:19,640
Many who have responded are crime prevention-

73
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:25,640
-And many have many years of experience and are ready to tackle the challenges-

74
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:28,760
-But you may not have your organization with you.

75
00:06:28,840 --> 00:06:32,360
The municipal management is not ready, the municipality has not cooperated.

76
00:06:32,440 --> 00:06:37,400
One might not get the mandate you wish or money-

77
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:40,280
-To drive crime prevention work.

78
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:45,720
Those who respond to the survey are more ready than the organizations themselves.

79
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:50,440
It is positive and it feels safe-

80
00:06:50,520 --> 00:06:54,240
-That so many at the individual level feel ready.

81
00:06:54,320 --> 00:06:58,040
70 percent we were up in. Very ready or ready.

82
00:06:58,120 --> 00:07:01,560
It was a higher figure than I had expected-

83
00:07:01,640 --> 00:07:07,000
-Also if it is a crime prevention who is here at this conference.

84
00:07:07,080 --> 00:07:12,720
It is still the target group that will be hugely involved in the work.

85
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:16,720
It feels very good.
 Then it is natural in a way-

86
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:23,160
-That the organization, as a system seen, may not be as far ahead.

87
00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:26,440
But still, 50 percent.

88
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:31,600
There are good conditions when you see these figures.

89
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:34,280
I can only agree.

90
00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:40,080
After all, we meet all committed and knowledgeable crime prevention coordinators-

91
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:45,760
-Ote in the municipalities everyday, in our professional life.

92
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:50,400
We know how much good jobs are also done.

93
00:07:50,480 --> 00:07:55,120
It is nice to have it confirmed through these answers

94
00:07:55,200 --> 00:08:01,080
That you feel ready to take on this new legislation.

95
00:08:01,160 --> 00:08:04,360
While we have talked, a question has come in.

96
00:08:04,440 --> 00:08:08,560
It is whether the Law Council has commented on the bill.

97
00:08:08,640 --> 00:08:15,040
Here it says "your" bill.
 It is not our bill.

98
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:18,080
This comes from the government.

99
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:22,680
-But do you know anything about the Law Council?
 -The Law Council?

100
00:08:22,760 --> 00:08:29,720
I think the Law Council comments on the law council's remit, and it is not finished.

101
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:35,160
There is certainly someone in the room who knows this better than I am, but I drive a little volley.

102
00:08:35,240 --> 00:08:41,000
When the Law Council's remit is complete, the Law Council expresses itself, then the bill is written.

103
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:44,000
No, the answer is.

104
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:48,800
-You write a question and we answer directly.
 -So smooth.

105
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:53,320
It feels like a heavy system, but it works.

106
00:08:54,680 --> 00:08:58,960
But what good.
 Then we can stop showing the charts.

107
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:03,720
Then we will skip some pictures.
 That was the question.

108
00:09:03,800 --> 00:09:08,160
Then we arrive at this.

109
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:11,040
I thought.
 Now.

110
00:09:13,640 --> 00:09:17,040
After all, it's not just a bill that comes.

111
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:20,600
I don't know if you heard when I talked to Willy.
 He asked:

112
00:09:20,680 --> 00:09:25,640
"Does it have significance? Does it become revolving for the crime prevention work"-

113
00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:29,680
-"That a bill was produced?"
 I answered yes.

114
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:35,800
Then I thought I should have explained a bit.

115
00:09:35,880 --> 00:09:39,480
With this bill-

116
00:09:39,560 --> 00:09:43,720
-Have the search lamp aimed at the municipalities.

117
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:47,840
In 2021, when I looked at national initiatives that have taken-

118
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:52,880
-Holds the municipalities in a completely different way in these SOU: erna-

119
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:57,440
-or reports from authorities or the authorities' own writing-

120
00:09:57,520 --> 00:10:01,000
-What the municipalities could do to prevent crime.

121
00:10:01,080 --> 00:10:05,360
There are expectations that the municipality will now prevent ...

122
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:10,280
In addition to creating the organizational structure, and work systematically-

123
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:14,080
-There are expectations for the municipality to work with environmental crime-

124
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:17,960
-Now the municipality will take hold of the violence workers in violence in close relationships-

125
00:10:18,040 --> 00:10:24,160
-And make efforts against financial crime and gang crime.

126
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:30,800
There is something more, not just a bill.

127
00:10:35,520 --> 00:10:38,680
Do you have any thoughts?
 Have you noticed it?

128
00:10:38,760 --> 00:10:42,440
It is clear that a legislative-

129
00:10:42,520 --> 00:10:48,000
-Shid if you need to change your work a lot, it means a lot.

130
00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:54,640
Brå, Skr and the police have for many years supported the collaboration between the police and the municipal

131
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:58,440
-And develop the crime prevention work locally.

132
00:10:58,520 --> 00:11:02,240
The state has not supported it as much as the state does now.

133
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:07,360
There was a long period where the state's only driving force was-

134
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:12,560
-To improve the political result, not the municipalities' crime prevention work.

135
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:15,520
It has turned in recent years.

136
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:19,920
Now the state thinks that the municipalities must get on the track.

137
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:25,200
The municipalities play an important role.
 The municipality must help the police.

138
00:11:25,280 --> 00:11:31,160
From the time we have been working on the issue for many years, the state is now a player-

139
00:11:31,240 --> 00:11:37,440
-As is trying to drive this development forward.
 A change from a political perspective.

140
00:11:37,520 --> 00:11:44,000
How do you think from Skr?
 There is an increased demand for the municipalities that are sneakily on here.

141
00:11:44,080 --> 00:11:50,000
You who have read our referral response understand that we do not like the legislation.

142
00:11:50,080 --> 00:11:55,320
The municipalities can develop their crime prevention work without legislation.

143
00:11:55,400 --> 00:12:01,000
The support that Brå and also the county administrative boards and the police provide to the municipalities-

144
00:12:01,080 --> 00:12:06,280
-would be able to develop.
 So you can develop the crime prevention work.

145
00:12:06,360 --> 00:12:09,440
We have been negative to a legislation-

146
00:12:09,520 --> 00:12:14,040
-But it is because we do not like the state controlling the municipalities.

147
00:12:14,120 --> 00:12:17,480
It is more of such a aspect that we put in it.

148
00:12:17,560 --> 00:12:21,160
Now we understand that we do not escape legislation.

149
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:27,360
Then it is more about how the state actors should support the municipalities-

150
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:30,720
-And what money will we get for this?

151
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:36,040
These are the issues we are now running.
 From a crime prevention perspective-

152
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:41,200
-Can it have an effect, and you can get a mandate for the questions in a different way.

153
00:12:41,280 --> 00:12:45,200
The municipalities are obliged to work with this.

154
00:12:45,280 --> 00:12:51,200
Do you see it from a political, organizational or crime prevention perspective?

155
00:12:51,280 --> 00:12:56,440
There are different aspects of how to look at this question.

156
00:12:56,520 --> 00:13:00,520
-See you.
 -From the part of the Police Authority ...

157
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:04,000
... we welcome this legislation very-

158
00:13:04,080 --> 00:13:09,000
-And looks forward to having expectations of the municipalities based on this.

159
00:13:09,080 --> 00:13:14,880
Of course, there are a lot of municipalities in the country that are further forward-

160
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:21,560
-An the minimum level of legislation, prescribes.

161
00:13:21,640 --> 00:13:28,600
But to get up the minimum level, the low level, get a standard-

162
00:13:28,680 --> 00:13:34,320
-Th what each municipality should be able to do in this crime prevention work-

163
00:13:34,400 --> 00:13:38,600
-We will decorate from the Police Authority is good.

164
00:13:38,680 --> 00:13:43,480
We have a challenge on the part of the Police Authority.
 We are now an authority.

165
00:13:43,560 --> 00:13:49,760
We have an assignment to work in a uniform and similar way throughout the country-

166
00:13:49,840 --> 00:13:56,640
-And so we have 297 different municipalities that that uniform will meet.

167
00:13:56,720 --> 00:14:00,760
Therefore, we believe and hope that this legislation will help to-

168
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:06,000
-When it applies to structures, working methods, working method-

169
00:14:06,080 --> 00:14:09,440
-When we then have in the crime prevention work-

170
00:14:09,520 --> 00:14:14,400
-That we get it as uniform as possible in the country-

171
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:21,400
-and thus generates efficiency gains and has power and effects due to it-

172
00:14:21,480 --> 00:14:27,000
-In the crime prevention work.
 It is a line we will try to drive.

173
00:14:27,080 --> 00:14:33,120
Getting this as uniform as possible.
 That we work in the same way in the country.

174
00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:38,560
I think we have to safeguard municipal self -government.

175
00:14:38,640 --> 00:14:45,480
We develop the crime prevention work by based on local conditions.

176
00:14:46,680 --> 00:14:52,200
Speaking of local conditions, we have received a question where one wonders-

177
00:14:52,280 --> 00:14:57,120
-If we can explain more what we mean by knowledge -based.

178
00:14:57,200 --> 00:15:04,160
We say the situation that includes survey, causal analysis.

179
00:15:05,520 --> 00:15:10,120
"Have you had thoughts about the situation image as a basis for priorities"-

180
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:15,360
-"Out of what should be included? Is it a difference it would be good to have it explained."

181
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:20,320
From how we previously talked about situation pictures and what is in the legislation.

182
00:15:20,400 --> 00:15:25,840
If there is a difference.
 There is someone who says: "Good, Greta."

183
00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:30,800
I'm just trying to be your speech tube.

184
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:37,840
-Do you want to answer the question?
 -It's clear you should check the difficult.

185
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:43,240
Actually, there is not much difference to what is in the law text.

186
00:15:43,320 --> 00:15:49,000
We have said that a situation picture should contain a survey and an analysis.

187
00:15:49,080 --> 00:15:55,600
Then we have not quite as clearly talked about inventing their conditions-

188
00:15:55,680 --> 00:16:00,600
-Working crime prevention.
 I don't know if you can see the spin in front of you.

189
00:16:00,680 --> 00:16:03,880
That it says "initiate collaboration" at the top.

190
00:16:03,960 --> 00:16:08,840
But one has to identify what it looks like organizationally to us.

191
00:16:08,920 --> 00:16:13,720
What are we doing now?
 What kind of structures do we have?
 What can we use?

192
00:16:13,800 --> 00:16:18,120
How can it flow into the work?
 The difference is well-

193
00:16:18,200 --> 00:16:22,800
-That is now the case more clearly into this situation.

194
00:16:25,080 --> 00:16:28,080
-Håkan.
 -I might misunderstand the question ...

195
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:32,560
... but of course situation pictures must be based on the local problem picture.

196
00:16:32,640 --> 00:16:37,080
Is it the local problem picture that is the problems to address?

197
00:16:37,160 --> 00:16:41,920
But what I believe and even claim to know, that's Ju-

198
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:46,800
-That many situation pictures may not be complete.

199
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:50,920
You look where you stand, if I say so-

200
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:56,040
-But there is a lot of information about the development of crime-

201
00:16:56,120 --> 00:17:02,760
-If even system threatening activities that are going on in the country-

202
00:17:02,840 --> 00:17:06,280
-which may need to get into position pictures at local level-

203
00:17:06,360 --> 00:17:11,000
-To create an awareness that these problems exist in society.

204
00:17:11,080 --> 00:17:15,400
This organized crime operates in the country-

205
00:17:15,480 --> 00:17:20,040
-and we may see it not here and now, but it may come next week-

206
00:17:20,120 --> 00:17:26,080
-by a hostile takeover of a business, a restaurant-

207
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:31,400
-A municipal company, for example.
 You have to be prepared for that.

208
00:17:31,480 --> 00:17:37,080
You have to bring that in this.
 It may not require an action here and now-

209
00:17:37,160 --> 00:17:40,960
-But all local position images need to be refined-

210
00:17:41,040 --> 00:17:47,760
-with the information that one is necessarily not sitting with local-

211
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:52,680
-But that now still becomes clear that it must be added to these position images-

212
00:17:52,760 --> 00:17:57,000
-When it gets a structure in this way that you get through legislation.

213
00:17:57,080 --> 00:18:03,280
Among other things, it is the role of the Police Authority to be able to provide for these position images-

214
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:08,120
-With such information, and I think that is important.

215
00:18:08,200 --> 00:18:14,720
I believe that if we get this base-

216
00:18:14,800 --> 00:18:21,000
-when the legislation approaches, then the idea is that the work we put there-

217
00:18:21,080 --> 00:18:27,480
-Do lead to something better than what we have done before, to the right action.

218
00:18:27,560 --> 00:18:31,400
That is the very purpose of this.
 The purpose is not collaboration-

219
00:18:31,480 --> 00:18:38,240
-The position pictures or mapping.
 The purpose is to get one step further through the tools.

220
00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:43,000
It takes time.
 Many of us here in the room have been doing this for years.

221
00:18:43,080 --> 00:18:48,800
My hope is that we will be able to take the step and get a little better.

222
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:54,200
Get a little sharper, put in a little better action against what is actually the problem.

223
00:18:54,280 --> 00:18:59,120
The collaboration for the sake of collaboration is meaningless.

224
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:04,400
We must never forget why we do this.
 Not to get the complete position image-

225
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:08,080
-It is for us to be able to take the right measures.

226
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:11,360
Cooperation is required, it requires thoughtful work.

227
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:16,040
This base should lay the foundation so that we can take a step forward-

228
00:19:16,120 --> 00:19:20,800
-So that we can see results.
 And we have seen the results of our actions.

229
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:26,400
This is what is so important and good, to build the crime prevention work on.

230
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:31,440
That is what we must keep in mind when we read the law's proposal.

231
00:19:31,520 --> 00:19:35,720
We should not meet these base stuff, and lean back.

232
00:19:35,800 --> 00:19:42,520
They will lead to something that makes us safer and safer municipalities.

233
00:19:42,600 --> 00:19:49,400
What Håkan talks about recognizes to where you started, Lotta.

234
00:19:50,800 --> 00:19:56,320
Within the county administrative boards, we also see this complexity and width-

235
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:59,800
-A of the crime prevention work.

236
00:19:59,880 --> 00:20:06,840
We see how other types of crime categories are starting to become more and more interesting-

237
00:20:06,920 --> 00:20:09,240
-At national level.

238
00:20:09,320 --> 00:20:14,880
It is about environmental crime, it is about men's violence against women, the business issue.

239
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:20,000
Very interesting in relation to the crime prevention work-

240
00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:26,920
-But also violation of welfare.
 This clarifies the complexity-

241
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:33,040
-In the crime prevention work.
 The new bill presses a little neighbor.

242
00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:39,480
Where you really show the importance of the entire municipality working crime prevention.

243
00:20:39,560 --> 00:20:44,400
Many administrations have to enter this work and can contribute in a good way.

244
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:47,800
Both in a mode of image work-

245
00:20:47,880 --> 00:20:52,840
-But also linked to solving the crime problems.

246
00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:59,720
Cause analysis means to dive deep into a problem.

247
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:03,320
How can it be part of a situation picture?

248
00:21:03,400 --> 00:21:08,320
I would like to say that a situation can ...

249
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:12,080
The survey will cover everything you have found.

250
00:21:12,160 --> 00:21:17,080
But in the situation picture you also try to identify more as pattern-

251
00:21:17,160 --> 00:21:20,480
-and make a compilation of their survey.

252
00:21:20,560 --> 00:21:24,280
This means that you can prioritize certain crimes.

253
00:21:24,360 --> 00:21:28,400
"This is what we want to know more about and do causal analysis about."

254
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:31,680
We do not say that one should do a causal analysis of all-

255
00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:36,440
-An if you can report a survey that has covered a lot.

256
00:21:36,520 --> 00:21:42,440
In this way, I think that the causal analysis will be included in the position image.

257
00:21:42,520 --> 00:21:46,880
I hope I do not say to what we have written in the book.

258
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:53,120
Based on the situation, it is assumed that the collaborative parties-

259
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:58,200
-which is identified in this legislation, make its prioritization first-

260
00:21:58,280 --> 00:22:03,120
-When which are our most important problems we see?

261
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:08,880
This is where the causal analysis comes in to go into depth in those problems.

262
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:14,320
You got for something you said before: "Good, Håkan!"

263
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:16,840
Great.
 1-1.

264
00:22:19,560 --> 00:22:24,000
We get quite a few questions about this with the situation picture.

265
00:22:24,080 --> 00:22:28,000
There we begin to understand that here there is a need of

266
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:31,400
-Do we continue to provide support and discuss-

267
00:22:31,480 --> 00:22:37,480
-What is for expectations that come with this situation picture?

268
00:22:37,560 --> 00:22:41,320
As the bill looks like now, it may change-

269
00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:45,320
-Then there is nothing to say what the situation picture should look like.

270
00:22:45,400 --> 00:22:51,000
You should make as good a picture as you can, of course-

271
00:22:51,080 --> 00:22:56,840
-But the important thing is that one does not get stuck in the mapping bit-

272
00:22:56,920 --> 00:23:00,680
-That you don't get stuck in it.
 You should make a good situation.

273
00:23:00,760 --> 00:23:05,800
The situation picture can be improved, you can improve that year by year.

274
00:23:05,880 --> 00:23:10,200
The law does not require the situation to look in a special way-

275
00:23:10,280 --> 00:23:16,400
-What is the situation picture that the municipality pleases to develop, which is in demand.

276
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:22,040
Not everyone can make a situation that is 100 percent right from the start.

277
00:23:22,120 --> 00:23:25,800
No municipality has ever done so.
 You start at some end.

278
00:23:25,880 --> 00:23:31,560
You who have made the situation know that you can replenish and adjust it, and move on.

279
00:23:31,640 --> 00:23:38,080
You who start from scratch, there is good support in our collaboration book.

280
00:23:38,160 --> 00:23:44,240
There is no minimum limit for what a position picture should look like.

281
00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:47,320
It is probably a co -condition, maybe.

282
00:23:47,400 --> 00:23:50,000
Several of you have asked questions-

283
00:23:50,080 --> 00:23:55,440
-If what to do with municipalities that do not prioritize crime prevention work?

284
00:23:55,520 --> 00:23:59,000
Isn't that the purpose of the law?

285
00:23:59,080 --> 00:24:03,160
Do you mean how to take them in the ear from the state?

286
00:24:03,240 --> 00:24:08,520
Yes.
 "What could be the consequences for municipalities that do not comply with the law?"

287
00:24:08,600 --> 00:24:13,560
The first question that came in, before the session was even in the walk-

288
00:24:13,640 --> 00:24:18,200
-Also traded on what happens to a municipality that does not follow the law?

289
00:24:18,280 --> 00:24:22,640
Do you want me to answer that?
 Or maybe the state should do?

290
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:28,600
And then you look at me?
 I can say this.

291
00:24:28,680 --> 00:24:34,800
BRÅ has a responsibility to follow up on how this law works

292
00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:39,360
-And how the municipalities work according to it.
 We will follow up on it-

293
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:44,000
-And I suspect it will be like the annual report we do today.

294
00:24:44,080 --> 00:24:50,400
It may be a bit like open comparisons, which Skr develops.

295
00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:54,000
That you describe how the municipalities work.

296
00:24:54,080 --> 00:24:58,800
But we have no sanctioning authority.
 We are not such an authority.

297
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:02,080
We will only compile this.

298
00:25:02,160 --> 00:25:09,000
There is no sanction, and it thinks that Skr is good.

299
00:25:09,080 --> 00:25:14,440
We also do not think that the state should control exactly what the municipality does-

300
00:25:14,520 --> 00:25:17,440
-Or I think the municipalities want to do right.

301
00:25:17,520 --> 00:25:21,880
The municipalities want to work as well as they can in the crime prevention work.

302
00:25:21,960 --> 00:25:24,560
Then these must be anchored from above.

303
00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:28,000
Some may have views that the municipal management does not prioritize.

304
00:25:28,080 --> 00:25:34,080
It is legislation.
 The municipalities are obliged to follow the law, and want to do so.

305
00:25:34,160 --> 00:25:38,000
No one will hit you on your fingers if you do wrong-

306
00:25:38,080 --> 00:25:43,680
-But the hope is that everyone has the ambition to follow the law.

307
00:25:44,680 --> 00:25:49,960
We all want our citizens to be as good as possible-

308
00:25:50,040 --> 00:25:52,280
-And wants to prevent crime.

309
00:25:52,360 --> 00:25:56,360
It will be self-marking if one does not follow the law-

310
00:25:56,440 --> 00:26:03,040
-So I see that the law itself will be self -realization.

311
00:26:03,120 --> 00:26:07,120
You do not want to be designated as the one who does not.

312
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:12,680
Not MD the priority that the security and security issues have in the municipalities.

313
00:26:12,760 --> 00:26:19,720
Fifteen years ago, these issues were not on the agenda as they are today.

314
00:26:19,800 --> 00:26:22,800
Now almost all municipalities talk about this.

315
00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:29,680
Then you prioritize it differently, depending on what the crime looks like in the municipality.

316
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:33,120
It will be a cue in to the next question.

317
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:40,160
We have received a question.
 It is in itself good with national unity and structure-

318
00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:46,000
-But are there any thoughts with us about how to support the smaller municipalities?

319
00:26:46,080 --> 00:26:51,440
They often have small resources and limited presence of police.

320
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:57,360
In the bill, the county administrative boards also have ...

321
00:26:57,440 --> 00:27:04,120
It states that we must be allocated funds to provide operational support to municipalities-

322
00:27:04,200 --> 00:27:08,720
-To reach the requirements of the legislation.

323
00:27:08,800 --> 00:27:13,400
It is a clear signal to us based on how we have interpreted it.

324
00:27:13,480 --> 00:27:20,440
It is the municipalities that may struggle with resources and with these processes-

325
00:27:20,520 --> 00:27:26,680
-And this is where we should receive a resource strengthening to be able to be a support.

326
00:27:26,760 --> 00:27:30,800
What that support might look like, it will look different out-

327
00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:33,920
-Sters, we are 21 different authorities.

328
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:38,120
We adapt our support to the needs of the local level-

329
00:27:38,200 --> 00:27:42,000
-But we will also return to the latter today.

330
00:27:42,080 --> 00:27:45,760
What kind of support is actually in demand.

331
00:27:45,840 --> 00:27:50,920
Then I just want to say that I would like to say-

332
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:57,000
-This small municipalities have been given a more prominent role in national conversations in the day-

333
00:27:57,080 --> 00:28:03,520
-compared to earlier.
 When I look at referrals and referral responses-

334
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:09,160
-When often lifted rural and sparsely populated municipalities' prerequisites-

335
00:28:09,240 --> 00:28:14,400
-Sodger than they did before.
 It is a joint work that we have done.

336
00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:19,800
We have a bit of a mission to lift all municipalities' conditions.

337
00:28:19,880 --> 00:28:24,880
We work with this on the county administrative boards, but also the police and Skr.

338
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:27,400
And BRÅ, of course.

339
00:28:27,480 --> 00:28:33,600
We cooperate a lot now, around what support the municipalities need.

340
00:28:33,680 --> 00:28:38,760
Then the focus will be on the municipalities that have not begun their crime prevention work-

341
00:28:38,840 --> 00:28:43,000
-What does not have the structure that the law requires.

342
00:28:43,080 --> 00:28:47,120
In addition to the particular level, which we realize must have a lot of support-

343
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:50,880
-How should we support other municipalities that have come further?

344
00:28:50,960 --> 00:28:56,280
After all, we will not leave you who have come a long way, to help the others.

345
00:28:56,360 --> 00:29:01,800
We want the support to be available for all different levels.
 We discuss that a lot.

346
00:29:01,880 --> 00:29:06,320
We are fully aware that there are municipalities at all levels.

347
00:29:06,400 --> 00:29:12,440
In some way, everyone must be able to develop their crime prevention work regardless of level.

348
00:29:12,520 --> 00:29:18,720
We discuss all the municipalities' different crime prevention levels-

349
00:29:18,800 --> 00:29:21,080
-When we talk support.

350
00:29:21,160 --> 00:29:25,760
There I can fill up, in the annual report I talked about earlier in day-

351
00:29:25,840 --> 00:29:27,760
-That we see a development-

352
00:29:27,840 --> 00:29:32,920
-There of metropolitan municipalities since 2017 have been high and stable.

353
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:37,280
They have fairly good conditions organizationally to work with the questions.

354
00:29:37,360 --> 00:29:43,400
They have a habit of doing mapping, causal analysis and follow -ups.

355
00:29:43,480 --> 00:29:49,680
Then we have also followed the smaller municipalities, which we will support.

356
00:29:49,760 --> 00:29:55,640
You can see that the curve is going up now.

357
00:29:55,720 --> 00:30:01,160
There are more people who have local advice.
 More who have collaboration agreements.

358
00:30:01,240 --> 00:30:07,000
Smaller municipalities may not allocate a full-time service to this question-

359
00:30:07,080 --> 00:30:10,800
-Thaly combines it with several other prevention issues.

360
00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:15,800
You may not have had a pure education for the questions either.

361
00:30:15,880 --> 00:30:20,000
Despite this, you still do surveys.
 It goes up.

362
00:30:20,080 --> 00:30:26,400
It is more causal analysis, a little weaker with follow -up, but it is a positive trend.

363
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:29,960
But you look at the medium-sized municipalities-

364
00:30:30,040 --> 00:30:35,000
-When we barely talk about, but that are still quite a few in Sweden-

365
00:30:35,080 --> 00:30:39,000
-The their curve is more flat.

366
00:30:39,080 --> 00:30:45,000
In some respects, it has now begun to go down.

367
00:30:45,080 --> 00:30:49,480
When we said we need to look over all the municipalities-

368
00:30:49,560 --> 00:30:55,160
-blie the "big city, socially vulnerable areas, gang crime"--

369
00:30:55,240 --> 00:31:02,000
-Or it will be sparsely populated, and so we have lost middle milk Sweden.

370
00:31:04,360 --> 00:31:07,600
It may be coincidences that make it flicker out.

371
00:31:07,680 --> 00:31:11,800
It can be a result after the restrictions of Covid-19.

372
00:31:11,880 --> 00:31:17,960
But we have to keep extra eyes to the medium -sized municipalities.

373
00:31:19,080 --> 00:31:25,120
The county administrative boards' regional crime prevention coordinator-

374
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:28,000
-Find out throughout the country.

375
00:31:28,080 --> 00:31:33,000
We adapt our work based on the needs that exist in our county.

376
00:31:33,080 --> 00:31:39,400
That communication is important.
 Contact the coordinator on the county administrative board.

377
00:31:39,480 --> 00:31:45,000
Have a dialogue about what support you want, what support the county administrative board can provide.

378
00:31:45,080 --> 00:31:50,080
It is also a way for us that, just as Lotta talked about earlier in day-

379
00:31:50,160 --> 00:31:54,280
-Being able to bring up the local level on a national level.

380
00:31:54,360 --> 00:31:59,080
Then we have to get it to us in order to pass it on.

381
00:31:59,160 --> 00:32:02,800
Don't be afraid to contact.

382
00:32:09,880 --> 00:32:16,240
I was going to say that there will be no more questions, but then one came just.

383
00:32:16,320 --> 00:32:21,960
If the prerequisite is that the municipality must sign a cooperation agreement-

384
00:32:22,040 --> 00:32:26,440
-What happens if the municipality is not satisfied with what the police can put up with?

385
00:32:26,520 --> 00:32:31,040
Do we force the municipalities to sign anyway?

386
00:32:32,120 --> 00:32:38,360
An agreement is a form of will.

387
00:32:38,440 --> 00:32:45,400
That you put down on print, black on white, what you want to achieve together.

388
00:32:45,480 --> 00:32:49,360
An agreement is an agreement.

389
00:32:49,440 --> 00:32:55,480
If you are not satisfied, then you cannot sign such an agreement.

390
00:32:55,560 --> 00:33:02,200
Then there is the legal requirement that there should be a collaboration agreement, but ...

391
00:33:02,280 --> 00:33:06,200
You cannot sign an agreement if you are not satisfied.

392
00:33:06,280 --> 00:33:09,760
No, exactly.
 This is a collaboration-

393
00:33:09,840 --> 00:33:14,160
-Which is to be based on agreeing on what to work with.

394
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:16,240
Then you have to file on ...

395
00:33:16,320 --> 00:33:23,280
After all, there are municipalities that do not want to be part of the citizen promises-

396
00:33:23,360 --> 00:33:27,880
-like the police.
 Municipalities have broken the cooperation agreement-

397
00:33:27,960 --> 00:33:31,560
-To you are dissatisfied with the police's representation.

398
00:33:31,640 --> 00:33:36,720
Then you have to try to find ... The very basis of the agreement-

399
00:33:36,800 --> 00:33:40,480
-Is, as Charlotta says, a kind of will.

400
00:33:40,560 --> 00:33:44,480
If one cannot agree on one point, it cannot be included in the agreement.

401
00:33:44,560 --> 00:33:48,240
If one is dissatisfied with the police presence-

402
00:33:48,320 --> 00:33:52,920
-Do not regulate the agreement.

403
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:59,440
What we can do better together in this work, we will work with that.

404
00:33:59,520 --> 00:34:05,360
Hopefully, in a collaboration, one can agree-

405
00:34:05,440 --> 00:34:08,760
-What to be included in the agreement, and not.

406
00:34:08,840 --> 00:34:12,400
If you cannot agree on a particular issue, you should not bring it.

407
00:34:12,480 --> 00:34:17,520
Neither the municipality nor the police can force the other to sign an agreement.

408
00:34:17,600 --> 00:34:21,760
But the agreement is not a legally binding document.

409
00:34:21,840 --> 00:34:24,200
No one can go to court and say:

410
00:34:24,280 --> 00:34:30,800
"Now the police broke the agreement."
 This is a will.

411
00:34:30,880 --> 00:34:35,000
The requirements of the law are not so that you should ...

412
00:34:35,080 --> 00:34:40,480
It says that you should document this in a way and you should agree.

413
00:34:40,560 --> 00:34:47,400
The important thing is to have this collaboration and that you try to move on.

414
00:34:47,480 --> 00:34:54,320
Then you have to take a new hold the next time you negotiate or sit down and plan.

415
00:34:54,400 --> 00:35:00,720
Hopefully it is not a document that you hit the other in your head.

416
00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:06,800
It should be a common will, which controls the work forward.

417
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:09,440
We should be a little better together.

418
00:35:09,520 --> 00:35:15,360
It should not be a bat, a threat or a bribe.
 That is not the purpose.

419
00:35:15,440 --> 00:35:21,440
The purpose is for us to get better.
 That the municipality and police find the right measures.

420
00:35:21,520 --> 00:35:27,640
The police will take into account the municipality's picture of reality and vice versa.

421
00:35:27,720 --> 00:35:31,920
It's a hard question-

422
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:37,440
-But the very purpose is not to have it as a bat.

423
00:35:37,520 --> 00:35:41,400
We can't force anyone else, simply.

424
00:35:41,480 --> 00:35:46,120
Before I give you the word I want to say, good Malin!

425
00:35:46,200 --> 00:35:51,000
-1-1.
 -Now it's me zeroing.

426
00:35:51,080 --> 00:35:57,520
"Do you do the homework according to the book 'Collaboration in local crime prevention work'"-

427
00:35:57,600 --> 00:36:03,400
-Harms the agreement at the level that both parties have the opportunity to work with.

428
00:36:03,480 --> 00:36:07,720
-Do you say that?
 -It was a good answer that came in there.

429
00:36:07,800 --> 00:36:13,320
I have nothing to add linked to the collaboration agreement.

430
00:36:13,400 --> 00:36:18,160
You should be able to agree on that.
 These are the issues that are there.

431
00:36:18,240 --> 00:36:21,040
My picture is, and we look over ...

432
00:36:21,120 --> 00:36:26,080
In any case within the Police Authority, we peek over at regular intervals-

433
00:36:26,160 --> 00:36:32,200
-All collaboration agreements that the police do with the municipalities.

434
00:36:32,280 --> 00:36:34,960
The ones we get in and the ones we get access to.

435
00:36:35,040 --> 00:36:40,040
My picture is that there are other things that make you not agree-

436
00:36:40,120 --> 00:36:42,800
-If a cooperation agreement-

437
00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:48,280
-But that is what becomes the symbol because you do not have good cooperation.

438
00:36:48,360 --> 00:36:53,520
One has incorrect or unreasonable expectations of each other-

439
00:36:53,600 --> 00:36:59,800
-And so the collaboration agreement becomes the symbol.
 Then do not sign it.

440
00:36:59,880 --> 00:37:06,720
I meet municipalities and police.
 Many municipalities are dissatisfied with the police-

441
00:37:06,800 --> 00:37:11,480
-But also many police officers who are dissatisfied with the municipality.

442
00:37:11,560 --> 00:37:16,800
It looks very different, who is drawing in this work.

443
00:37:16,880 --> 00:37:18,840
What becomes more equal is-

444
00:37:18,920 --> 00:37:24,720
-This is that both the police and the municipality have a crime prevention assignment by law.

445
00:37:24,800 --> 00:37:29,040
That's the difference now.
 Previously, the police have had the mission-

446
00:37:29,120 --> 00:37:36,080
-And the municipalities have been involved to the extent that they want or need.

447
00:37:36,160 --> 00:37:40,080
Now it becomes a kind of minimum requirement.
 Both have the assignment.

448
00:37:40,160 --> 00:37:46,920
It may be able to help us get this balance that both parties weigh just as heavily.

449
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:53,640
It is very important in collaboration, that it is not the one or the other who has the power.

450
00:37:53,720 --> 00:37:57,040
The police should not dictate the conditions for the municipality.

451
00:37:57,120 --> 00:38:04,040
There are two equivalent parties who will agree and work towards a common goal.

452
00:38:05,160 --> 00:38:08,720
Now that we talk more about the police-

453
00:38:08,800 --> 00:38:13,160
—inst minded going over and talking about what expectations the law can bring-

454
00:38:13,240 --> 00:38:17,040
-On the police and in the local police areas.

455
00:38:17,120 --> 00:38:20,160
A bit like we mentioned earlier today ...

456
00:38:20,240 --> 00:38:22,680
Both Ulf and I were in on-

457
00:38:22,760 --> 00:38:27,920
-That the municipalities often turn to the police for support and help.

458
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:34,480
With increased pressure and ambition increase with the crime prevention work-

459
00:38:34,560 --> 00:38:39,880
-Alt the local police area also to have to meet it, just as you said:

460
00:38:39,960 --> 00:38:42,360
"You are equal parties."

461
00:38:45,160 --> 00:38:48,360
-I can begin.
 -Yes, please start.

462
00:38:48,440 --> 00:38:54,080
It is probably a concern that Skr lifted in the investigation work, and by the municipality-

463
00:38:54,160 --> 00:38:57,440
-That you are afraid that the police will take a step back:

464
00:38:57,520 --> 00:39:01,920
"Now the municipalities have been given responsibility for the crime prevention work."

465
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:06,560
"Now we can keep up with cool operational efforts."

466
00:39:06,640 --> 00:39:12,400
It is probably a concern that we have had.
 - You may want to hook in. What do you think?

467
00:39:12,480 --> 00:39:15,440
You can believe that I want to.

468
00:39:15,520 --> 00:39:20,120
-The fears are true ... -not, you think.

469
00:39:20,200 --> 00:39:27,160
No.
 Of course, there may be individuals in this where it is not matched-

470
00:39:27,240 --> 00:39:34,200
-But I think it was clearly stated in what Ulf Johansson told about earlier.

471
00:39:34,280 --> 00:39:40,320
We within the Police Authority, although it takes a long time to build up-

472
00:39:40,400 --> 00:39:44,920
-So we have made a very powerful promotion since 2015

473
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:48,800
-As the crime prevention work within the Police Authority-

474
00:39:48,880 --> 00:39:53,000
-and now where we are today, this is-

475
00:39:53,080 --> 00:39:57,480
-If not the heaviest, so at least at least as heavy-

476
00:39:57,560 --> 00:40:03,720
-As other important strategic orientations of police work.

477
00:40:03,800 --> 00:40:10,000
I dare to promise that the police are ready and will not back away-

478
00:40:10,080 --> 00:40:16,600
-When the municipalities are given this responsibility.
 On the contrary, it is long-awaited-

479
00:40:16,680 --> 00:40:20,120
-Just to get that equal party.

480
00:40:20,200 --> 00:40:25,680
As you said, Greta, we have had municipal police officers since 2015-

481
00:40:25,760 --> 00:40:29,800
-For all municipalities.
 That activity is there many regions-

482
00:40:29,880 --> 00:40:36,120
— as now also in conjunction with growth, which was told about earlier in the day-

483
00:40:36,200 --> 00:40:39,800
-Will expand, so we really ensure-

484
00:40:39,880 --> 00:40:45,040
-That it is not a municipal police officer who is responsible for four or five municipalities.

485
00:40:45,120 --> 00:40:50,960
There is a municipal police officer at each municipality.
 Then we also want a co-part-

486
00:40:51,040 --> 00:40:56,720
-On the municipality's side, which is a clear entrance.
 It is missing in many municipalities.

487
00:40:56,800 --> 00:41:01,800
Where the municipal police can run around to a lot of administrations-

488
00:41:01,880 --> 00:41:05,120
-For the questions are not coordinated in any way.

489
00:41:05,200 --> 00:41:09,640
You cannot turn to a place and have an entrance into the municipality.

490
00:41:09,720 --> 00:41:16,080
So it's longed for this.
 We promise that we will stand up for.

491
00:41:16,160 --> 00:41:19,360
-Bra, Håkan.
 -Yes.
 Good, Håkan.

492
00:41:19,440 --> 00:41:25,200
All you municipalities that have received these indications, this is a fellow

493
00:41:25,280 --> 00:41:30,600
-That police legislation does not change.
 They are responsible for this question-

494
00:41:30,680 --> 00:41:33,880
-No like we will get it in the municipality.

495
00:41:33,960 --> 00:41:38,520
You have to take it into consideration, and then you have to have Håkan's words in the back-

496
00:41:38,600 --> 00:41:44,440
-That it's a joint job.
 The police should not reverse, but take a step forward.

497
00:41:44,520 --> 00:41:49,520
There you have to be a little responsive to the way the situation looks out-

498
00:41:49,600 --> 00:41:55,720
-And you get to talk to your police locally, and what you have expectations.

499
00:41:55,800 --> 00:42:02,000
We have talked a lot on the county administrative boards.
 What we get from the municipalities-

500
00:42:02,080 --> 00:42:07,120
-The coupled to the police, is very much about ...

501
00:42:07,200 --> 00:42:11,840
We believe that there will be greater demands on collaboration with the police.

502
00:42:11,920 --> 00:42:16,720
The municipalities will demand it, more will demand it.

503
00:42:16,800 --> 00:42:23,120
Part of it will be about the statistics, getting statistics from the police.

504
00:42:23,200 --> 00:42:28,200
That police officers should feel comfortable with what statistics they can disclose.

505
00:42:28,280 --> 00:42:34,280
It is a dialogue we have had long before this bill came too.

506
00:42:34,360 --> 00:42:38,640
There, the police are very clear about "that we should get it".

507
00:42:38,720 --> 00:42:42,120
There should be a clarity around it.

508
00:42:42,200 --> 00:42:47,560
Then we also see the importance of the police presence-

509
00:42:47,640 --> 00:42:52,920
-No obviously both in socially vulnerable areas, but also on land- and sparsely populated

510
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:55,600
-Just to get this continuity-

511
00:42:55,680 --> 00:43:00,000
-In contact with police officers who will work more strategically.

512
00:43:00,080 --> 00:43:07,000
We have municipalities that describe that they have relay police, just like relay doctors.

513
00:43:07,080 --> 00:43:12,680
You get placed there for a while.
 Then there will be a new one.

514
00:43:12,760 --> 00:43:16,000
It will be so difficult to constantly start in this.

515
00:43:16,080 --> 00:43:21,800
With future legislation, we believe that this will be important for the municipalities-

516
00:43:21,880 --> 00:43:27,280
-To get continuity in it, so it's great to hear what you say.

517
00:43:27,360 --> 00:43:32,080
In terms of growth and police presence out-

518
00:43:32,160 --> 00:43:38,360
-If mind in memory that it is only at the turn of the year that we have just passed-

519
00:43:38,440 --> 00:43:41,880
-which it is really the net supplement-

520
00:43:41,960 --> 00:43:48,920
-When the police were promised a number of years ago and really got ...

521
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:53,000
It is only now that it has generated in real police officers.

522
00:43:53,080 --> 00:43:58,400
Recruitment and then 2.5 years of training before the police officers are in place.

523
00:43:58,480 --> 00:44:03,000
It is only now and in the coming years that we will see this growth.

524
00:44:03,080 --> 00:44:07,440
If you say "we haven't seen it yet", no, you haven't been able to do it-

525
00:44:07,520 --> 00:44:14,120
-For they can only be retrieved from a recruitment and a police training.

526
00:44:15,120 --> 00:44:20,240
There has been a question.
 Can you explain what Ulf meant when he said:

527
00:44:20,320 --> 00:44:26,680
"The police should focus on situational crime prevention."
 What does that mean?

528
00:44:26,760 --> 00:44:30,760
Social prevention against individual-

529
00:44:30,840 --> 00:44:36,800
-Situated prevention against location or problem, to simplify it.

530
00:44:36,880 --> 00:44:41,880
It is other actors in society that have real tools-

531
00:44:41,960 --> 00:44:45,320
-To working with prevention against individuals.

532
00:44:45,400 --> 00:44:50,320
It is the municipalities, not least within the social services, within the school-

533
00:44:50,400 --> 00:44:56,360
-But it is also the health care, which is partly, it is not called county council anymore ...

534
00:44:56,440 --> 00:44:58,080
Regions.

535
00:45:00,120 --> 00:45:05,960
The police have for many years sprung a little lost in this-

536
00:45:06,040 --> 00:45:09,480
-and may have devoted a lot of resource time-

537
00:45:09,560 --> 00:45:16,520
-To social prevention on its own, but without having the real tools-

538
00:45:16,600 --> 00:45:21,480
-As is needed for it to have an effect.

539
00:45:21,560 --> 00:45:26,280
And so we have neglected to work against the situational prevention.

540
00:45:26,360 --> 00:45:30,400
It is more about a displacement in commuter movement.

541
00:45:30,480 --> 00:45:36,000
We have to do what we can actually do, and have tools for within the Police Authority-

542
00:45:36,080 --> 00:45:41,800
-In situational prevention.
 But then we will contribute to the social prevention.

543
00:45:41,880 --> 00:45:43,800
We do a lot of work there-

544
00:45:43,880 --> 00:45:49,560
-But it assumes that this is done in collaboration with other actors who are on the tools.

545
00:45:49,640 --> 00:45:56,080
The police must contribute both their knowledge, but the information we have about individuals-

546
00:45:56,160 --> 00:46:01,520
— which need different measures against them, but also help and support-

547
00:46:01,600 --> 00:46:08,000
-Excare etc., to be able to abstain from crime in the future.

548
00:46:08,080 --> 00:46:10,880
It's not about leaving an area.

549
00:46:10,960 --> 00:46:15,480
But the police's internal focus must be on:

550
00:46:15,560 --> 00:46:20,480
"What is it above all we can do on the part of the police?"

551
00:46:20,560 --> 00:46:24,320
After all, we have to spend our resource time on.

552
00:46:26,080 --> 00:46:28,560
We got a question.

553
00:46:28,640 --> 00:46:32,800
"In many local police areas, it is still the case that a lone municipal police"--

554
00:46:32,880 --> 00:46:38,080
-"Responsible for pursuing collaboration against several municipalities at the same time."

555
00:46:38,160 --> 00:46:41,800
"In some cases four to five municipalities or more."

556
00:46:41,880 --> 00:46:47,240
"Is there a need for clearer national control towards the police regions?"

557
00:46:49,760 --> 00:46:57,520
We who worked nationally had that fears and looked fairly immediately-

558
00:46:57,600 --> 00:47:02,640
-That, unfortunately, it was so in some places that ...

559
00:47:02,720 --> 00:47:06,400
It was not known from the beginning of 2015 what this role would mean.

560
00:47:06,480 --> 00:47:09,880
What will be required, so to speak?

561
00:47:09,960 --> 00:47:13,280
One was a little careful in some places to resource this-

562
00:47:13,360 --> 00:47:19,880
-With an individual for a municipality fully, one hundred percent working hours.

563
00:47:19,960 --> 00:47:27,360
I don't think it might have been absolutely necessary to have it that way.

564
00:47:27,440 --> 00:47:31,920
One hundred percent for each municipality, for that dimension is quite different in the country-

565
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:37,800
-With 297 municipalities.
 But there were several local police areas that added ...

566
00:47:37,880 --> 00:47:41,960
... Four municipal police officers in a municipality, for that municipality was so large

567
00:47:42,040 --> 00:47:46,640
-So it requires this.
 That was what I meant...

568
00:47:46,720 --> 00:47:52,960
We run the national line that in this growth work-

569
00:47:53,040 --> 00:47:56,880
-So it must be a clear assignment to the police regions-

570
00:47:56,960 --> 00:48:01,320
-As expanding the municipal police operations for now there is a legislative-

571
00:48:01,400 --> 00:48:04,880
-As will set expectations for the police.

572
00:48:04,960 --> 00:48:10,320
We cannot say that we welcomed this legislation-

573
00:48:10,400 --> 00:48:15,200
-Now the municipalities will be given a responsibility and so we will not be able to it-

574
00:48:15,280 --> 00:48:18,640
-For the municipal police have five municipalities that he will cooperate with-

575
00:48:18,720 --> 00:48:22,400
-In this structural form that the municipalities are imposed.

576
00:48:22,480 --> 00:48:30,200
Then I don't sit on it control ...

577
00:48:30,280 --> 00:48:34,600
The control mechanism to decide on this.

578
00:48:34,680 --> 00:48:39,080
It is something we communicate internally in the national operational department-

579
00:48:39,160 --> 00:48:42,880
-In the strategies that are anchored with the police regions-

580
00:48:42,960 --> 00:48:46,760
-That this we have to bet on, this we have to build out-

581
00:48:46,840 --> 00:48:51,480
-To be able to meet the expectation that is on the police.

582
00:48:51,560 --> 00:48:55,280
It became a little politician response, I felt, but ...

583
00:48:56,280 --> 00:49:01,280
I thought we were moving on.
 Do you feel ready, because now comes ...

584
00:49:01,360 --> 00:49:06,720
-Now comes the big point.
 -Now comes the big point.

585
00:49:06,800 --> 00:49:10,800
-Sorry.
 You talk, I'm quiet.
 -Am I talk?

586
00:49:10,880 --> 00:49:15,320
We asked the question: "What kind of support do you think you will need"-

587
00:49:15,400 --> 00:49:18,080
-"linked to the new legislation?"

588
00:49:18,160 --> 00:49:22,800
This is a question that we have been thinking a lot on the county administrative boards.

589
00:49:22,880 --> 00:49:29,840
Both the type of support we should be able to contribute, when the legislation is in place-

590
00:49:29,920 --> 00:49:33,360
-And even before, to be able to prepare.

591
00:49:33,440 --> 00:49:37,240
But then also, what kind of support is this, then?

592
00:49:37,320 --> 00:49:41,640
What was quite exciting to see with your answers where-

593
00:49:41,720 --> 00:49:47,640
-That that is in good agreement with what we have thought of on the county administrative board.

594
00:49:47,720 --> 00:49:51,800
Or what we think we will have to offer.

595
00:49:51,880 --> 00:49:57,800
What we could see in the answers from you was that you ask for support.

596
00:49:57,880 --> 00:50:02,200
Then it is support from three different perspectives.

597
00:50:02,280 --> 00:50:09,240
Partly support for you who work as a coordinator in the municipalities-

598
00:50:09,320 --> 00:50:15,680
-When it is very much about skills support or competence development.

599
00:50:15,760 --> 00:50:21,840
It is about support for managers to understand what this means-

600
00:50:21,920 --> 00:50:26,040
-And provide the right conditions for you who are coordinators.

601
00:50:26,120 --> 00:50:29,360
Then it is about support for politicians-

602
00:50:29,440 --> 00:50:35,280
-In the form of guidelines, education, be able to interpret the new legislation-

603
00:50:35,360 --> 00:50:40,280
-In reaching a political consensus and a willingness to decision-

604
00:50:40,360 --> 00:50:44,160
-To connected to crime prevention issues.

605
00:50:44,240 --> 00:50:47,400
There were the big features we could see-

606
00:50:47,480 --> 00:50:53,480
-In the answer that is about the type of support that may be needed.

607
00:50:53,560 --> 00:50:56,400
What do you think about it?

608
00:50:56,480 --> 00:51:02,080
It reflects the view I have received when I have talked to different municipalities.

609
00:51:02,160 --> 00:51:06,320
It is that all municipalities say they need support-

610
00:51:06,400 --> 00:51:11,120
-But it looks very different what kind of support you need.

611
00:51:11,200 --> 00:51:15,720
This is what will be the challenge for us at national level-

612
00:51:15,800 --> 00:51:19,000
-Finding the right level of support.

613
00:51:19,080 --> 00:51:24,200
I think the county administrative boards will play a big role in this.

614
00:51:24,280 --> 00:51:28,920
One municipality in one county may need one type of support, another municipality another.

615
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:34,840
Then you have to be responsive to it and adapt it to the needs that exist.

616
00:51:34,920 --> 00:51:41,440
I think there are different levels, but also in different ways at the different levels.

617
00:51:41,520 --> 00:51:48,480
Everyone does not say "we need support with mapping or training".

618
00:51:48,560 --> 00:51:51,280
It looks very different.

619
00:51:51,360 --> 00:51:54,120
The municipality's work looks very different.

620
00:51:54,200 --> 00:52:00,480
It reflects the multifaceted work that is to be based on the local problem picture.

621
00:52:00,560 --> 00:52:04,480
That it looks different, and that we work in different ways-

622
00:52:04,560 --> 00:52:11,000
-But that the common should be the structure and that we can achieve success.

623
00:52:11,080 --> 00:52:16,800
-What do you think?
 -What to detract from that need for support ...

624
00:52:16,880 --> 00:52:22,400
... as crime prevention coordinators and those who exist in day-

625
00:52:22,480 --> 00:52:29,120
-The coordination function prescribed by the legislation shall be available, need-

626
00:52:29,200 --> 00:52:35,720
-So I think the support directed at managers-

627
00:52:35,800 --> 00:52:41,760
-And against politicians will be extremely important in this context.

628
00:52:41,840 --> 00:52:46,120
And perhaps the most important thing, without detracting-

629
00:52:46,200 --> 00:52:48,800
-For knowledge, tools are needed.

630
00:52:48,880 --> 00:52:55,000
A lot is needed around the coordination work and the crime prevention functions.

631
00:52:55,080 --> 00:52:59,440
In order to unless this crime prevention liability-

632
00:52:59,520 --> 00:53:04,320
-Nore the entire municipal administration, for it must do-

633
00:53:04,400 --> 00:53:09,080
-You have to think of crime prevention no matter where you work with it.

634
00:53:09,160 --> 00:53:16,000
The kind of problem that we see more and more of, as unauthorized impact-

635
00:53:16,080 --> 00:53:20,080
-Organized crime that is trying to get in.

636
00:53:20,160 --> 00:53:25,240
Unfortunately, the municipalities are an easy business to enter-

637
00:53:25,320 --> 00:53:29,320
-For it is a breadth of activities that the municipality conducts.

638
00:53:29,400 --> 00:53:35,000
The criminal networks and organized crime try to do so.

639
00:53:35,080 --> 00:53:39,080
Then you have to have a mindset in the entire municipality.

640
00:53:39,160 --> 00:53:42,880
Therefore, it is the administrative managers, but not least the politicians-

641
00:53:42,960 --> 00:53:48,680
-which should actually distribute the money for this work.

642
00:53:48,760 --> 00:53:51,080
I think it's extremely important.

643
00:53:51,160 --> 00:53:56,800
We have seen that.
 In the municipalities where collaboration has worked really good-

644
00:53:56,880 --> 00:54:01,560
-There you usually have a management commitment and support.

645
00:54:01,640 --> 00:54:05,040
We see that in these municipalities it works very well.

646
00:54:05,120 --> 00:54:11,040
In the municipalities with a crime prevention without support from above, it works worse.

647
00:54:11,120 --> 00:54:14,440
One can be good down there, but it happens nothing-

648
00:54:14,520 --> 00:54:19,600
-For you do not get the right resources, you do not have the right interlocutor with the police.

649
00:54:19,680 --> 00:54:24,840
I think that is very important, and we have seen that in collaboration.

650
00:54:24,920 --> 00:54:28,840
Now as we look at the annual report-

651
00:54:28,920 --> 00:54:34,120
-When we did pretty simple, it's not called anymore-

652
00:54:34,200 --> 00:54:40,920
-Samvariations, and checked on the county administrative board or

653
00:54:41,000 --> 00:54:44,880
-ger municipal coordinator or municipal police support to-

654
00:54:44,960 --> 00:54:50,240
— to make a knowledge -based work or action.

655
00:54:50,320 --> 00:54:54,320
Then it will have an effect.
 In any case, there is a co -variation there.

656
00:54:54,400 --> 00:54:59,960
If you have received such support, the municipal police officers respond to a greater extent-

657
00:55:00,040 --> 00:55:05,200
-That you also do these pieces in knowledge -based work or take action.

658
00:55:05,280 --> 00:55:09,000
It feels like ... I'm drawing a wild interpretation.

659
00:55:09,080 --> 00:55:14,400
A method nerd would say that one cannot do this much interpretation-

660
00:55:14,480 --> 00:55:19,240
-But to me it sounds like we have structures-

661
00:55:19,320 --> 00:55:23,560
-To support your local crime prevention.
 They exist, as well.

662
00:55:23,640 --> 00:55:27,680
We have a tradition of working with that and we are pretty good at that.

663
00:55:27,760 --> 00:55:31,560
We need to bring politicians and managers on this-

664
00:55:31,640 --> 00:55:35,720
-and that they understand what the law will mean.

665
00:55:35,800 --> 00:55:40,480
What does it mean to give an assignment to reach to produce a position image-

666
00:55:40,560 --> 00:55:46,320
-So that they really understand what they order and allocate resources in relation to it.

667
00:55:46,400 --> 00:55:52,120
I am so a small blow to Brå now, together with the county administrative boards-

668
00:55:52,200 --> 00:55:55,000
-Vaven Skr and the police are on a corner-

669
00:55:55,080 --> 00:55:59,200
-Developing an education for managers and politicians.

670
00:55:59,280 --> 00:56:04,160
We feel that there is a strong need to clarify this.

671
00:56:04,240 --> 00:56:10,280
Someone has written in the chat and wants to tip about a course at Linnaeus University-

672
00:56:10,360 --> 00:56:14,280
-which is called "Crime prevention methods and collaboration".

673
00:56:14,360 --> 00:56:19,080
That training is open to police, municipality and county administrative boards-

674
00:56:19,160 --> 00:56:22,880
-If you want to increase your knowledge in the subject.

675
00:56:26,480 --> 00:56:33,000
-Is something more we want to say?
 -We talked a little about the compensation.

676
00:56:33,080 --> 00:56:36,680
Morgan Johansson said this is to be funded-

677
00:56:36,760 --> 00:56:41,160
-And it will be financed by 200 million.

678
00:56:41,240 --> 00:56:46,560
We have received that sum through the budget plug

679
00:56:46,640 --> 00:56:50,200
-But it looks like it is still to be distributed ...

680
00:56:50,280 --> 00:56:55,560
It should be distributed based on population in the municipalities.

681
00:56:55,640 --> 00:57:01,240
The small municipalities, according to SKR, get too little money to do the work in a good way.

682
00:57:01,320 --> 00:57:07,360
We will push this question hard against the Ministry.

683
00:57:07,440 --> 00:57:12,200
It was an area that was lifted, linked to this issue.
 Where is resources needed?

684
00:57:12,280 --> 00:57:18,160
Both in time and in money.
 Resources throughout the chain are incredibly important.

685
00:57:18,240 --> 00:57:24,120
From national to regional and late local level.
 We cannot bottlenecks in any of the levels.

686
00:57:24,200 --> 00:57:29,000
Then we will not have the effect of the new legislation.

687
00:57:29,080 --> 00:57:34,960
When we talk about resources, it becomes a transition to the next question.

688
00:57:35,040 --> 00:57:41,920
It was then the fears, due to municipal legislation.

689
00:57:43,240 --> 00:57:47,440
Just.
 There, the resource question comes again among the answers.

690
00:57:47,520 --> 00:57:52,080
There is a concern that resources will be insufficient.

691
00:57:52,160 --> 00:57:56,520
That there will be a high workload out in the municipalities-

692
00:57:56,600 --> 00:57:59,000
-To connected to the law.

693
00:57:59,080 --> 00:58:02,800
But also that this might not-

694
00:58:02,880 --> 00:58:09,240
-will create some actual difference.
 That it will look like before.

695
00:58:09,320 --> 00:58:14,920
This will be a paper product.
 There will be quantitative solutions-

696
00:58:15,000 --> 00:58:18,400
-As for some other satisfied.

697
00:58:20,240 --> 00:58:27,000
Here also comes the connection to managers and politicians.

698
00:58:27,080 --> 00:58:33,120
There is a concern that there is no knowledge at the decision-level-

699
00:58:33,200 --> 00:58:38,960
-And that it will make the work stubborn out in the municipalities.

700
00:58:41,320 --> 00:58:47,400
Many of the things come again.
 Any thoughts about it?

701
00:58:48,960 --> 00:58:54,720
Many of the fears are interesting, and you have to try to work with it.

702
00:58:54,800 --> 00:58:57,320
But I think too-

703
00:58:57,400 --> 00:59:02,040
-That most municipalities want to do right.

704
00:59:02,120 --> 00:59:05,440
I usually try to say that to the county administrative board-

705
00:59:05,520 --> 00:59:10,000
-When sometimes think the municipalities are trying to throw away.

706
00:59:10,080 --> 00:59:14,680
"The municipalities do not want to throw away. They want to do right for themselves."

707
00:59:14,760 --> 00:59:17,880
This is no exception.

708
00:59:17,960 --> 00:59:22,000
I think you will do after best

709
00:59:22,080 --> 00:59:27,000
-To work this way and work forward on this issue.

710
00:59:27,080 --> 00:59:33,880
We should not get stuck in the legislation.
 It becomes in some way like a wall.

711
00:59:33,960 --> 00:59:39,000
The idea is that we should be behind the legislation.
 Move on to work.

712
00:59:39,080 --> 00:59:46,040
Get this commitment from management and managers to be able to work better forward.

713
00:59:46,120 --> 00:59:50,720
Just not the eyes get stuck at the law, at this document-

714
00:59:50,800 --> 00:59:55,040
-So I think we can develop the crime prevention work.

715
00:59:55,120 --> 01:00:00,120
It is all of Sweden's interest, to prevent crime more effectively.

716
01:00:00,200 --> 01:00:06,520
It's not just us in this room.
 That is everyone's will.

717
01:00:06,600 --> 01:00:10,400
We have to keep it in the back of our minds all the time.

718
01:00:10,480 --> 01:00:17,920
These fears presented in a little more general perspective-

719
01:00:18,000 --> 01:00:21,240
-That it will be a paper product and nothing will happen.

720
01:00:21,320 --> 01:00:27,840
I actually don't think so, for the social discussion today about crime-

721
01:00:27,920 --> 01:00:34,160
-Is so powerful and it happens so much that I am so naive-

722
01:00:34,240 --> 01:00:38,440
-I think you want to do something about this.

723
01:00:38,520 --> 01:00:42,560
Then, on the other hand, these fears that are linked to the fact that ...

724
01:00:42,640 --> 01:00:47,520
We do not get enough resources to do what we want to do.

725
01:00:47,600 --> 01:00:52,600
They should take more seriously and that these may cost significantly more-

726
01:00:52,680 --> 01:00:55,160
-An these 200 million.

727
01:00:55,240 --> 01:01:00,720
Both in the form of support and to build up the ability on the respective municipalities

728
01:01:00,800 --> 01:01:03,400
-Where it doesn't already exist today.

729
01:01:03,480 --> 01:01:07,200
I think we have to bring with us ... If you look at how far we have come-

730
01:01:07,280 --> 01:01:11,120
-In the crime prevention work, without legislation-

731
01:01:11,200 --> 01:01:16,560
-As by having produced support and having a crime prevention counsel-

732
01:01:16,640 --> 01:01:19,480
-And how far we have come.
 Almost all municipalities in the day-

733
01:01:19,560 --> 01:01:22,920
-Have some type of cooperation supervision.
 We do some type of survey.

734
01:01:23,000 --> 01:01:27,720
We do a lot of work that is in the right path.

735
01:01:27,800 --> 01:01:32,400
We have achieved this without legislation.

736
01:01:32,480 --> 01:01:36,080
We must have that with us - that we do this.

737
01:01:36,160 --> 01:01:39,360
This is not difficulty for us, we have done this before.
 We know this.

738
01:01:39,440 --> 01:01:44,520
There is a lot of support to get and the state wants us to do this now.

739
01:01:44,600 --> 01:01:49,160
I see it as there are only opportunities ahead, to go further-

740
01:01:49,240 --> 01:01:53,920
-And develop the crime prevention work.

741
01:01:54,000 --> 01:01:58,040
It was a shame, because that was such a good entrance to the next picture.

742
01:01:58,120 --> 01:02:01,520
I have to say my own too.

743
01:02:01,600 --> 01:02:06,640
Pretty many answers were about not feeling

744
01:02:06,720 --> 01:02:11,040
-That you are fully ready, or that you think that you account-

745
01:02:11,120 --> 01:02:14,760
-Fast you are not really ready.
 It is a concern-

746
01:02:14,840 --> 01:02:20,920
-That now the legislation comes and I think my municipality is not ready.

747
01:02:21,000 --> 01:02:26,160
It might be reflected in the diagrams that we looked at earlier-

748
01:02:26,240 --> 01:02:30,240
-When you said, "I feel ready, but maybe not the municipality".

749
01:02:30,320 --> 01:02:33,360
That it was also here in the text answers.

750
01:02:33,440 --> 01:02:37,240
I agree with you, Greta, we've come a long way

751
01:02:37,320 --> 01:02:43,160
-and that we should not lose.
 We want it to develop and sharpen

752
01:02:43,240 --> 01:02:47,000
-And then it becomes so easy to get stuck in what remains.

753
01:02:47,080 --> 01:02:51,080
One must keep in mind that the law is not built-so-

754
01:02:51,160 --> 01:02:57,120
-That on July 1, 2023 we will have everything in place, but then the team starts to apply.

755
01:02:57,200 --> 01:03:01,640
This means that we have a starting distance.
 We can start our work now.

756
01:03:01,720 --> 01:03:07,040
Even though we start then, we have time to build this work.

757
01:03:07,120 --> 01:03:11,720
No one will hit us on your fingers or hang us in the square-

758
01:03:11,800 --> 01:03:15,200
-What we will have time to do this-

759
01:03:15,280 --> 01:03:20,800
-And there is support and help to be obtained, especially from the parties standing there.

760
01:03:20,880 --> 01:03:25,560
We should not be afraid of this, but see it as a carrot-

761
01:03:25,640 --> 01:03:28,760
-Being able to develop the work locally.

762
01:03:28,840 --> 01:03:33,960
You should not think about the date and feel that you do not have everything in place.

763
01:03:34,040 --> 01:03:38,600
That's not how it's intended.
 This is an indication of where we are going.

764
01:03:38,680 --> 01:03:43,800
If you have not come all the way then, I do not think it is the whole world.

765
01:03:43,880 --> 01:03:49,440
It is a work that we have to build on.
 They should be better, year by year.

766
01:03:49,520 --> 01:03:52,840
That's the idea.
 Even though the law says a certain level-

767
01:03:52,920 --> 01:03:55,440
-We can develop the work.

768
01:03:55,520 --> 01:03:58,400
-An better transition.
 -Right?

769
01:03:58,480 --> 01:04:02,080
Then we have the last question we asked in the survey:

770
01:04:02,160 --> 01:04:06,120
"What will be better thanks to the law?"

771
01:04:06,200 --> 01:04:08,120
Just.

772
01:04:08,200 --> 01:04:13,560
There I think we could see two slightly larger areas.

773
01:04:13,640 --> 01:04:19,840
Partly it is about this work with bf-

774
01:04:19,920 --> 01:04:23,800
-It will be able to take a seat in the municipality now.

775
01:04:23,880 --> 01:04:26,560
It will be a clarified responsibility.

776
01:04:26,640 --> 01:04:33,120
You believe can lead to the issue to be given priority, that it gets greater weightdd

777
01:04:33,200 --> 01:04:36,600
-And that the system is getting better.

778
01:04:36,680 --> 01:04:42,720
The second part is a bit about the craft around.

779
01:04:42,800 --> 01:04:48,720
That it will be a more municipal-wide work-

780
01:04:48,800 --> 01:04:54,000
-the horizontal perspective, as we have been inside and touched and talked about-

781
01:04:54,080 --> 01:04:56,720
-As also came here in the chat.

782
01:04:56,800 --> 01:05:02,280
That it is important that support, not only to the manager, but far out in the line as well.

783
01:05:02,360 --> 01:05:09,040
It is something that we think will be important to support-

784
01:05:09,120 --> 01:05:14,520
-Many different administrations in the municipalities because it is so clearly printed-

785
01:05:14,600 --> 01:05:19,520
-That internal collaboration should be available.
 Everyone should contribute to work-

786
01:05:19,600 --> 01:05:24,280
-The precise as it says in our national crime prevention program.

787
01:05:24,360 --> 01:05:30,000
It is also very clear in your answers.
 That collaboration will be something else-

788
01:05:30,080 --> 01:05:34,800
-Exmen better, both internally and externally.

789
01:05:36,480 --> 01:05:40,800
I thought that if no questions come in now-

790
01:05:40,880 --> 01:05:45,800
-The we thought to end in the positive spirit.

791
01:05:45,880 --> 01:05:51,800
That it can get better.
 Collaboration especially, can be better.

792
01:05:55,720 --> 01:05:57,120
Yes!
