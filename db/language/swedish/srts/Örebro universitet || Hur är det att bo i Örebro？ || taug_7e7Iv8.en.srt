1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,400
- I really think I've found my home now.

2
00:00:03,400 --> 00:00:04,960
- The place to be.
 - Yes!

3
00:00:04,960 --> 00:00:12,680
It's so good!
 It is 37.5 square and I pay SEK 3,800 a month.

4
00:00:12,680 --> 00:00:16,360
- huh?
 Wait, how then?
 - Your mine!

5
00:00:16,360 --> 00:00:20,000
- Sign me up!
 - It's via Öbo!

6
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:27,400
- It went very smoothly.
 Smoother than I thought it would.

7
00:00:27,400 --> 00:00:29,040
- Nice!

8
00:00:29,040 --> 00:00:31,640
- I found one close to the university very quickly.

9
00:00:31,640 --> 00:00:37,400
Once you came here, you also found out lots of other housing queues,

10
00:00:37,400 --> 00:00:41,440
You could stand in. So pretty quickly I moved closer to town as well.

11
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:42,320
- Very Nice!

12
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:45,640
- Many who are going to move, when moving to a new city and all that,

13
00:00:45,640 --> 00:00:48,640
Feel "Will I get a home now?"
 And "How does it work?"

14
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:51,920
- It became a bit spontaneous that I ended up at Örebro University.

15
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:54,560
Then I was a little happy that I would not find any apartment,

16
00:00:54,560 --> 00:00:58,760
That I had queued too late and lots of stuff there.

17
00:00:58,760 --> 00:01:03,240
Then I found something called a housing guarantee, which Örebro offers.

18
00:01:03,240 --> 00:01:07,040
I applied for it and then I got an apartment through it.

19
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:11,280
- I went here from Stockholm and became Suphoastad.

20
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:15,680
- Lol!
 The person who would rent out the apartment did not show up.

21
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:17,600
- He didn't show up.
 - He didn't show up.

22
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:23,160
- But then I got through the housing guarantee.
 - Alright, what is the housing guarantee for something?

23
00:01:23,160 --> 00:01:29,760
- It is that the first semester that you move here from another city has guaranteed an apartment.

24
00:01:29,760 --> 00:01:32,400
- Well, but where did you have to live then?
 In any barracks or?

25
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:37,520
- No no!
 I got to live in a very nice apartment at the Central Station.

26
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:43,760
- MHM ... because when I moved here and panicked then I did not end up so well, so to speak.

27
00:01:43,760 --> 00:01:47,000
- It was actually before the admission message came, I started to check a little.

28
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:51,400
Because I understood that when the admission message comes ... - then it goes fast.

29
00:01:51,400 --> 00:02:00,160
- I looked at it and then there was a person who had put out his apartment he wanted to get rid of a little earlier.

30
00:02:00,160 --> 00:02:04,560
He wanted someone to take it over and then I wrote that I was interested in August 1st.

31
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:06,880
So that was before the semester started.

32
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:09,280
- Was it via private or Öbo?

33
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:11,600
Because I think there are different ways to get hold of an apartment?

34
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:13,240
- There are many landlords.
 - Yes!

35
00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:14,720
- This was a private landlord.

36
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:20,720
- In my opinion, it is relatively simple, compared to other cities, to get student accommodation in Örebro.

37
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:23,160
Which is not too expensive.
 It is in my opinion and my experience.

38
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:25,320
But I didn't treat it that way.

39
00:02:25,320 --> 00:02:30,400
Without it I treated it as if you get anything, you take it.

40
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:33,800
Which I did, so my first accommodation was a little less good.

41
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:38,920
But while I had it, I saw all other options and took one of them.

42
00:02:38,920 --> 00:02:39,800
- Right!

43
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:43,720
- So now I live centrally, it's newly renovated and really like it.

44
00:02:43,720 --> 00:02:46,720
- I got help from the acid a bit and lived inherent.

45
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:55,560
I think I lived for a semester so, then I moved in via Öbo and have lived in a student apartment.

46
00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:58,040
Now I live with a classmate.

47
00:02:58,040 --> 00:03:01,960
They have a lot of student apartments around the university.

48
00:03:01,960 --> 00:03:06,400
They have the ones that are double -built and are exact copies.

49
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:10,600
They have bathrooms, kitchens and two similar rooms.

50
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:12,760
For me it works very well because I like to have the company.

51
00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:16,400
- You can stand in Öbo's housing queue as well.
 - Totally free!

52
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:18,400
- Even before you start plugging, you can do it.

53
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:22,560
If you already know that you are eager to plug in Örebro, you can stand there.

54
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:26,520
- Yes, but do it.
 - So you don't end up in the situation you did.

55
00:03:26,520 --> 00:03:28,440
- Just do it, just do it.

56
00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:33,080
- I understand that you want a security once you come to the city.

57
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:37,520
I got it by buying an apartment here in Örebro.

58
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:41,320
- It's nice.
 - It was very nice!

59
00:03:41,320 --> 00:03:46,840
To me it felt like it was cheaper and the opportunity to buy was greater here,

60
00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:48,280
than for me in Stockholm.

61
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:52,080
- I like this we have on Facebook among students.

62
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:53,920
- They call us students.

63
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:59,480
- There, people usually put up apartments that they type rent out in the second place.

64
00:03:59,480 --> 00:04:01,800
Or also on which they should terminate the contract.

65
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:04,320
It is great that you can go in there.

66
00:04:04,320 --> 00:04:08,240
- Because there are many housing associations you can look at.

67
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:12,080
- Really!
 It's just that you have to google a little and I didn't.

68
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:14,480
Google without panic.
 Strong tip!
