1
00:00:01,240 --> 00:00:07,320
Sweden's history between the 16th and 19th centuries is divided into four eras.

2
00:00:07,480 --> 00:00:12,480
-This is the other of them.
 -The stern time was a gloomy time.

3
00:00:12,640 --> 00:00:18,280
People lived with the three major threats war, plague and famine.

4
00:00:18,440 --> 00:00:24,280
The great power is a dramatic time and lasts for over a hundred years.

5
00:00:24,440 --> 00:00:32,320
From Gustav II Adolf becoming king until Karl XII is shot and dies.

6
00:00:32,480 --> 00:00:38,400
What happened during the Great Power time?
 Why was 60 % of the kings Karl?

7
00:00:38,560 --> 00:00:43,600
And how was the life of ordinary people in Sweden when the country was greatest?

8
00:00:54,480 --> 00:01:00,360
What we see here are the remains of three 16th century shirts.

9
00:01:00,520 --> 00:01:05,920
What makes them special is all stains, and there are blood stains.

10
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:10,800
These are the three shirts like Gustav II Adolf Bar-

11
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:15,280
-When he found dead on the battlefield at Lützen.

12
00:01:15,440 --> 00:01:21,520
Sweden's first 17th century king dies in today's Germany, 37 years old.

13
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:28,520
He is called the lion of the Nordic countries, and Sweden appears as a great power.

14
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:31,240
How is that possible?

15
00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:37,680
How has the sparsely populated, neglected country in northern Europe ended up here?

16
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:43,080
Some we can probably thank Gustav II Adolf's grandfather Gustav for.

17
00:01:43,240 --> 00:01:47,760
It comes from the 16th century.
 Gustav Vasa has united the country.

18
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:53,720
He has built up a military power and an administration - a modern state.

19
00:01:54,920 --> 00:01:58,360
Sweden does not look like today.

20
00:01:58,520 --> 00:02:03,280
The kingdom is smaller in the south and west, but Finland is included.

21
00:02:03,440 --> 00:02:09,920
Stockholm is centrally located in the country where transport is mostly done at sea.

22
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:16,400
Sweden has developed into a more modern and cohesive kingdom.

23
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:20,120
Developments are not just happening in Sweden.

24
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:25,440
Around Europe throughout Europe, the princes build up strong nations.

25
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:31,240
In the 17th century they stand there with their strong armies and fleets-

26
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:34,680
-And is ready to put them into work.

27
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:38,080
And then we get these big wars.

28
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:43,920
Here is Gustav II Adolf in better condition than on the battlefield down in Lützen.

29
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:47,000
Not a single blood stain on the collar.

30
00:02:47,160 --> 00:02:54,400
In the fall of 1611 he takes over the throne of his hard-by-father father Karl Ix-

31
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:57,240
-And becomes regent of Sweden.

32
00:02:57,440 --> 00:03:01,680
Gustav II Adolf, insofar as one reflects on him-

33
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:05,120
-You see him as a war king.

34
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:09,160
Although he modernizes Sweden-

35
00:03:09,320 --> 00:03:13,680
-Spend Gustav II Adolf a lot of time on the battlefield.

36
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:19,000
He inherits not only the crown of his father, but also three ongoing wars.

37
00:03:19,160 --> 00:03:25,880
How does the new regent manage it?
 Well, he has talent to lead troops.

38
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:33,000
Napoleon has with him on his top list of historical field lords.

39
00:03:33,160 --> 00:03:40,240
The Swedish army takes over parts of the Baltic, and Sweden is growing a bit.

40
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:45,960
The wars demanded their soldiers, so they made a decision on Parliament.

41
00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:49,640
Okay, we print every tenth man.

42
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:54,920
They had discharge commissaries that came and would choose them.

43
00:03:55,080 --> 00:04:00,000
Every tenth person between 15 years and 60. And this was coercion.

44
00:04:00,160 --> 00:04:07,040
If you are taken out, just go.
 The probability of returning is low.

45
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:13,440
A large part of the sold out soldiers die far away from home and family.

46
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:17,400
What is it like to be a 15-year-old boy-

47
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:22,280
-and stand there and wait for their judgment?
 Is it me who has to go today?

48
00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:30,240
The war creates a surplus of women.
 Women are allowed to take over men's chores.

49
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:36,640
For war, a little is going on all the time, and now a really big one comes.

50
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:40,160
In 1618, the thirty -year war begins.

51
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:45,000
There is a conflict on the continent between Catholics and Protestants.

52
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:49,920
Gustav II Adolf and Axel Oxenstierna have their eyes on the conflict-

53
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:53,480
-And is thinking about Sweden's role.

54
00:04:53,640 --> 00:05:00,520
Nothing forces Sweden to join the war, but the governing bodies do it anyway.

55
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:04,960
In 1630, Sweden joins the Protestant side.

56
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:09,120
It is about two things: religion and power.

57
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:12,320
It is the time in Sweden's history-

58
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:17,840
-which is the most religious fundamentalist.

59
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:22,920
Neither before nor after have been so fanatical Lutherans.

60
00:05:23,080 --> 00:05:26,200
Religiosity has a certain significance.

61
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:32,000
But it is not the only reason to force Swedes to fight in Europe.

62
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:36,280
One wants to expand Sweden's borders-

63
00:05:36,440 --> 00:05:40,600
-And mark its place on the international stage.

64
00:05:40,760 --> 00:05:47,200
Fundamental to entry into the war is control over the Baltic Sea trade.

65
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:54,840
Sweden embarks on a European tour, and the king sits at the front.

66
00:05:55,000 --> 00:06:02,960
Swedish kings during the superpower period fight together with their strengths.

67
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:08,920
-They are not desktop generals.
 -It is going well for the Swedish army.

68
00:06:09,080 --> 00:06:14,000
More than a hundred German cities fall into Swedish hands and the country is only growing.

69
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:20,680
Sweden becomes Europe's third largest kingdom, but what is it for the conquered?

70
00:06:20,840 --> 00:06:24,840
Do they feel like Swedes when the national border is redone?

71
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:28,520
Swedishness was so and so.

72
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:33,360
Everyone who belonged to the Swedish Empire did not feel like Swedes.

73
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:40,480
For some, it became undramatic, and for others it was more problematic.

74
00:06:40,640 --> 00:06:46,160
When the army comes to Lützen, it goes as it goes for the lion from the Nordic countries.

75
00:06:46,320 --> 00:06:51,320
Next in the throne is the king's daughter Kristina who is only five years old.

76
00:06:51,480 --> 00:06:54,520
It is her we see here at the bottom of the portrait.

77
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:59,440
Now Sweden suddenly stands without adult regent and in the midst of a burning war-

78
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:06,840
-With a war -tired population at home and a lot of soldiers in Germany.

79
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:14,000
This will be a crisis in Sweden that you still do quite well.

80
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:18,680
Chancellor Axel Oxenstierna gets a strong role-

81
00:07:18,840 --> 00:07:22,840
-And you decide to stay in the war.

82
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:30,720
Kristina will take over the throne and study everything a regent needs to know.

83
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:34,080
She is seen as brilliant and brilliant-

84
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:38,080
-But is she more brilliant than anyone else?

85
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:42,240
In any case, she is interested in these issues.

86
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:46,840
Through the wars down in Europe, it brings in books and knowledge-

87
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:50,600
-As comes from the conquered areas.

88
00:07:50,760 --> 00:07:56,360
This pompous mantle carries Kristina when she is crowned to Swedish queen.

89
00:07:56,520 --> 00:07:59,640
But is this something for her?

90
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:04,280
Kristina is raised to become king and a good Lutheran.

91
00:08:04,440 --> 00:08:10,200
The idea is that she should get married, but none of that she is comfortable with.

92
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:15,680
Kristina probably looked at Swedish cultural life with some contempt.

93
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:19,680
Sweden was a cultural backwater.

94
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:29,920
Sweden was too small for Kristina's ambitions and desires-

95
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:33,240
-and what she wanted out of her life.

96
00:08:33,400 --> 00:08:38,680
She is inspired by what she has read by Catholic thinkers and philosophers.

97
00:08:38,840 --> 00:08:46,400
Before the National Council, she says that she never intends to marry anyone.

98
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:52,200
But it will be even more shocking, because in June 1654 the Queen tells you

99
00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:56,480
-That she has decided to abdicate.

100
00:08:56,640 --> 00:09:03,560
It will soon come out that she will convert and become Catholic.

101
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:09,280
The religion that the father has fought for and made himself known for-

102
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:14,320
-The she abanders it and joins the same team as his main enemies.

103
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:20,320
And she allies with the Pope in Rome.
 It is unspeakably large.

104
00:09:21,280 --> 00:09:28,520
More were probably rendered in Sweden, but not everyone could move to Italy.

105
00:09:28,680 --> 00:09:35,240
It is miserable, plague and so cold that it is called the small ice age.

106
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:38,400
What did the Swedes do for fun?

107
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:42,520
During the Great Power, people played a lot-

108
00:09:42,680 --> 00:09:46,480
-And is happy to make a party.

109
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:52,280
There were not many days in the calendar without any festive event.

110
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:56,440
Then all who had worked in the village- gathered

111
00:09:56,600 --> 00:10:00,560
-and there was beer, dance, music, games and food.

112
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:07,920
Young people wanted to meet, and they were a little neighbor an engine in the party.

113
00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:12,160
Often the young people were left at last

114
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:17,120
-And the priest and others were horrified at their playing and dancing.

115
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:24,200
There is not a big difference in how people in different social classes have fun.

116
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:27,400
They move within the same kind of games.

117
00:10:27,560 --> 00:10:34,560
Ring dances, long dances, races to the church - that kind of games.

118
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:40,800
Despite famine, plague and war, there were flashes of light during the time of great power.

119
00:10:40,960 --> 00:10:48,440
The newspaper system is born, better roads are being built and the postal service becomes safer.

120
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:52,800
The queen has left the ship.
 Who should take over the helm?

121
00:10:52,960 --> 00:10:59,320
Well, someone who thought they would get married - her cousin Karl Gustav.

122
00:10:59,480 --> 00:11:03,480
Karl Gustav is raised in the same way as Kristina.

123
00:11:03,640 --> 00:11:07,240
But he has no natural inheritance right.

124
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:14,120
The only way for him to become king is to marry Kristina.

125
00:11:14,280 --> 00:11:18,680
But she will not marry anyone at all.

126
00:11:18,840 --> 00:11:23,560
However, she appoints Karl as a successor before abdicating.

127
00:11:23,720 --> 00:11:26,440
He becomes King Karl X Gustav.

128
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:31,840
If it is difficult with different names of kings, here are three men on the rake.

129
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:38,560
It may seem unimaginative with Karl X Gustav, Karl XI and Karl XII.

130
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:43,520
But there was a tradition of giving the first -born son the father's name.

131
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:50,440
Karl X Gustav is king for almost six years and is in principle all the time.

132
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:53,520
No domestic policy is possible.

133
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:58,240
He trains over the ice at Belt and Sweden turns at Sig-

134
00:11:58,400 --> 00:12:01,880
-Skåne, Blekinge, Bohuslän and Halland.

135
00:12:02,040 --> 00:12:06,600
Now the kingdom is super big.
 As big as it will ever be.

136
00:12:06,760 --> 00:12:11,160
The project Gustav II Adolf started has succeeded.

137
00:12:11,320 --> 00:12:15,160
Sweden controls the Baltic Sea area-

138
00:12:15,320 --> 00:12:19,440
-But that means we are at war all the time.

139
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:23,160
Why did people put up war?

140
00:12:23,320 --> 00:12:27,280
They had a propaganda, and most important was the church.

141
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:34,680
Everyone went to church, and there you could read stories from the war.

142
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:41,280
Now people also imagine that some can be something other than people.

143
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:43,440
Witches.

144
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:50,600
The witch processes are a defined period called the great noise.

145
00:12:50,760 --> 00:12:57,440
Sometimes you get the image that the witch processes took place throughout the country.

146
00:12:57,600 --> 00:13:00,280
That's not really true.

147
00:13:00,440 --> 00:13:06,680
Under the great noise, as it is called many screaming in the phas-

148
00:13:06,840 --> 00:13:09,400
-for what they were exposed to

149
00:13:09,560 --> 00:13:14,240
-About three hundred women and the occasional magician are executed.

150
00:13:14,400 --> 00:13:22,320
Life is better for the half -percent of the population that controls - the nobility.

151
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:26,120
They live in abundance thanks to the wars-

152
00:13:26,280 --> 00:13:30,920
-And many stately castles and houses are being built around Sweden.

153
00:13:31,080 --> 00:13:37,120
But despite beautiful dwellings and comfortable beds, the women are not so free.

154
00:13:37,280 --> 00:13:41,120
They first belong to their father and then their husband.

155
00:13:41,280 --> 00:13:46,800
How is it for the highest -ranking women in the country - the queens?

156
00:13:46,960 --> 00:13:52,600
Clearly, their most important task is to give birth to throne heirs.

157
00:13:52,760 --> 00:13:56,000
They are also included in a political gaming-

158
00:13:56,160 --> 00:14:01,960
-There it is important to associate alliances between Sweden and other countries.

159
00:14:02,120 --> 00:14:06,160
Here is one of the most influential queens-

160
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:10,200
-Hedvig Eleonora, married to Karl X Gustav.

161
00:14:10,360 --> 00:14:15,320
She came from Holstein-Gottorp to which Sweden wanted strong ties.

162
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:23,240
When her husband dies, she becomes a widow queen and sees children and grandchildren take the throne.

163
00:14:23,400 --> 00:14:27,720
She stands for the continuity of the state lead-

164
00:14:27,880 --> 00:14:32,360
-And must probably be said to be the one you listen to.

165
00:14:32,520 --> 00:14:35,960
Now her son is King Karl XI.

166
00:14:36,120 --> 00:14:40,120
He has no ambition to make Sweden bigger.

167
00:14:40,280 --> 00:14:45,280
He has realized that the achievements of his father have reached-

168
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:49,680
-Where somewhere is probably Sweden's capacity.

169
00:14:49,840 --> 00:14:56,640
He reigns Sweden during peacetime and has time to organize the country.

170
00:14:56,800 --> 00:15:01,920
He changes the military selection and regains properties from nobility-

171
00:15:02,080 --> 00:15:04,720
-In the so -called reduction.

172
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:10,640
He dies 41 years old in stomach cancer as a very popular and popular king.

173
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:14,160
His teenage son takes over the kingdom.

174
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:20,680
When the country has a young, inexperienced king, Sweden's enemies attack at the same time.

175
00:15:20,840 --> 00:15:25,200
Now comes the Great Nordic War - all against Sweden.

176
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:30,960
Karl XII is 18 years old, and the enemies believe he should not be so experienced

177
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:36,560
-Or manage to handle this collected onslaught of three enemies.

178
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:41,120
Denmark gives up as soon as he lands there.

179
00:15:41,280 --> 00:15:46,080
He defeats the Russian army in Narva and wins even at Riga.

180
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:51,840
Rumor has begun to go that the Swedish king is invincible.

181
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:56,520
Then they reach Poltava, and there is not as good at all.

182
00:15:56,680 --> 00:16:00,880
Karl XII loses the battle at Poltava.

183
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:06,680
Suddenly, Karl XII has no field army and is close to being captured.

184
00:16:06,840 --> 00:16:11,520
He simply has to escape with what remains of his troops.

185
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:17,920
He flees to Turkey and remains for 5 years.
 Meanwhile, the plague reaches Sweden.

186
00:16:18,080 --> 00:16:24,480
One third of Stockholm's population dies.
 In the kingdom over 100,000 people.

187
00:16:24,640 --> 00:16:30,000
When the king returns, the country is super poor and badly infected.

188
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:33,400
Russia has knocked the Baltic.

189
00:16:33,560 --> 00:16:37,360
A war becomes the end of Karl XII's life.

190
00:16:37,520 --> 00:16:42,000
In 1718 in a trenches in the Norwegian city of Fredrikshald-

191
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:45,560
-He is met by a bullet in his head.

192
00:16:45,720 --> 00:16:49,840
He has never had time to get a son-

193
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:54,880
-On all life struggled to keep the great kingdom he has inherited.

194
00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:57,880
Karl XII is a warrior king.

195
00:16:58,040 --> 00:17:02,720
He is king for 21 years, and he for war during 18 of those years.

196
00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:09,960
But he does not start a single war, but Sweden is attacking.

197
00:17:10,120 --> 00:17:15,880
Sweden simply had too little resources for the large land mass.

198
00:17:16,040 --> 00:17:20,840
The kingdom has shrunk back to almost what it looked like before the time of great power.

199
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:25,720
After Karl XII's death, his soldiers will take home.

200
00:17:25,880 --> 00:17:30,680
It is cold and they do not have enough food and firewood.

201
00:17:30,840 --> 00:17:34,960
Many of the soldiers freeze to the mountains.

202
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:41,120
I've always seen it as some kind of very sad, but true, vignette-

203
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:44,040
-To the end for the time of the superpower.

204
00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:50,400
This is how many have a picture of the equality - from a known painting.

205
00:17:50,560 --> 00:17:56,040
The picture has been seen by generations and everyone thinks that this is how it went.

206
00:17:56,200 --> 00:17:58,840
It didn't.

207
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:06,040
Did he lie on a stretcher?
 No, he lay in a pine box.
 A coffin, simply.

208
00:18:06,200 --> 00:18:10,800
Was he carried over the mountain ranges?
 The dramatic mountains.
 Not at all.

209
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:17,280
He was shot in southern Norway.
 There are soft ridges, rolling hills.

210
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:22,200
But why do you portray Karl XII's equality in this way?

211
00:18:22,360 --> 00:18:26,520
Well, to create a sense of the nation Sweden.

212
00:18:26,680 --> 00:18:30,240
We want a common history.

213
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:35,920
Common heroes are good and Karl XII is becoming a hero.

214
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:39,040
He becomes Swedish.

215
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:45,440
The great power period has for a long time been told with a romantic shimmer-

216
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:49,600
-There brave heroes won a blow after blows.

217
00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:56,320
But war is also dead and suffering, both for the losers and for the winners.

218
00:18:56,480 --> 00:18:59,600
What are the traces after the time of the Great Power?

219
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:05,960
Sweden is a moral superpower that tells the world what to do.

220
00:19:06,120 --> 00:19:09,960
Geographically, the tracks are clear.

221
00:19:10,120 --> 00:19:15,920
Skåne, Blekinge, Bohuslän and Halland have been Swedish ever since.

222
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:22,200
And although it was mostly war, both Gustav II Adolf and Karl XI-

223
00:19:22,360 --> 00:19:27,720
-Inat and change things in Sweden's administration that still remain today.

224
00:19:27,880 --> 00:19:35,080
Most of us, if we were to go back in time and live that life-

225
00:19:35,240 --> 00:19:38,400
-Would probably think it was difficult.

226
