1
00:00:03,560 --> 00:00:07,600
I feel stressed, because I'm afraid I will be wrong.

2
00:00:07,760 --> 00:00:14,560
If something goes wrong in math, I sink down far, and I do not want to.

3
00:00:14,720 --> 00:00:17,840
One cannot plug in to it-

4
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,000
-So it's pretty quiet, though it's still stressful.

5
00:00:21,160 --> 00:00:24,000
It weighs a lot for the grade.

6
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:29,080
The stress is first.
 Then it is also the nervousness.

7
00:00:29,240 --> 00:00:32,920
If I'm really nervous I get a blackout and forget everything.

8
00:00:33,080 --> 00:00:38,760
I'm more nervous about saying something wrong, or I don't remember.

9
00:00:38,920 --> 00:00:45,320
Often I know what to say but it will be: "What would I say again?"

10
00:00:45,480 --> 00:00:47,480
Then it doesn't feel good at all.

11
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:53,600
It is individual when it comes to the approach to the national test.

12
00:00:53,760 --> 00:01:00,880
Some are stressed, others do not, but there are those who do not care.

13
00:01:01,040 --> 00:01:06,240
One tip is: Believe in yourself!
 Believe plenty of yourself.

14
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:10,160
Believe that you are actually capable of doing good from you.

15
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:16,560
But also try to visualize the test and the test day and how it goes.

16
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:23,840
It is a key component.
 How is it when you get a difficult question?

17
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,840
How should you attack the problem?

18
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:31,640
Often you get a blackout, the thoughts may go in another direction.

19
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:36,800
Then it is nice if you have visualized the situation in advance

20
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:39,600
-And knows how to handle it.

21
00:01:39,760 --> 00:01:44,240
In addition to visualizing the sample, you can take the help of Provision Strategies-

22
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:49,480
-If you were to suffer from brain drops.
 Start by taking a few deep breaths.

23
00:01:49,640 --> 00:01:52,280
Try to bring down your stress level.

24
00:01:52,440 --> 00:01:56,240
Keep in mind that the test is not the whole world.

25
00:01:56,400 --> 00:02:01,400
Once you have reduced the stress level, it may be easier to think clearly.

26
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:07,400
If you do not get the answer even though you know you can really it-

27
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:12,320
-Be about a scrap paper and write down everything you can about that topic.

28
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:17,040
If you still do not come up with the answer, leave the question and move on.

29
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:20,520
Maybe you will be the answer in a while.

30
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:25,800
Read the instructions properly, so you don't miss any part of the task.

31
00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:31,240
Mark everything expected of you.
 Then you see that you answered everything.

32
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:37,920
My top-three strategies are: plug, eat and sleep well before a test.

33
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:43,240
My teacher says I should take it easy and rest.

34
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:47,160
Type load me, so I can do my best.

35
00:02:47,320 --> 00:02:52,640
Like sleeping, so I get energy, eat well, work out a little neighbor.

36
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:59,760
You have to take it easy, think what you say, so nothing is wrong.

37
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:03,520
Stressing through it is not good.

38
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:07,960
There are difficulties with reading comprehension.

39
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:10,920
It is not only to perceive it that stand-

40
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:16,760
-Or to even start reading and cope with all the text written.

41
00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:21,320
It gets too much, it looks messy.
 One tip then is:

42
00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:24,440
Try to change your way of thinking.

43
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:29,720
Don't think: What a lot of text!
 Without: What fun, now I'll read this!

44
00:03:29,880 --> 00:03:32,600
What will I learn from this?

45
00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:39,240
When we change the way of thinking, the brain behaves in a different way.

46
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:42,040
Hopefully it will facilitate.

47
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:45,200
It is difficult to plug to the national sample-

48
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:48,120
-But a great way to upload for the linguistic parts-

49
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:51,480
-As listening to podcasts and reading books in the language.

50
00:03:51,640 --> 00:03:56,560
So that you practice the habit of listening and taking in information.

51
00:03:56,720 --> 00:04:00,320
Keep in mind that the tests are quite long, so prepare for it.

52
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:05,440
Check with your teacher if it is okay to bring something to eat or drink.

53
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:11,320
And perhaps most importantly: believe in yourself and try to take it easy.
