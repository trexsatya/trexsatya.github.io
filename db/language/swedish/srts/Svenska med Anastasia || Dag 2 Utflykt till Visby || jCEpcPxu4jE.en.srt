1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Good morning.
 It is half past seven in the morning and I woke up to go to the bathroom.

2
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:25,000
But check, I don't want to go back.
 I don't want to sleep again.
 I don't want to fall asleep.
 I can not.

3
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Now I'm going to take a walk instead.
 It doesn't blow.
 It is completely still.
 The sun is shining, it's hot.

4
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Everyone is asleep.
 Only me is awake throughout the campsite.
 We take a walk together.

5
00:00:51,000 --> 00:01:01,000
One has woken up and will walk with his dog.
 She should rest the dog.
 We are two who are awake.

6
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:19,000
There is a flagpole, two flagpoles and you can see that the flags are completely still.
 It doesn't blow at all.

7
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:38,000
The campsite is called Herta Camping.
 You can look at the map on Gotland, where it is located.
 Drive slowly.

8
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Look what amazing flowers.
 Giant.
 Superfine on both sides.
 Here is my shadow.

9
00:01:50,000 --> 00:02:02,000
There is the sea.
 The campsite is very close to the beach.

10
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Check this out.
 It's a cows.
 Several cows.
 A kiss.
 Several kisses.
 What do they do?
 That kiss is itching.

11
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:48,000
It scratches the forehead.
 Those stand and eat something.
 Completely still.
 This road is a dirt road.

12
00:02:48,000 --> 00:03:09,000
I walk on the dirt road.
 Over there is the sea.
 The sea is also completely still because it does not blow.

13
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:34,000
So this is a pasture.
 A cowhage for cows.
 And this is a horse pasture.
 A cowhage and a horse pasture.

14
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:51,000
This horse stands and eats.
 It is said that the horse grazes.
 And that horse is sleeping.

15
00:03:51,000 --> 00:04:07,000
It looks like that.
 We continue forward to the beach.
 Just on the beach there are some houses.

16
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:28,000
These houses are very small.
 A small house.
 Many small houses.
 They are not real.
 I think it's cottages.

17
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:49,000
Or so before, people lived in slightly smaller houses.
 I can reach the ceiling.

18
00:05:08,602 --> 00:05:23,000
An old bench.
 On that bench you dare not sit.
 It is very old and route.

19
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:42,000
Do you see?
 But it stands here.
 It is so pretty.
 Check.
 It is certainly from the mid-20th century.

20
00:05:42,000 --> 00:06:11,000
Just look.
 Absolutely wonderful.
 There are many good places on Gotland safely.
 But this place is definitely not the last.

21
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:33,000
Wow.
 It's just wow.
 I am completely fascinated.
 Check out these.
 In many places you build like this.

22
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:52,000
So here find these flat stones.
 For example, a bench and a table.
 A sofa and a coffee table.

23
00:06:52,000 --> 00:07:10,000
Here they have made a bench.
 I think they built these houses in the same way as well.

24
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:22,000
Flat stones and then sprinkled with concrete or cement.
 Or I don't know.
 With something.

25
00:07:32,576 --> 00:07:49,364
Today is Saturday and I will have live on Youtube.
 But today I will have live at 11am until 12 o'clock.

26
00:07:49,364 --> 00:08:02,000
Otherwise it will be too stressful in the morning.
 It takes about an hour from Herta Camping from this place to Visby.

27
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:17,000
So if I start at 10 o'clock then we have to leave home type quarter to nine.
 It's a little too early I can say.

28
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:37,000
So just today 11 to 12. I know what to do.
 I'll do my morning gymnastics here on the beach.

29
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:40,000
You can look a little if you want.

30
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:57,000
Now I have done my morning gymnastics.
 Now I can dip my feet a little neighbor.
 Dip feet.

31
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:15,000
I feel the water.
 The water is actually quite cold today.

32
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:28,000
Yesterday the water was not so cold.
 I thought the water was totally okay yesterday.
 I didn't bathe.
 It was late at night.

33
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:40,000
But I thought it was totally okay.
 But now I think the water is cold.
 There may be a difference in the morning and evening.

34
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
I do not know.
 We'll see.

35
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:55,000
We are eating breakfast.
 Our neighbors cycle to the next stop.
 To the next campsite.
 They cycle throughout Gotland.

36
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:59,000
Now we are in Visby and I am starting to live.

37
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:22,000
The clock rings and I end the lives.

38
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:36,000
Today we are in Visby.
 Day two in Visby.

39
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:51,000
This is Stora Torget.
 Stora Torget.
 Here is trade.
 You can shop, buy jewelry, clothes.

40
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:55,000
There is a church ruin.

41
00:10:55,000 --> 00:11:07,000
And throughout Visby, here inside the walls, there are many cafes and restaurants and right now there are many tourists here.

42
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:14,000
Many, many tourists who come from Sweden, from the mainland but also from other countries.

43
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:29,000
Santa Karin's church.
 An old church from the end of the 17th century.

44
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,000
Check this out.

45
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:37,000
We have looked at this church.

46
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:49,000
What is this?
 This is ivy that is growing.

47
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:57,000
There are many different plants here in Visby.

48
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:07,000
Plants that grow on the walls.

49
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:12,000
That climbs on the walls.

50
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:18,000
Here is a small scene.
 You can do different events.

51
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,000
Old stones.

52
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:31,000
And here there is also the roof left.
 The roof is made of small, small stones.

53
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:45,000
A sheep.
 So there are large stone sheep in the square and everywhere.

54
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:52,000
In Stockholm it is lion and on Gotland it is sheep.

55
00:13:07,003 --> 00:13:16,926
There is a wall around Visbystaden.
 This is a wall.

56
00:13:17,545 --> 00:13:23,000
This is a tower.
 This is a gate.

57
00:13:24,233 --> 00:13:32,209
The wall goes around Visby.

58
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:40,000
You can walk here.
 Inside the wall is the old town.

59
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:47,197
Outside the wall, it is the new city maybe.

60
00:13:47,197 --> 00:13:50,000
Look, there are these here.
 I don't know what it is.

61
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:54,000
Here there are bikes.
 They park their bikes.

62
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:59,000
And on the walls there are plants.

63
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:07,417
So this is growing.
 I do not know how.
 How does it grow?

64
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:28,000
We want to go this train.

65
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:35,000
Blue-yellow train.
 Guided city tour.

66
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:45,000
Children, 3 to 10 years, SEK 50.

67
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:49,065
Adults, SEK 100.

68
00:14:49,065 --> 00:14:52,000
Tickets are solved on the train.
 See the clock.
 Departures.

69
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,000
See the clock.
 This watch.

70
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:57,000
What time is it?
 At one o'clock maybe.

71
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:05,000
Here they hand out free 7UP.
 Thanks so much.

72
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:15,000
Now we have sat on the train but we are sitting back and forth.

73
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:18,000
So we're going to go with our backs.

74
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:27,000
I have an ice cream.

75
00:15:53,000 --> 00:16:09,000
We take a train.
 We look at Visby, at the wall, the ring wall and listen to the guide.

76
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:16,000
It speaks Swedish in speakers.
 These are speakers, so we listen to the guide.

77
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:24,000
For us, the trip with this train cost SEK 400.

78
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,000
Two children's tickets.

79
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:39,000
We paid for two children's tickets for the girls.

80
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:43,000
A children's ticket costs SEK 50 and three adults.

81
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,000
Then it will be SEK 400.

82
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:09,819
Then we met our friends there and walked with them for the rest of the day.

83
00:18:10,079 --> 00:18:16,079
So all Saturday we were in Visby.

84
00:18:52,604 --> 00:18:57,604
It was a pink party on the beach.

85
00:18:57,604 --> 00:19:00,850
Everyone wore pink clothes.

86
00:19:01,006 --> 00:19:05,010
They danced and they had fun.

87
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:44,248
Now it is evening and we will go home and lie down and sleep.

88
00:19:44,664 --> 00:19:55,164
Thank you so much for watching.
 Tomorrow it will be day three.
 Do not miss it.
 Bye!
