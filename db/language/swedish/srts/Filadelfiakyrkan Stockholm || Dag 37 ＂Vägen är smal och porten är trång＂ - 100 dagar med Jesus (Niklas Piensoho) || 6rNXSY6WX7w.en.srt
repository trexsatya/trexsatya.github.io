1
00:00:00.630 --> 00:00:02.077
Day 37.

2
00:00:03.223 --> 00:00:07.244
In the Gospel of Matthew 7:14, Jesus says

3
00:00:07.244 --> 00:00:10.491
that the road is slim and the gate is crowded

4
00:00:10.840 --> 00:00:12.100
And few find it.

5
00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:17.558
As long as one is busy by oneself more than by Jesus

6
00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.561
So you never get up on the road.

7
00:00:20.956 --> 00:00:24.712
You will constantly lose balance and end up aside.

8
00:00:25.443 --> 00:00:27.736
It's like when I was going to the boom.

9
00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:29.774
My feet were far too big

10
00:00:29.774 --> 00:00:31.701
and the boom far too narrow,

11
00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:33.388
it wouldn't go

12
00:00:33.928 --> 00:00:36.048
But as soon as I stopped looking at myself

13
00:00:36.114 --> 00:00:38.934
and instead attached the gaze to the wire in the wall

14
00:00:39.316 --> 00:00:40.356
That's how it worked.

15
00:00:41.537 --> 00:00:45.440
The biggest problem that many have when they become Christians

16
00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:50.421
is that they become too busy by themselves and their own failures

17
00:00:50.919 --> 00:00:54.141
Instead of being occupied by Jesus.

18
00:00:54.947 --> 00:00:57.287
The road is really slim

19
00:00:57.387 --> 00:00:59.255
and the gate is actually slim,

20
00:00:59.878 --> 00:01:02.672
and there is only one way to walk on the road

21
00:01:02.772 --> 00:01:04.476
and get in through the gate

22
00:01:04.840 --> 00:01:09.142
And that is by looking at Jesus.

23
00:01:09.682 --> 00:01:11.204
Spiritual exercise:

24
00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:15.652
Do a five -day experiment:

25
00:01:16.599 --> 00:01:23.365
Try to start the day with a moment of prayer and Bible reading for the rest of the week.

26
00:01:23.756 --> 00:01:25.760
Evaluate this and see

27
00:01:26.092 --> 00:01:29.181
If it is an order that suits you.

28
00:01:30.256 --> 00:01:31.931
God bless you.
