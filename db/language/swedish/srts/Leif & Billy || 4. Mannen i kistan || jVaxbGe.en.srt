00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:13.800
Kronofogden, Debt Collection, Kronofogden, Pizzeria ...

00:00:13.960 --> 00:00:20.080
The pension is int 'worth opening.
 Check!
 A letter from cousin Ronny.

3
00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:25.520
-Where is he?
 - Kao Laok, something.
 Safe Thailand.

4
00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:33.160
"Hello! Can you post a pair of logs snus to the hotel? Address below."

5
00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:38.680
- With what money then?
 - He lives life, he.

6
00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:44.160
Damn.
 Letter from the Employment Service.

7
00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:51.640
- What the hell are they want this time?
 - We should take some fucking course.

8
00:00:55.920 --> 00:01:03.120
They want us to come down.
 They serve with the a-box.
 We have to go at once.

9
00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:07.320
That they can never leave us in peace!

10
00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:18.880
I have called you here as you have not applied for a job for a while.

11
00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:23.120
How's your job searching?

12
00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:29.600
I have taken some responsibility and applied for a job on my own.

13
00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:35.600
I applied to be a personal assistant to Billy.

14
00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:38.960
But I didn't get that.

15
00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:44.760
I have looked if the pizzeria needs to reach 'security guards, but ...

16
00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:51.000
It is difficult to get a job in today's society.
 We have the farm too.

17
00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:58.760
The other day it went down a badger and sat down in the course at the pasture.

18
00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:04.200
He was dead when we found him.
 It was electric shocks and colds.

19
00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:10.200
We had to thaw him with his mother's hair dryer before we stopped him.

20
00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:16.080
We usually try to sell them on the market and get some money.

21
00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:22.320
I have contacted you several times for you to attend job search courses.

22
00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:25.760
If you will not, you will not receive a cash register.

23
00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:32.400
How should I get it?
 I have the farm, and Billy should be seen after.

24
00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:37.440
He seems to be adult enough to manage himself.

25
00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:42.520
I see no other way than to withdraw your a-cash.

26
00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:49.920
You send us straight down into poverty?
 Fy fuck.
 Oh, oh, what a fun message!

27
00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:57.280
How, then, should I buy snuff and beer ...?
 Or I mean milk and food.

28
00:02:57.440 --> 00:03:03.320
Billy is a osteoporosis and needs nutritional supplements.
 Where is the money?

29
00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:08.840
I have lived with scurvy in previous poverty conditions.

30
00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:16.440
Go on the courses I call, so maybe I can reconsider the decision.

31
00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:20.440
Should it be like this, we go home.

32
00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:26.200
These heartless people see us rather starve-

33
00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:29.920
- Enter to stretch a helping hand.

34
00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:35.840
Yes, it's Malin ... stomach ailment?!

35
00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:41.640
Wait!
 Would you be able to work today?

36
00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:49.000
-Do we get back the A-box then?
 - Yes, for a while to come.

37
00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:53.120
We are not shaded.
 We'll take it.

38
00:03:54.320 --> 00:03:57.360
Jesus is a Friend of Mine Jesus is my friend

39
00:03:57.520 --> 00:04:01.600
Jesus is a Friend of Mine I have a friend in Jesus

40
00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:10.320
What good that you could come up with such short notice.

41
00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:15.600
There is a stomach ailment here, and I will have a funeral.

42
00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:19.520
Here is a list of what you have to do.

43
00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:24.520
- Do you have no more decent clothes?
 -No.

44
00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:30.120
I go out and look for it.
 Wait here, I solve it.

45
00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:37.920
-Good job.
 You have to dress up.
 - Hope it is well paid as well.

46
00:04:42.440 --> 00:04:48.000
You clean, so I put out hymn books and light candles.

47
00:04:48.160 --> 00:04:54.520
- Remember: Don't sabotage this.
 -It is quiet.
 You can trust me.

48
00:04:57.200 --> 00:05:03.720
It's Been A Hard Day's Night and i've Been Working Like A Dog

49
00:05:03.880 --> 00:05:10.520
It's Been A Hard Day's Night, I Should Be Sleeping Like A Log

50
00:05:10.680 --> 00:05:14.040
But when I get home to you i find the things that you do

51
00:05:14.200 --> 00:05:17.400
will make me feel alright

52
00:05:17.560 --> 00:05:24.560
You Know I Work All Day to Get You Money, To Buy You Things

53
00:05:24.720 --> 00:05:27.760
And it's Worth it just to hear you say:

54
00:05:27.920 --> 00:05:32.440
You Know, in Feel Alright

55
00:05:32.600 --> 00:05:36.080
Now I am ready.
 What do we do now?

56
00:05:36.240 --> 00:05:41.520
Check that the microphone works, in which the priest devil should talk in.

57
00:05:41.680 --> 00:05:46.600
Hello?
 God?
 Jesus?
 No, it doesn't go.

58
00:05:46.760 --> 00:05:52.800
You may well check if there is something gap or reach '.
 Use the brain cells now.

59
00:05:54.960 --> 00:05:57.160
Hello?

60
00:06:26.920 --> 00:06:32.320
Satan.
 Hello?
 - Leif, now it goes!

61
00:06:28.320 --> 00:06:32.320
It echoes high

62
00:06:32.480 --> 00:06:38.520
Hello!
 The god Billy speaks to the people of Sörbäcken.

63
00:06:38.680 --> 00:06:44.560
God damn, Billy!
 Don't play in God's house.
 Focus now!

64
00:06:45.880 --> 00:06:52.280
- Day to pick up the coffin with Knut.
 -We will fix it.

65
00:07:03.800 --> 00:07:09.760
-Are you ready?
 -Yes.
 Psalm books, light and cleaning.

66
00:07:09.920 --> 00:07:12.920
And Billy has fixed your microphone.

67
00:07:13.080 --> 00:07:16.160
Hello!
 Hello?

68
00:07:17.440 --> 00:07:19.400
Hell!

69
00:07:19.560 --> 00:07:24.920
-Oh my God.
 What have we done?!
 - God cursed.

70
00:07:25.080 --> 00:07:29.640
- What the hell are we going to go '?
 - We have to bring him life.
 Water!

71
00:07:29.800 --> 00:07:35.520
The little priest, do not leave us.
 Satan.
 - Throw it at him.

72
00:07:35.680 --> 00:07:38.240
Satan!

73
00:07:38.400 --> 00:07:43.320
–The power.
 - You have to pull out the cable, Billy.

74
00:07:43.480 --> 00:07:46.840
He is coupled high voltage.

75
00:07:52.080 --> 00:07:57.320
- We have killed a priest in God's house.
 - He is not dead!

76
00:07:57.480 --> 00:08:02.040
–Satan.
 - Something is coming.
 What the hell are we going to do?

77
00:08:02.200 --> 00:08:05.920
I have a plan, Billy.
 Come.

78
00:08:16.840 --> 00:08:19.840
Sit down.

79
00:08:48.560 --> 00:08:54.760
Hello and welcome to my congregation in Sörbyn's church.

80
00:08:54.920 --> 00:09:00.840
- Where is Nils, who would be a priest?
 - Unfortunately, niles have left us.

81
00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:05.280
Or ... he had to go home with stomach problems.

82
00:09:05.440 --> 00:09:08.960
I had to move in as a priest ... priest.

83
00:09:09.120 --> 00:09:14.160
We have gathered to honor the body ... or knot.

84
00:09:16.640 --> 00:09:21.640
- Knut ... --... Jonsson.

85
00:09:21.800 --> 00:09:29.880
Knut Jonsson was a big man, who is lately forgotten for everything he did.

86
00:09:30.040 --> 00:09:37.320
- His job ... he worked within ... --... Rumpmoker.

87
00:09:37.480 --> 00:09:44.000
He was a good craftsman, or artist and artist.

88
00:09:44.160 --> 00:09:48.800
That was unbelievable.
 We forget that late, Knut.

89
00:09:48.960 --> 00:09:53.240
His interest in music and dance ...

90
00:09:53.400 --> 00:09:56.760
But my God, he was deaf!

91
00:09:56.920 --> 00:09:59.880
... was not at all.

92
00:10:00.040 --> 00:10:04.320
But he probably wanted to hear the first hymn -

93
00:10:04.480 --> 00:10:08.880
- If he heard ... lived ... or heard.

94
00:10:09.040 --> 00:10:14.200
The organ man, you can start the first hymn.

95
00:10:20.920 --> 00:10:25.640
God's star should shine ...

96
00:10:21.960 --> 00:10:25.640
Happy music

97
00:10:33.600 --> 00:10:35.640
Thanks.

98
00:10:35.800 --> 00:10:39.480
We thank the organ man for the fine ...

99
00:10:37.640 --> 00:10:42.920
Hockey break

100
00:10:52.360 --> 00:10:58.040
Then we thank the organ man for the fine hymn.

101
00:10:58.200 --> 00:11:03.160
- But seriously, what is this?
 - Knut's funeral.

102
00:11:03.320 --> 00:11:06.280
The most amateurish ever!

103
00:11:06.440 --> 00:11:11.840
- Now we calm down.
 - Lug us?!
 This is a joke!

104
00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:17.240
A lot is happening now, and we should not hold on to this in God's house.

105
00:11:17.400 --> 00:11:22.600
We go to Knut and take our last farewell.

106
00:11:25.960 --> 00:11:31.000
Js bach "toccata and fuga in d-minor"

107
00:11:40.080 --> 00:11:45.960
Now take your last farewell to Knut and let Jesus receive him in heaven.

108
00:11:46.120 --> 00:11:52.120
He enjoys Christ's presence and receives him as a little infant.

109
00:11:52.280 --> 00:11:57.800
Now we can move on.
 - Go, Knut!
 Travel far from here.

110
00:12:09.960 --> 00:12:14.960
In the coffin we now have an empty shell of a human being.

111
00:12:15.120 --> 00:12:20.560
His soul has passed on ... somewhere else.

112
00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:25.720
God, cursed!

113
00:12:25.880 --> 00:12:30.120
-What do you do?
 - It's an unusual event.

114
00:12:30.280 --> 00:12:35.480
- Where is my dad?
 - It's Knut that goes on.

115
00:12:35.640 --> 00:12:41.280
Get out of church, so I'll give exorcism.

116
00:12:42.960 --> 00:12:47.200
Then you got fired from your first job.

117
00:12:47.360 --> 00:12:52.360
We should be a glamor that we did not kill that damn priest.

118
00:12:52.520 --> 00:12:56.840
- We get to see it from the bright side.
 -How?

119
00:12:57.000 --> 00:13:03.040
In any case, we have tried to work and are justified A-cash again.

120
00:13:03.200 --> 00:13:07.560
- Should we pull on the grill?
 -We'll do that.
