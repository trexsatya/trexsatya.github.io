00:00:28.672 --> 00:00:31.232
I think I a movie that I think would fit ..

11
00:00:31.488 --> 00:00:34.304
... ER who are interested in caring for your car and

12
00:00:34.816 --> 00:00:38.144
It is quite large investment you make mainly if you buy a camper

13
00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:39.424
A regular car too

14
00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:41.472
So they are preparing

15
00:00:41.728 --> 00:00:42.496
Today

16
00:00:43.264 --> 00:00:47.104
But the movie you will see today is based on

17
00:00:47.616 --> 00:00:49.408
I have received some requests

18
00:00:49.664 --> 00:00:51.968
About wanting to see some backstage

19
00:00:52.224 --> 00:00:54.016
Yes you who have been on the channel

20
00:00:54.528 --> 00:00:55.552
You know that I

21
00:00:55.808 --> 00:00:59.648
Not only deal with motorhomes like a hobby but I

22
00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:03.232
Then also on stage and works as an actor producer

23
00:01:03.488 --> 00:01:04.000

And I have played murder mystery throughout the fall and we will continue in the spring

26
00:01:12.192 --> 00:01:16.032
I got one on instagram because it was i got a little message about

27
00:01:16.544 --> 00:01:19.616
Wouldn't we be able to see a little neighbor what it looks like in castles

28
00:01:19.872 --> 00:01:20.640
On Kalmar

29
00:01:20.896 --> 00:01:24.480
A little backstage above do before the show

30
00:01:24.992 --> 00:01:27.040
What looks like and so on and

31
00:01:27.808 --> 00:01:29.600
I did like this that I

32
00:01:29.856 --> 00:01:35.232
I took my camera and then I told the ensemble that we would make a little movie about this

33
00:01:35.744 --> 00:01:39.840
And they took on the task with bravur

34
00:01:40.352 --> 00:01:45.216
This camera it it brought around between the ensemble members

35
00:01:45.728 --> 00:01:50.080
I don't really know as much as has been filmed but they have

36
00:01:50.848 --> 00:01:52.640
I have filmed a great deal and

37
00:01:52.896 --> 00:01:54.432
This is completely unedited

38
00:01:54.688 --> 00:01:55.712
And

39
00:01:55.968 --> 00:01:57.760
Just assembled from the outside

40
00:01:58.272 --> 00:02:01.344
What is filmed out of the ensemble

41
00:02:01.856 --> 00:02:02.624
So

42
00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:05.440
We may well apologize if the sound is as it is

43
00:02:05.952 --> 00:02:09.536
I try to boost it as much as I can but

44
00:02:10.048 --> 00:02:13.120
But here is Iallafa ll is a movie about

45
00:02:13.632 --> 00:02:14.400
Themselves

46
00:02:14.656 --> 00:02:16.448
The murder mystery at Kalmar Castle

47
00:02:16.704 --> 00:02:18.240
Death takes command

48
00:02:19.008 --> 00:02:19.776

49
00:02:43.584 --> 00:02:46.400
So like this

57
00:03:09.184 --> 00:03:10.720
Can recommend it

58
00:03:10.976 --> 00:03:14.048
Is a good Christmas present if it is now that you

59
00:03:14.816 --> 00:03:18.656
Have a little idea to dry what to give to someone who has everything

60
00:03:18.912 --> 00:03:21.472
So it is then would it work great with

61
00:03:21.728 --> 00:03:23.776
Murder of Kalmar Castle

62
00:03:24.032 --> 00:03:26.080
And besides, it is a 3 course

63
00:03:26.336 --> 00:03:27.616

00:03:28.896 --> 00:03:29.920
Not to forget

65
00:03:30.176 --> 00:03:32.224
Good food is a really really good food

66
00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:33.248
That's how it is

67
00:03:34.272 --> 00:03:35.040
Perfect is it

68
00:03:35.552 --> 00:03:37.088
But now I will take and prepare

Time for a little to drink

80
00:04:12.672 --> 00:04:13.952
In other words

81
00:04:14.208 --> 00:04:16.512
I think you should look like this all the time

82
00:04:16.512 --> 00:04:19.833
Exactly, really my new hairstyle

83
00:04:19.833 --> 00:04:21.077

Now I will take them out now I will have to attract my little pile

85
00:04:27.519 --> 00:04:30.079
We may hope that the next murder mystery that you may have these left

00:04:52.607 --> 00:04:54.143
If you look at, you look at.

00:04:54.399 --> 00:04:55.423
Here you stand and are looking

94
00:04:55.935 --> 00:04:57.983
Seeking for the meaning of life

95
00:04:58.495 --> 00:05:00.543
Far down in a box

96
00:05:00.728 --> 00:05:03.576
What is it I have Joesfine, is that the one I have, huh?

97
00:05:04.162 --> 00:05:05.169

Yeah that looks good

101
00:05:13.831 --> 00:05:18.510
What is going there is the tray and the other glasses

102
00:05:20.255 --> 00:05:23.071

00:05:27.877 --> 00:05:29.658
This should be in the gray hall

105
00:05:30.239 --> 00:05:34.151
Yeah, it should stand on the cabinet

106
00:05:34.507 --> 00:05:35.275
Where

107
00:05:35.460 --> 00:05:37.697
It's damn dangerous ......

108
00:05:38.175 --> 00:05:39.199
Where should it stand somewhere

109
00:05:40.900 --> 00:05:42.406
Uhhh ...

110
00:05:43.001 --> 00:05:46.975
I can accompany you so I will show you

111
00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:49.095
So

00:05:49.285 --> 00:05:50.218
Perfect

113
00:05:51.743 --> 00:05:53.023
Cannon

00:05:53.279 --> 00:05:59.423
We go on into the gray hall, precisely the one it will stand up there

115
00:05:59.679 --> 00:06:01.727
But you who are tall and stately

116
00:06:02.129 --> 00:06:05.773
There is no inner gauge in the cabinet

117
00:06:08.383 --> 00:06:10.315
Okay

118
00:06:12.735 --> 00:06:15.039

119
00:06:15.551 --> 00:06:16.063

00:06:22.719 --> 00:06:24.351
Povel Ramel

123
00:06:24.536 --> 00:06:27.610
Lotta Rammel, I've been to a party there ....

124
00:06:31.935 --> 00:06:32.763
VA

125
00:06:32.763 --> 00:06:33.716
Do you have some apple juice

126
00:06:33.716 --> 00:06:34.290
No

127
00:06:35.217 --> 00:06:37.860
Is it up in the Kuretornet

128
00:06:39.103 --> 00:06:42.000
What happened to Povel Ramel.

129
00:06:42.309 --> 00:06:47.841
Well, there was a friend who knew her, I didn't know her ....

130
00:06:49.108 --> 00:06:54.000
And when we got in there, a man suddenly came into a ...

131
00:06:54.207 --> 00:06:59.362
Morning Rock .... It's Povel Ramel

132
00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:04.045
He must have been the Thomas Di Living time

133
00:07:04.261 --> 00:07:06.989
Hello Hi, then he just goes on .....

134
00:07:10.134 --> 00:07:12.438

00:07:12.438 --> 00:07:14.137
Yes, it works well there.

136
00:07:18.434 --> 00:07:21.433
Yes, it was Povel Ramel .....

137
00:07:22.298 --> 00:07:24.187
We will see what happens in here then.

138
00:07:25.202 --> 00:07:32.787
(Waffle)

139
00:07:33.346 --> 00:07:35.790
Are it you who spinn my socks

140
00:07:35.790 --> 00:07:36.599

Chairs ... the socks are left .....

142
00:07:42.079 --> 00:07:43.103
What is happening here now

143
00:07:44.383 --> 00:07:51.857
Here are lots of secrets the secret shrine ... Well it wasn't .... it was a bomb attack ...

144
00:07:56.400 --> 00:08:00.798
(Ticking sound)

145
00:08:02.701 --> 00:08:05.261
The voltage increases

146
00:08:24.239 --> 00:08:29.432
Someone can help me move the cords ...

147
00:08:30.328 --> 00:08:31.630
I fill this with something drinkable

148
00:08:33.791 --> 00:08:39.935
I keep up

149
00:09:05.814 --> 00:09:10.151
Now let's see here ...

150
00:09:21.919 --> 00:09:24.707
What playground we got today ...

151
00:09:25.004 --> 00:09:27.820
Huge

152
00:09:35.743 --> 00:09:38.303
Hubertus is not a man who takes a lot of space on this earth

153
00:09:38.894 --> 00:09:41.887
No, a very modest character

154
00:09:43.940 --> 00:09:46.530
Nice and kind

155
00:09:49.823 --> 00:09:53.151
Something like that, then they'll be backwards

156
00:09:55.967 --> 00:09:58.015
Tongue as lead

157
00:10:03.135 --> 00:10:06.719
It is noticeable that Daniel is used to hard body work

158
00:10:09.612 --> 00:10:12.691
So it is in the arm ... it might not know about ...

159
00:10:13.631 --> 00:10:14.143
No

160
00:10:14.399 --> 00:10:15.935
Do you have anything else

161
00:10:16.191 --> 00:10:19.263
Type of body work

162
00:10:19.519 --> 00:10:24.000
Yes it is the more sweaty bodies

163
00:10:24.616 --> 00:10:28.479
Candis sugar is in place.
 Apple juice we have to fill in

164
00:10:29.629 --> 00:10:33.138
The books are in place.
 and Götes is in place, that's the most important thing

165
00:10:34.879 --> 00:10:37.147
Who is this goth

166
00:10:37.889 --> 00:10:39.814
The suffering of young Werther ....

167
00:10:40.124 --> 00:10:41.520
Can't you read something

168
00:10:42.215 --> 00:10:46.134
I can give you today's word ...

169
00:10:47.935 --> 00:10:53.823
Today's word eating from Götes.
 It is nothing.
 As much as it is in Eugenia's head.

170
00:10:55.867 --> 00:10:57.553
So wicked is hubertus

171
00:10:58.943 --> 00:11:01.759

00:12:55.935 --> 00:12:57.873
Oh, the clothes have come in too

191
00:13:06.148 --> 00:13:07.525
You're lying to me

192
00:13:07.525 --> 00:13:09.737
No, would never do

193
00:13:15.006 --> 00:13:20.275
I am a very early gentleman, you should remember.

194
00:13:38.622 --> 00:13:39.480
(Shot)

195
00:13:39.480 --> 00:13:41.680
A shot, who was the one who shot

196
00:13:56.856 --> 00:13:59.484
What is that sound.
 It sounds like a clock.

197
00:14:01.528 --> 00:14:04.530
Mushroom salad.
 You get to taste

198
00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:09.232
I feel that you can feel very strange.

199
00:14:10.586 --> 00:14:14.227
So it is similar to what the Aztecs call Teonanacatl.

200
00:14:14.481 --> 00:14:16.250
Oh, so you can mushrooms

201
00:14:16.466 --> 00:14:18.000
No, I know nothing.

202
00:14:19.307 --> 00:14:19.965
Neither do I.

203
00:14:22.204 --> 00:14:25.803
It is similar to my father brought with her from his travels in South America.
 Albert's death, what does Gür think about it

204
00:14:26.815 --> 00:14:29.845
Albert's death, what do gur think about it

205
00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:33.374
Albert's mouth will remain closed for all time, and that is good.

206
00:14:33.874 --> 00:14:35.672
Hm, wonder what that is too button

207
00:14:36.799 --> 00:14:43.919
Ha, it's ticking.
 How fun.
 A bomb.
 Think about the father of it.

208
00:14:44.479 --> 00:14:47.551
Why did Albert Maud give a bomb

209
00:14:47.807 --> 00:14:49.778
He didn't.

210
00:14:49.778 --> 00:14:53.523
I found it in his military trunk when he came morning.

211
00:14:53.523 --> 00:14:58.350
He always brought presents with me, so I peeked in his bag ....

212
00:14:58.535 --> 00:15:02.375
Found this one and knew it must be to me

213
00:15:03.935 --> 00:15:09.183
You are not kind.
 These tablets make me weak and insane and forgetful.

214
00:15:10.088 --> 00:15:12.021
I forget everything after taking them.

215
00:15:12.021 --> 00:15:17.699
Hubertus no, so yes my friend.
 You just think so.
 Give me the gun.

216
00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:20.448
I don't think you know how to handle a gun.

217
00:15:21.376 --> 00:15:25.121
Suddenly I hear a huge bang, and reflexively I get up ...

218
00:15:25.121 --> 00:15:26.301
Bertil's death.

219
00:15:26.301 --> 00:15:27.048
Yes.

220
00:15:28.420 --> 00:15:30.225
But how did Albert get on you

221
00:15:30.815 --> 00:15:33.424
I turned around, and behind me was Albert.

222
00:15:34.735 --> 00:15:36.046
Revealed

223
00:15:37.168 --> 00:15:39.403
But, this was two years ago.

224
00:15:39.775 --> 00:15:41.055
How can Daniel still remain in the military

225
00:15:46.943 --> 00:15:49.499
Albert came walking from Bertil's direction ....

226
00:15:49.870 --> 00:15:51.668
and in his hand he held

227
00:15:51.668 --> 00:15:55.908
The rise.
 The bombing staircase.
 He replaced it

228
00:15:56.065 --> 00:15:59.751
Yes, and I stood with my pants down, and Albert glowed like a mood.

229
00:15:59.751 --> 00:16:03.558
You will be arched, what the only thing he got out.

230
00:16:03.558 --> 00:16:06.000
And I guess you said the same thing back.

231
00:16:06.820 --> 00:16:08.356
Five

232
00:16:09.321 --> 00:16:11.615
Five what is Hubertus talking about?

233
00:16:11.615 --> 00:16:13.599
But it was well five children

234
00:16:14.079 --> 00:16:15.915
Give me some must ....

235
00:16:16.255 --> 00:16:18.495
Now I have to think clearly ... five ...

236
00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:24.931
Well, the brother of love

237
00:16:25.271 --> 00:16:25.840
Five

238
00:16:26.367 --> 00:16:30.471
Uhhhh ... you have to help me count here now

239
00:16:30.471 --> 00:16:35.845
First came Eugenia.
 A day of sorrow

240
00:16:35.845 --> 00:16:38.855
I think it is she who killed Albert.

241
00:16:39.924 --> 00:16:40.591
Why

242
00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:46.609
Sorry, i mean, i hope she who killed albert

243
00:16:46.958 --> 00:16:49.331
no no

244
00:16:49.875 --> 00:16:53.510
Not any of the four children are guilty.

245
00:16:54.015 --> 00:16:55.039
Five

246
00:16:58.672 --> 00:16:59.956
A gun give me it!

247
00:17:00.722 --> 00:17:02.292
What is this doing

248
00:17:03.595 --> 00:17:05.733
Do not know.
 I haven't seen it before

249
00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:06.918
It smells of gunpowder.

250
00:17:06.918 --> 00:17:09.458
It does not at all it is not mine.

251
00:17:09.458 --> 00:17:10.793
I've never seen it before.

252
00:17:11.167 --> 00:17:14.654
Why is there a recently fired gun in your bag

253
00:17:14.999 --> 00:17:18.495
I don't know ... it must have ...

254
00:17:18.495 --> 00:17:21.601
You murdered Albert.
 You shot him.

255
00:17:22.491 --> 00:17:26.255
Why would I have killed Albert

256
00:17:26.859 --> 00:17:29.441
Albert was shot.

257
00:17:29.626 --> 00:17:32.290
How should you explain it to the county governor

258
00:17:35.487 --> 00:17:37.686
Well, eugenia .....

259
00:17:38.047 --> 00:17:39.651
Why do you have ...

260
00:17:39.898 --> 00:17:42.159
Uh, wait now.
 Sit down.

261
00:17:42.399 --> 00:17:47.419
Yes, my mother always said that women are cunning than skator.

262
00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:48.885
Skator

263
00:17:49.055 --> 00:17:53.151
Empty your bag on contents, scary, unpleasant skates.

264
00:17:54.000 --> 00:17:55.839
Freja, stop.

265
00:17:56.389 --> 00:17:58.546
See, how easily the county governor got your balance.

266
00:17:59.414 --> 00:18:01.797
You must be prepared, if you are now as innocent as you say.

267
00:18:02.367 --> 00:18:06.463
Running around with the murder weapon requires you to think before you answer.

268
00:18:07.877 --> 00:18:11.548
So, come so we have interrogation with the county governor.

269
00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:14.601
You don't have your tablets, then Wednesday morning.

270
00:18:14.941 --> 00:18:18.408
It's dangerous for you, Hubertus.
 You can die from heart attack

271
00:18:18.686 --> 00:18:21.411
But, I get so lethargic in the head of them.

272
00:18:23.062 --> 00:18:27.742
No, no, you will not be lethargic.
 You become sharply thought like a herring.

273
00:18:28.398 --> 00:18:33.042
Herring.
 Herring is one of the most common fish varieties.

274
00:18:33.227 --> 00:18:35.705
It lives on both sides of the Atlantic ....

275
00:18:36.516 --> 00:18:39.305
Empty your bag on contents, aircraft.

276
00:18:40.592 --> 00:18:46.176
You think you can fly, but you are just a stupid ostrich trying to hide what you have.

277
00:18:51.316 --> 00:18:54.515
Then we are done how does it feel Madde

278
00:18:54.793 --> 00:18:57.302
Well then, it feels a bit sad

279
00:18:57.580 --> 00:18:59.317
It is the last for the fall

280
00:18:59.614 --> 00:19:00.735
But we got back

281
00:19:01.547 --> 00:19:03.039
Yeah right when when we'll be back

282
00:19:03.295 --> 00:19:07.461
I can't date but it's January

283
00:19:07.615 --> 00:19:08.300
Fifteenth

284
00:19:08.300 --> 00:19:09.727
Fifteenth January

285
00:19:10.207 --> 00:19:14.303
Then we are back.
 But now we'll pick down everything

286
00:19:14.559 --> 00:19:20.703
It will be Christmas market at the castle and it will be Christmas table

287
00:19:20.959 --> 00:19:23.007
What will it be for this castle now

288
00:19:23.263 --> 00:19:25.823
We will bubble down as we called

289
00:19:28.127 --> 00:19:29.663
You may keep up with simply

290
00:19:36.063 --> 00:19:36.831
Wow

291
00:19:38.173 --> 00:19:39.506
Feels good

292
00:19:39.506 --> 00:19:41.057
Yes, what is this ....

293
00:19:46.559 --> 00:19:49.375
Yes, you pick down the lights yes, so good

294
00:19:49.375 --> 00:19:50.802
But the barn walls

295
00:19:51.679 --> 00:19:53.727
Good you are

296
00:19:53.983 --> 00:19:57.311
I have learned all terms

297
00:20:03.455 --> 00:20:06.783
God what it was removed here then

298
00:20:08.319 --> 00:20:10.879
There stands some disk to be washed

299
00:20:11.135 --> 00:20:13.183
I'll leave

300
00:20:14.975 --> 00:20:17.279
Stuff

301
00:20:24.447 --> 00:20:30.591
Now we come to the secret area that visitors are not allowed to come to when you are at the castle

302
00:20:31.359 --> 00:20:33.919
It is ... what is it called the cure tower ...

303
00:20:34.197 --> 00:20:34.918
Base

304
00:20:35.199 --> 00:20:36.479
No it's not base

305
00:20:36.991 --> 00:20:39.295
The tower, the tower is this

306
00:20:39.551 --> 00:20:41.087
It is the tower that one can see

307
00:20:41.343 --> 00:20:43.647
The flag it will with home ...

308
00:20:45.439 --> 00:20:49.023
Yes it works

309
00:20:49.535 --> 00:20:51.641
What should I place these lights

310
00:20:51.839 --> 00:20:52.863
We don't use it

311
00:20:53.018 --> 00:20:54.375
Does someone use it

312
00:20:54.375 --> 00:20:56.111
Well, it's Gurs Rucksack

313
00:20:57.855 --> 00:20:59.599
But should everything be here or there

314
00:21:00.031 --> 00:21:00.543
Here

315
00:21:01.055 --> 00:21:02.847
No, there does not have to scoop it up

316
00:21:03.876 --> 00:21:06.000
Yes yes but is it the box to the lights

317
00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:07.056
Yes use it

318
00:21:11.295 --> 00:21:13.087
Hello

319
00:21:17.536 --> 00:21:20.123
Did you get with your Åsa up too or

320
00:21:20.123 --> 00:21:21.534
I haven't seen Åsa

321
00:21:24.352 --> 00:21:29.472
I take home my jug and the two mugs

322
00:21:31.327 --> 00:21:32.224
Hello

323
00:21:43.479 --> 00:21:44.720
We are visible and heard

324
00:21:45.001 --> 00:21:48.672
And when do we appear yes we can see the eighth

325
00:21:48.928 --> 00:21:50.732
Then we'll scratch

326
00:21:50.732 --> 00:21:52.128
But when do we have performance

327
00:21:52.317 --> 00:21:53.446
The 15th

328
00:21:54.686 --> 00:21:56.173
January 15

329
00:21:56.864 --> 00:21:57.632
Great

330
00:21:58.899 --> 00:22:08.630
(Waffle)

331
00:22:10.004 --> 00:22:11.340
Hello

332
00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:17.647
(Waffle)

333
00:22:18.166 --> 00:22:20.879
What did you do now

334
00:22:20.879 --> 00:22:23.264
What is not visible is not there

335
00:22:23.759 --> 00:22:26.924
(Laugh)

336
00:22:27.627 --> 00:22:29.285
Away

337
00:22:29.598 --> 00:22:34.055
(Laugh)

338
00:22:36.544 --> 00:22:38.080
What is the pill to put in

339
00:22:40.910 --> 00:22:42.811
Pill pills

340
00:22:46.528 --> 00:22:47.040
Well

341
00:22:53.023 --> 00:22:55.152
What did you say Madde

342
00:22:55.942 --> 00:22:56.732
Ghosts

343
00:22:56.732 --> 00:22:58.623
Is it ghosts here

344
00:23:00.352 --> 00:23:02.144
You feel like that

345
00:23:05.005 --> 00:23:07.123
Do you feel it is ghosts here

346
00:23:07.467 --> 00:23:08.975
No

347
00:23:13.408 --> 00:23:14.719
Should it be left or

348
00:23:14.719 --> 00:23:16.719
Although Eugenia looks like a ghost

349
00:23:18.784 --> 00:23:19.676
I do not think so

350
00:23:20.055 --> 00:23:22.359
Gur shall talk too much

351
00:23:23.648 --> 00:23:29.792
Here then, we should try to get down all our stuff now before we should ....

352
00:23:32.636 --> 00:23:33.918
.... have some break

353
00:23:34.660 --> 00:23:37.520
Whose is it that Pippi's Rucksack

354
00:23:38.240 --> 00:23:44.384
It's Gur's jacket.
 It's a little candy sugar.
 We can shut it down.

355
00:23:46.944 --> 00:23:47.456
Hello

356
00:23:47.968 --> 00:23:50.272
What do you come up with for something exciting

357
00:23:54.112 --> 00:23:56.928
A table

358
00:23:59.193 --> 00:24:01.811
Chair

359
00:24:08.704 --> 00:24:14.848
Yes there look.
 Can the sir sit down

360
00:24:18.688 --> 00:24:19.200
No clue

361
00:24:19.456 --> 00:24:21.760
This is the Kuretornet

362
00:24:22.016 --> 00:24:24.832
I have never been up here now and it might be ....

363
00:24:25.088 --> 00:24:27.904
Lucky we are not up there and play

364
00:24:28.416 --> 00:24:30.720
Then maybe you can happen to a murder for real

365
00:24:32.000 --> 00:24:33.792
What do I know

366
00:24:34.816 --> 00:24:35.328
Are you tired

367
00:24:35.483 --> 00:24:35.983
Yes a little

368
00:24:40.108 --> 00:24:44.233
We are in the process of packing our stuff together

369
00:24:45.969 --> 00:24:48.385
It's not so much stuff here

370
00:24:48.385 --> 00:24:51.110
We are in the process of packing our stuff together

371
00:24:53.552 --> 00:24:58.831
We are ready for the fall.
