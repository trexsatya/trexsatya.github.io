1
00:00:09.040 --> 00:00:14.400
--Ulf, do you have to eat in bed?
 -I'm hungry.

2
00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:19.280
But crab ...?

3
00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:46.520
Tord fills evenly on Friday.
 I have started a collection for a gift.

4
00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:52.880
We put three bucks per person.

5
00:01:53.880 --> 00:02:01.880
It is much nicer with string panties, and you do not have the edge of faith.

6
00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:08.360
It is very sexy with string, but Kristina does not like it.

7
00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:15.320
"It's not nice, it's uncomfortable."
 I think you feel fresh.

8
00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:27.400
Well you, it's a party in my cap.

9
00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:37.800
Party.

10
00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:02.160
-Do you work here?
 -No.

11
00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:07.480
- I will not buy anything.
 -It's not that easy.

12
00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:11.400
I have bought some meat and vegetables.

13
00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:15.320
- I take your basket ... - no!

14
00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:18.480
What is your boss called?!

15
00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:31.640
-Whats happening here?
 That is my basket.
 - No, you have your own.

16
00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:36.520
It is full of onions.
 I don't want onions.

17
00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:41.720
- Then you have to put it back yourself.
 -Yes exactly.

18
00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:44.880
These are my goods.

19
00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:52.160
Have you paid for them?
 It is the one who pays the goods that gets them.

20
00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:56.560
This is ...

21
00:03:56.720 --> 00:04:01.600
Okay.
 You get them.
 Congratulations!
 Damn...

22
00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:07.480
- The worst what he got angry.
 –445 kr.

23
00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:10.000
SEK 445

24
00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:15.840
Excuse me!
 This was going crazy.
 This is your goods.

25
00:04:18.640 --> 00:04:21.160
Yes exactly.

26
00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:26.480
You are welcome.
 - Damn...

27
00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:37.880
-I'm sorry.
 Can you forgive me?
 - I thought it was hidden camera.

28
00:04:38.040 --> 00:04:41.280
–20 kr.
 - There was a difference.

29
00:04:41.440 --> 00:04:46.000
- Can't I have a hug?
 -No.

30
00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:50.480
So.

31
00:04:54.520 --> 00:05:00.080
- Did it go good to shop?
 - I've been shopping since I was ten years old!

32
00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:06.600
- You bought a lot of onions.
 - It was well on the list.

33
00:05:06.760 --> 00:05:09.760
It's just onions.

34
00:05:11.760 --> 00:05:14.760
YES!
 Onions are good!

35
00:05:18.280 --> 00:05:21.480
What a fucking coffee!

36
00:05:21.640 --> 00:05:27.600
Why did you become a police officer?
 You are not directly built as a police officer.

37
00:05:28.680 --> 00:05:34.880
You are a girl, so it can't be easy to throw through the system.

38
00:05:35.040 --> 00:05:40.880
-I was a course at the Polish Academy.
 - Yes, but why did you become a police officer?

39
00:05:41.040 --> 00:05:47.000
I wanted to make an effort.
 I have a high moral perception -

40
00:05:47.160 --> 00:05:54.800
- And stable psyche.
 Mom and Dad were police officers and grandfather were police chief.

41
00:05:54.960 --> 00:05:59.760
-And you?
 - I didn't get into the hairdressing line.

42
00:06:22.600 --> 00:06:26.200
No, now I break the ice!

43
00:06:26.360 --> 00:06:32.600
We have been riding this bus together for several years ...

44
00:06:32.760 --> 00:06:39.280
I have been riding this bus for six years and I just want to say that ...

45
00:06:39.440 --> 00:06:43.560
... My name is Marit.
 Hello!

46
00:06:44.720 --> 00:06:48.440
-Hello!
 What's your name?
 - Bengt.

47
00:06:48.600 --> 00:06:53.840
I recognize you.
 We have gone here every morning.
 Hello!

48
00:06:54.880 --> 00:06:58.160
Hey what's your name?

49
00:06:58.320 --> 00:07:02.600
Yes, my name is Marit anyway.
 Hello!

50
00:07:05.880 --> 00:07:12.600
I think you should talk to each other.
 - Or how, Bengt?

51
00:07:12.760 --> 00:07:19.000
We are quite close to each other because we go the bus every day.

52
00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:25.640
Maybe we should play a game?
 It usually lightens up.

53
00:07:27.520 --> 00:07:33.800
What should we play ...?
 The whisper, maybe?
 Surely everyone can?

54
00:07:34.800 --> 00:07:39.280
Then I whispers something to you, Bengt.

55
00:07:39.440 --> 00:07:43.320
What should I whisper ... yes!

56
00:07:47.080 --> 00:07:52.800
-I can not hear what you're saying.
 - Morning time has gold in Mund ... no!

57
00:07:52.960 --> 00:07:58.760
No, what a crazy!
 Now I said out loud what to whisper.

58
00:08:01.280 --> 00:08:06.600
Maybe we should sing something instead?
 What do you say about it?

59
00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:50.600
The English fleet has been sifted at Vinga

60
00:08:50.760 --> 00:08:54.560
Oh Boy, Oh Boy, Oh Boy!

61
00:08:54.720 --> 00:08:58.200
A thousand little sailors that we are going to expose

62
00:08:58.360 --> 00:09:01.720
Oh Boy, Oh Boy, Oh Boy!

63
00:09:01.880 --> 00:09:08.200
Then we will be delighted at Liseberg with Charlie, Pete and Tom ...

64
00:09:30.680 --> 00:09:33.320
Hello Hello!

65
00:09:33.480 --> 00:09:37.960
What it was empty on the bus today.

66
00:10:14.920 --> 00:10:16.920
Tut!

67
00:10:17.080 --> 00:10:21.080
-What are you doing?
 - I honed.

68
00:10:21.240 --> 00:10:25.240
- What are you on your head?
 - A strut.

69
00:10:25.400 --> 00:10:30.200
- Why do you have a strut on your head?
 - I thought of having fun.

70
00:10:30.360 --> 00:10:35.360
- It wasn't fun.
 -No...

71
00:10:35.520 --> 00:10:40.600
- Then I'll take it off.
 -Yes do it.

72
00:10:41.920 --> 00:10:46.800
- It got a little wrong, Carita.
 - Yes, it was.

73
00:10:47.800 --> 00:10:52.560
- Then I don't bring this up either?
 -No.

74
00:10:57.720 --> 00:11:00.840
Then I don't.

75
00:11:17.840 --> 00:11:19.840
-Hello.
 -Hello.

76
00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:25.360
- Do you want to talk about the meaning of life?
 - It only takes a minute.

77
00:11:25.520 --> 00:11:31.040
- We are envoy from a higher power.
 - We have a message to you.

78
00:11:31.200 --> 00:11:34.200
No thanks.
 I'm not interested.

79
00:11:34.360 --> 00:11:40.920
We want to testify to a savior who can do wonders.
 His name is Satan.

80
00:11:41.080 --> 00:11:46.800
We are from the Swedish Satanist Church and you will soon switch to us.

81
00:11:46.960 --> 00:11:49.000
No thanks.

82
00:11:49.160 --> 00:11:55.680
We respect it, but give you this brochure in four -color pressure.

83
00:11:56.760 --> 00:11:59.880
He knows where you live.

84
00:12:35.960 --> 00:12:40.920
Satan, Satan, Satan

85
00:12:42.160 --> 00:12:46.200
I want to elevate your name

86
00:12:47.280 --> 00:12:53.800
You are the king of the dark you are the prince of my life

87
00:12:56.240 --> 00:13:02.920
You are the king of the dark you are the prince of my life

88
00:13:25.560 --> 00:13:32.760
It started with ... shortness of breath, although I have learned to handle it.

89
00:13:33.760 --> 00:13:39.400
The worst is the migraine.
 It can last two days in a row.

90
00:13:41.880 --> 00:13:45.760
I believe that confrontation therapy -

91
00:13:45.920 --> 00:13:51.680
- Is the best way for you to avoid the symptoms.

92
00:13:51.840 --> 00:13:56.840
Yes ... it's silly, but I have itching too.

93
00:13:57.000 --> 00:14:02.520
Nothing is silly here.
 We all have our phobias.

94
00:14:02.680 --> 00:14:06.160
You can't have it like this.

95
00:14:07.960 --> 00:14:11.080
Do you feel prepared?

96
00:14:14.320 --> 00:14:18.080
Can we bring in the FOBI subject?

97
00:14:18.240 --> 00:14:20.240
Yes.

98
00:14:27.360 --> 00:14:30.480
You can look at him.

99
00:14:31.560 --> 00:14:35.960
- A beer would be good!
 - Now it goes too fast!

100
00:14:36.120 --> 00:14:39.120
Where is the hockey?

101
00:14:39.280 --> 00:14:42.360
Calm down, calm!
 He is still in the cage.

102
00:14:42.520 --> 00:14:49.320
I came to think of a funny story.
 It was a Norwegian ...

103
00:14:50.440 --> 00:14:55.280
You should travel away for a couple of weeks?
 Sin!

104
00:14:55.440 --> 00:15:02.600
I am looking for a substitute.
 It is difficult to find one with your skills.

105
00:15:02.760 --> 00:15:08.280
-I have a suggestion.
 Here is Koko.
 - A monkey, I see.

106
00:15:08.440 --> 00:15:14.360
A chimpanzee.
 He can take over your job without any notice.

107
00:15:14.520 --> 00:15:19.800
- I make my job better than a monkey.
 - It may stand for you.

108
00:15:19.960 --> 00:15:25.680
Here is Coconut CV.
 Nice testimonials from both Skansen and Kolmården ...

109
00:15:25.840 --> 00:15:31.960
- It's an unusually intelligent monkey?
 - No, it's a regular monkey ...

110
00:15:32.120 --> 00:15:37.720
... but he is younger than you, so he learns to run about you.

111
00:15:37.880 --> 00:15:44.000
- You have no other options?
 - Yes - this plant.

112
00:15:45.680 --> 00:15:50.760
- He can achieve the same results.
 - You think that?

113
00:15:51.760 --> 00:15:58.360
You are more mobile, but when it comes to intelligence he gives you a match.

114
00:15:58.520 --> 00:16:05.200
We would do a market analysis.
 You have apparently been replaced.

115
00:16:05.360 --> 00:16:11.880
I have got a better employee.
 I'm going to work with this cup.

116
00:16:12.040 --> 00:16:16.120
Okay.
 Then we will leave you in peace.

117
00:16:17.120 --> 00:16:20.480
I'll give you a log-in.

118
00:16:23.080 --> 00:16:26.120
Shall we continue?

119
00:16:27.480 --> 00:16:31.080
Should we try to release him?

120
00:16:34.720 --> 00:16:37.840
-No.
 - We try.

121
00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:42.160
Ugh, I don't know ... if I'm ready.

122
00:16:42.320 --> 00:16:46.560
- We make a small attempt, just.
 -Okay.

123
00:17:03.920 --> 00:17:06.440
Hm Hm Hm ...

124
00:17:06.600 --> 00:17:10.120
You didn't say he would hum!

125
00:17:12.920 --> 00:17:17.920
Do you think you can say something to him?

126
00:17:24.800 --> 00:17:27.520
Stop humming!

127
00:17:27.680 --> 00:17:32.280
I remember when my dad picked up the boat ...

128
00:17:32.440 --> 00:17:37.760
It was a holiday for us young.
 We had a green boat.

129
00:17:52.480 --> 00:17:57.680
Military service - or lump as one often says -

130
00:17:57.840 --> 00:18:02.360
- Has all we will be able to do together.

131
00:18:02.520 --> 00:18:06.000
This is where we guys become men.

132
00:18:06.160 --> 00:18:09.960
It is a hard and demanding time -

133
00:18:10.120 --> 00:18:16.480
- But also a period filled with happy laughter and male community.

134
00:18:16.640 --> 00:18:22.280
The humor on the door is known for its must and burlesque tone ...

135
00:18:23.080 --> 00:18:27.520
... I understand.

136
00:18:27.680 --> 00:18:33.360
But the purpose of the lump is to prepare us men for war.

137
00:18:33.520 --> 00:18:36.520
War is a hell -

138
00:18:36.680 --> 00:18:43.560
- So we were going to illustrate what you can be exposed to on the battlefield.

139
00:19:00.880 --> 00:19:03.960
Rifle shot

140
00:19:06.880 --> 00:19:13.240
- Set, soldier!
 The enemy is sifted.
 - The Russians come from all directions.

141
00:19:13.400 --> 00:19:18.400
You have to fight for the motherland!
 War for the crown!

142
00:19:18.560 --> 00:19:21.840
POP MUSIC

143
00:19:24.520 --> 00:19:29.520
It's an old band ... but this is how it can be.

144
00:19:33.160 --> 00:19:38.040
- River, we pray for the food first.
 -Sorry.

145
00:19:49.440 --> 00:19:53.120
So!
 Now it will be good with sausages.

146
00:19:55.000 --> 00:20:00.760
You should feel what it is like to be exposed to a grenade attack.

147
00:20:04.400 --> 00:20:09.240
- Inserting grenade!
 - It's the most dangerous bombs!

148
00:20:09.400 --> 00:20:13.840
- Duck, soldier!
 - It's fire and powder!

149
00:20:17.320 --> 00:20:24.440
They write a lot about people who make class trips, but never where they travel.

150
00:20:24.600 --> 00:20:30.840
I've made a shit cool class trip.
 At nine I was in Sala silver mine.

151
00:20:33.800 --> 00:20:40.520
It is quiet in the field today.
 We have to sneak so the Germans don't see us.

152
00:20:42.440 --> 00:20:47.880
Soldier!
 Now I see the goal for our mission - "Örnnästet".

153
00:20:48.040 --> 00:20:53.640
- There is the secret Nazi gold hidden.
 -Fast!
 Jump into the jeep.

154
00:20:55.400 --> 00:21:00.720
-Wait for me!
 I sit down.
 -Okay, now we drive.

155
00:21:17.240 --> 00:21:22.080
There has been a lot of violence today-

156
00:21:22.240 --> 00:21:27.280
- But in peacetime, life on the door can be cozy.

157
00:21:27.440 --> 00:21:33.240
We are going to cut with a game that is very popular in the lump.

158
00:21:33.400 --> 00:21:37.560
- Torbjörn, you bought a cinnamon bun?
 -Yes.

159
00:21:40.840 --> 00:21:46.280
If everyone comes here we will be in a ring around the bun.

160
00:21:50.600 --> 00:21:53.560
Welcome!

161
00:22:00.520 --> 00:22:07.280
I heard that you should call the man's genitals the "flute" in front of children.

162
00:22:07.440 --> 00:22:13.480
Should you then say that you play a cumbling in the Municipal Music School?

163
00:22:32.320 --> 00:22:36.480
Hello!
 Hello.

164
00:22:36.640 --> 00:22:42.520
Hey.
 Everything about food recommended this - Italian.

165
00:22:42.680 --> 00:22:45.760
-Exciting.
 -Hello!

166
00:22:45.920 --> 00:22:49.400
- Don't Jenny come with you?
 -No...

167
00:22:49.560 --> 00:22:54.800

- He is a foreigner.

171
00:23:08.520 --> 00:23:15.520
It is so hard if he cannot Swedish.
 Then everyone can speak English.

172
00:23:16.520 --> 00:23:19.520
You come?
 Good!
 Hello.

173
00:23:20.520 --> 00:23:26.120

174
00:23:26.280 --> 00:23:29.920
- Danish?
 - Yes, he's Danish.

175
00:23:30.080 --> 00:23:35.240
Is he from Denmark?
 It's a difference!

00:23:35.400 --> 00:23:38.760
I'm basically Danish.
 Tuborg!

177

 - Yeah.

180
00:24:02.760 --> 00:24:05.840

 - Bagarn here.

181

-That is correct.
 -Roger.

184
00:24:19.440 --> 00:24:23.240
-Over and out.
 -Over and out.

185
00:24:25.040 --> 00:24:30.600
Why don't you use the usual codes?
 Is traffic intercepted?

186
00:24:30.760 --> 00:24:34.000
Yes, it's kind of ... eavesdropped.

187
00:24:34.160 --> 00:24:39.600
- A calzone.
 You are welcome.
 -Thanks!
 It went away.

188
00:24:40.680 --> 00:24:43.720
Can you look yourself for a while?

189
00:24:47.080 --> 00:24:51.120
- This was delicious!
 -Yes indeed.

190
00:24:51.280 --> 00:24:57.000
- Prosciutto we spoke in Italy.

Mads and I are going to drink old Danish!

197
00:25:31.160 --> 00:25:36.640
- Don't we have old Danish?
 - No, but stuff like that green ...

198
00:25:36.800 --> 00:25:42.080
- Green Tuborg, Mads!
 Hvergang!
 - No, Midori is called.

199
00:25:42.240 --> 00:25:47.120
It's a melon liqueur.
 - You bought it.

200
00:25:47.280 --> 00:25:53.080
I haven't bought any melon liqueur.
 It was you - not yes!
