1
00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:22.440
But God, of course, they sit there now that I couldn't fix myself.

2
00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:25.680
Oh my God.
 -Come again, I can.

3
00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:30.360
I don't need makeup to be good looking.
 Natural Beauty.

4
00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:35.920
Okay, this is going well.
 Smile too.

5
00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:40.200
No, not so much.
 I want to seem a little difficult too.

6
00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:43.360
Why is she going like that there

7
00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:46.840
Oh.
 -She think she's so damn good looking.

8
00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:50.000
... so damn good looking, so damn good ...

9
00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:54.760
Come on, just go as usual.
 How was it you did now

10
00:00:56.320 --> 00:01:00.400
It wasn't that dangerous.
 "You worked that runway."

11
00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:06.560
God, no now I come too late ... Then everyone sees that I am unchanged!

12
00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:11.560
Hi, Freja!
 -Heh, Stina.
 I'm in a hurry.

13
00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:15.560
You look a little tired, what is the situation?
 -Good, but ...

14
00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:20.160
You had a time with me on Monday.
 We can talk now instead.

15
00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:22.040
I must go.

16
00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:24.800
Now nothing can distract me.
 God...

17
00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:38.760
He is so good looking.
 And he comes to me.

18
00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:42.600
Will he say some hell, I'm unfixed!

19
00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:47.360
He must not see me like this.
 But how can someone be so perfect

20
00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:51.920
So damn nice hair.
 Why doesn't the Finn disappear

21
00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:55.320
What is it wrong with the eyebrow

22
00:01:55.480 --> 00:01:59.960
Shit, he looks at me ... or maybe not.

23
00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:12.680
You are the nicest Gärin in town.
 -In the city?
 Not in the world?

24
00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:17.480
No, you don't understand, me ... -nähä, so I'm stupid in my head?

25
00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:21.520
No ... -Yeah, what good!
 Thanks, Schyst!

26
00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:24.080
Jasmine, don't go, we can talk.

27
00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:28.560
Hey.
 -Hello.

28
00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:32.520
I'm so ugly today.
 Damn, what I am ashamed.

29
00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:34.760
What I am ashamed.

30
00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:40.080
The lesson too ... no idea to go in now, everyone will see me.
