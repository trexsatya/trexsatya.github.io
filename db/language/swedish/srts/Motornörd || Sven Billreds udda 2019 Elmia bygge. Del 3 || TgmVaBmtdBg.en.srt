1
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:27,400
-Hello!
 Hey!

2
00:00:27,400 --> 00:00:29,640
-Now i am back.
 Yes.

3
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:35,860
-We should see how long you have come?
 There have been no huge progress.

4
00:00:35,860 --> 00:00:41,660
I have received my water cut grill in aluminum.

5
00:00:41,660 --> 00:00:44,340
And also the moldings.

6
00:00:44,340 --> 00:00:50,080
I have been able to shape the moldings and they are not finished yet but should be rounded off and sanded.

7
00:00:50,080 --> 00:00:53,880
All screws should be recessed.

8
00:00:53,880 --> 00:00:56,300
And got rolled to this.

9
00:00:56,300 --> 00:01:05,980
When it is polished on the outside, it will look like it is cast in aluminum.

10
00:01:05,980 --> 00:01:13,940
It is because it is a bit dull but then it becomes when you water cut and then it looks more real.

11
00:01:13,940 --> 00:01:17,360
-So you should polish it?
 Yes just on that surface.

12
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:20,180
Then it must be so gray inside.

13
00:01:20,180 --> 00:01:23,480
It took many hours to do but it will be good.

14
00:01:23,480 --> 00:01:25,780
There are many holes.

15
00:01:25,780 --> 00:01:29,120
Then I made a door.

16
00:01:29,120 --> 00:01:35,420
And fit in the wagon hatch and it is almost done.

17
00:01:35,420 --> 00:01:40,600
Except for it to be polished.
 It is rough -cut.

18
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:46,080
Here I did a rough ... A test polishing.

19
00:01:46,480 --> 00:01:51,160
Then I did in a different way on the other side which got much better.

20
00:01:51,160 --> 00:01:53,220
So I have to do the other side.

21
00:01:53,220 --> 00:01:57,200
Now it is water cut.

22
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:59,860
-Yes exactly.
 Now the polishing remains.

23
00:01:59,860 --> 00:02:05,340
It is very straight and nice compared to the other side.

24
00:02:05,340 --> 00:02:08,295
That part took about 14 hours to grind.

25
00:02:08,300 --> 00:02:10,780
-You're joking!??
 No it took 14 hours.

26
00:02:10,780 --> 00:02:14,540
-14 hours to grind the little triangle?
 Yes.

27
00:02:14,540 --> 00:02:22,000
It is another 5-6 hours with polishing before I finished.
 -You're crazy.

28
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:28,140
It's lucky you don't have to pay someone for that work because then the car had become really expensive.

29
00:02:28,140 --> 00:02:34,660
-It's totally crazy.
 If you add 6 hours on that page.

30
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:37,860
-Then you have 20 hours of work on the other side.
 -Yes.

31
00:02:37,860 --> 00:02:43,100
-And you should be ready before Easter ... -Yes hahaha ... that's the idea.

32
00:02:43,100 --> 00:02:48,260
I have made a door that is suspended in my own hinges.

33
00:02:48,260 --> 00:02:54,120
I cut to it so the transition is not completely straight.

34
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:57,060
I want some turn on it.

35
00:02:58,820 --> 00:03:04,660
Then I have had to weld and put in pieces to get a good fit.

36
00:03:05,180 --> 00:03:09,800
-The whole door have you built up and knocked yourself?
 Yes.

37
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:12,860
-You are good.
 Well...

38
00:03:13,420 --> 00:03:15,440
...stubborn.

39
00:03:15,740 --> 00:03:20,720
On the inside I have tried to rose polish.

40
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:23,820
The same way as the dashboard but it was difficult.

41
00:03:23,820 --> 00:03:27,340
I can't do it in the pillar drill because it gets too deep.

42
00:03:27,340 --> 00:03:31,780
So I tried by hand but it should be dressed with leather instead.

43
00:03:31,780 --> 00:03:34,820
With a compartment here in leather.

44
00:03:34,820 --> 00:03:40,240
Was how you wanted to do?
 Yes, it is difficult with rose polishing.

45
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:45,820
It is a hot thing if you have a computer that presses just as hard and has the same type of grinding.

46
00:03:45,820 --> 00:03:49,060
Then you get smooth and nice results.

47
00:03:49,100 --> 00:03:52,880
-How long did it take to make the door?
 Yes how long did it take ....

48
00:03:52,880 --> 00:03:54,840
Hmmm ...

49
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:56,840
One and a half weeks about.

50
00:03:57,240 --> 00:03:59,320
From scratch then.

51
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:03,840
Then I had to do special tools.

52
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:07,780
When I have completed the plate I put this one.

53
00:04:07,780 --> 00:04:10,380
So it stands out so much.

54
00:04:10,920 --> 00:04:15,520
Attaches it down to so it is firm.
 -Yes.

55
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:20,580
Then I knock with a plastic hammer around the tube.

56
00:04:20,580 --> 00:04:25,240
And then you get this bend down.

57
00:04:26,020 --> 00:04:30,540
-What bending do you want?
 It is partly upwards.

58
00:04:30,540 --> 00:04:34,000
And that it turns in.
 -Yeah that it swings.

59
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:40,820
When I make the other door I get to cut away the welding and turn hold so it becomes mirrored.

60
00:04:40,820 --> 00:04:45,260
Now these parts are welded in this bend.

61
00:04:45,260 --> 00:04:53,880
The door itself consists of outer skin and these two edge moldings that you can bend.

62
00:04:53,880 --> 00:04:59,560
A lower and a front piece where hinges are sitting that I had to reinforce.

63
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:03,360
And finally the inner skin on the door.

64
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:05,940
-Impressive!
 Now the hinges are in place.

65
00:05:05,940 --> 00:05:10,720
Here there should be a list that is in the height of the hinge.

66
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:15,380
A sealing strip or d-list as it is called.

67
00:05:15,380 --> 00:05:19,720
It should sit here because I want the car Vättentät.

68
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:23,240
I should be able to wash the car without the whole inside getting wet.

69
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:28,620
-Yes you could also run in the rain.
 Yes that is the most important thing.

70
00:05:28,640 --> 00:05:32,360
That's about as far as I've come.

71
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:37,720
I have made some small details.
 I didn't have these moldings before.

72
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:40,880
Sat the rear view mirror in place when you were here last?
 -No it didn't.

73
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:44,560
It is stuck in a regular M6 stick bolt.

74
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:48,900
Then it is removable.

75
00:05:48,900 --> 00:05:53,760
You put it first here ...

76
00:05:53,760 --> 00:06:00,140
Now it should be below this so it should be put there first.

77
00:06:00,140 --> 00:06:05,180
Then you attach the mirror so.

78
00:06:05,180 --> 00:06:11,380
What is missing now is the passenger door.
 And fit the rest.

79
00:06:11,380 --> 00:06:17,460
I smooth out the body with armored file.
 -Pansar file?

80
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:24,200
Body file says many experts.
 It is used to get a smooth surface.

81
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:28,700
To get rid of small elevations that exist.

82
00:06:28,700 --> 00:06:32,280
And after that I start grinding with sandpaper.

83
00:06:32,340 --> 00:06:37,480
Should I grind with sandpaper now, it just follows the bumps.

84
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:42,600
The armored file removes the bumps so you can grind then.

85
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:46,420
-How much planes it huh?
 You have to stand for a long time.

86
00:06:46,420 --> 00:06:50,560
You have to be careful so you do not get oblique.

87
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:54,060
Then you cut a jack into the plate.

88
00:06:54,060 --> 00:07:00,700
Then you have to plan the entire area so that the jacket disappears.
 You can't just plan in the same place.

89
00:07:00,700 --> 00:07:03,620
Then there will be a pit there when polishing.

90
00:07:03,620 --> 00:07:10,500
If you have a pit or a jack, you have to plan everything down until you get to the same level.

91
00:07:10,500 --> 00:07:17,540
This surface takes about 5 hours to plan.

92
00:07:17,540 --> 00:07:25,540
Here it is smoother and then it takes 2-3 hours with armored file.

93
00:07:25,540 --> 00:07:29,080
There are various grinders you can use.

94
00:07:29,080 --> 00:07:33,960
I tried a machine that lacquers call pancake.

95
00:07:33,960 --> 00:07:41,060
It is a little bigger and has oscillating grinding.
 It makes this movement.

96
00:07:41,060 --> 00:07:44,700
And it also forced rotates.

97
00:07:44,700 --> 00:07:50,800
An ordinary Oscillery grinding machine does not spin it just vibrates.

98
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:56,280
This machine spins and makes an oscillating motion.

99
00:07:56,280 --> 00:07:59,700
Then it is easy to get the surface smooth.

100
00:07:59,700 --> 00:08:05,420
I have tried that machine on this page and therefore it became much smoother.

101
00:08:05,580 --> 00:08:08,740
That is why I should do the other side.

102
00:08:08,740 --> 00:08:13,320
And then this type of abrasive paper is used.

103
00:08:13,320 --> 00:08:18,580
This abrasive paper is larger than ordinary.
 So it takes a larger area and it is easier to get flat.

104
00:08:18,660 --> 00:08:23,080
-What do you start with for abrasive paper?
 This is 180.

105
00:08:23,080 --> 00:08:26,920
From 180 up to 2000 I use.

106
00:08:26,920 --> 00:08:33,800
With 1000 and 2000, I grind with water at the same time.

107
00:08:33,800 --> 00:08:36,180
Then it becomes this surface.

108
00:08:36,180 --> 00:08:40,160
I use window cleaning.
 I think that is smoother.

109
00:08:40,160 --> 00:08:45,420
It gets a little halter and does not chop as much and easier to wipe.

110
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:48,920
-This is crafts without its like.

111
00:08:48,920 --> 00:08:54,500
Yes it is ... we can take the other instead.
 This one is stuck.

112
00:08:54,980 --> 00:08:59,860
It is instead of chrome or painting.

113
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:07,460
It has a tendency to be burned fairly quickly.
 So it's better to make a cover covering over.

114
00:09:07,460 --> 00:09:14,500
-Mm, such a cover you do in 20 min ... NO half an hour..hahaha!

115
00:09:14,920 --> 00:09:17,340
-Crazy!
 No it takes a little longer.

116
00:09:17,340 --> 00:09:21,880
Here you get some cooling.
 Yes.

117
00:09:21,880 --> 00:09:26,960
It takes in the air here and releases it on the underside.

118
00:09:26,960 --> 00:09:30,380
Then it gets a stream of air that cools down.

119
00:09:30,380 --> 00:09:36,520
-Is this polished and clear?
 No it is rough polished but should be finely polished.

120
00:09:36,520 --> 00:09:40,160
-And the one on the other side is just ground?
 Yes it is just ground.

121
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:44,520
I have started to polish a little neighbor.

122
00:09:44,520 --> 00:09:49,080
-Do you drive a machine then?
 Yes it will be a bench machine.

123
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:51,740
As I drive in 3 different roughness.

124
00:09:51,740 --> 00:09:57,740
-The lights were stuck last.
 Yes but I can't remember if this one was done then.

125
00:09:57,740 --> 00:10:05,220
This one will be unpolished but the stripes will be polished.

126
00:10:05,220 --> 00:10:09,080
Possibly the edge around.

127
00:10:09,080 --> 00:10:12,880
I thought it looked a little naked so I turned sleeves.

128
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:16,660
So it looks like it is a screw and there is a little more life in it.

129
00:10:16,660 --> 00:10:24,020
The screws will be replaced so there will be recessed screws with lids in brass.

130
00:10:24,020 --> 00:10:26,700
Here will be brass washers.

131
00:10:26,700 --> 00:10:30,500
-You have an eye for details.
 That's the fun.

132
00:10:30,500 --> 00:10:34,940
That is the icing on the cake.
 -It's what makes the difference.

133
00:10:34,940 --> 00:10:38,880
I think it can be good ... you can always hope.

134
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:42,140
-Here you have started sketching the rims.
 Yes.

135
00:10:42,980 --> 00:10:48,740
I want a different piece on them than original.

136
00:10:48,780 --> 00:10:52,120
That is an original rim.

137
00:10:52,120 --> 00:11:01,180
Spinnersen I do not want so I have also shortened this cover and made it tighter.

138
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:08,220
I am thinking about using brass in this pattern.

139
00:11:08,220 --> 00:11:14,920
Also in the center cover where I engrave Chevrolet in brass.

140
00:11:14,920 --> 00:11:18,840
And it should be press folds in the brass.

141
00:11:18,840 --> 00:11:22,760
The same pressed brass as it is on the wheel.

142
00:11:22,760 --> 00:11:26,900
So it will be like spokes that I should have on the rims with.

143
00:11:26,900 --> 00:11:31,900
I'll test on a rim so I'll see what it looks like.

144
00:11:31,900 --> 00:11:36,540
I'm a little unsure if it fits but we'll see that.

145
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:40,360
-You don't know first you have tried.
 Just.

146
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:46,300
And then it gets a little personal piece on the rim but we'll see.

147
00:11:46,300 --> 00:11:50,100
-The interesting, it will be fun to see when it's done.

148
00:11:51,540 --> 00:11:55,260
-I guess you want to go on and work?
 Yes.

149
00:11:55,260 --> 00:11:58,620
Yes we are heard and on reunion.
 Bye.
