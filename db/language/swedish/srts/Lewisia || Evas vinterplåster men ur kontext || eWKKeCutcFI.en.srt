00:00:01.734 --> 00:00:02.515

00:00:02.515 --> 00:00:03.434
It island

4
00:00:03.434 --> 00:00:06.868
If there is no one who brows with the horn layer ...

5
00:00:06.868 --> 00:00:08.725
Here comes the winter

6
00:00:08.725 --> 00:00:10.287
Oohh I'm so thirsty

7
00:00:10.287 --> 00:00:12.458
Where is there water, where is there water

8
00:00:12.458 --> 00:00:13.937
And then it starts looking.

9
00:00:13.937 --> 00:00:14.551
Uhrrrr

10
00:00:14.763 --> 00:00:17.458
Well then we would collapse like empty bags.

11
00:00:17.458 --> 00:00:19.355
Now it is

12
00:00:19.355 --> 00:00:20.336
𝐟 𝐞 𝐭 𝐭

13
00:00:20.336 --> 00:00:22.234

Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh

00:00:27.763 --> 00:00:30.468
The whole house is full of childhood diseases.

21
00:00:30.647 --> 00:00:31.925
But one must not itch

22
00:00:31.925 --> 00:00:32.601
No

23
00:00:32.601 --> 00:00:34.337
And then I recommend

24
00:00:34.337 --> 00:00:36.120
that you only eat

25
00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:37.718
Mashed food.
 (mm mums)

26
00:00:37.718 --> 00:00:39.730
Starts all the antibodies to go

27
00:00:39.730 --> 00:00:41.951
in a scarlet fever school.

28
00:00:42.445 --> 00:00:44.794
Cold...

29
00:00:45.131 --> 00:00:46.069
Hello

30
00:00:46.069 --> 00:00:47.601
Cold.

31
00:00:47.868 --> 00:00:51.634
Now check out all these yellow pups.

32
00:00:51.634 --> 00:00:53.835
We say I poke myself in the eye.

33
00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.000
Remember that this is a yellow plump.

34
00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:57.084
But now

35
00:00:57.084 --> 00:00:59.234
Now the body gets angry

36
00:00:59.234 --> 00:01:00.317
Eghu!

Now it's hot

39
00:01:03.424 --> 00:01:05.034
So it's good with fever.

40
00:01:05.034 --> 00:01:05.566
Well.

41
00:01:05.566 --> 00:01:07.295
Then you get pain in the ear too.

42
00:01:07.295 --> 00:01:08.000
Snort

43
00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:08.939

You want to swim on Saturdays,

00:01:45.302 --> 00:01:46.479
You want to go on a party

74
00:01:46.479 --> 00:01:47.148

to take it easy

78
00:01:51.662 --> 00:01:54.464
And just look at clouds.
