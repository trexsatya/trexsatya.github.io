1
00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:08.600
Last dance, last chance

2
00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:13.840
SNORES

3
00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:34.880
-Satan, AJ!
 - They have called from the municipality again.

4
00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:39.440
It is Björn at Getberget, we have to trace it.

5
00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:42.920
Should we ask if Elin wants to come along?

6
00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:47.560
Should she run in the woods in high heels?

7
00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:52.440
She does not survive a crows.
 Come now.

8
00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:57.240
- But Leif ... - no but!

9
00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:27.000
Departure sound

10
00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:32.640
Fuck!

11
00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:54.400
Hörtu, Leif.
 Check.

12
00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:04.960
Fuck!

13
00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:12.040
- Is it Björn?
 - I know int '.

14
00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:15.240
Move.

15
00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:20.320
It is smoking fresh.

16
00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:25.440
Damn!
 It's a bear here!

17
00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:29.760
-Are you sure?
 -Yes.

18
00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:37.400
-What are you doing?
 - I play death.

19
00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:40.560
Up with you, snap skull!

20
00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:46.080
- I run home!
 -Silent!
 You stay.

21
00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:50.240
Hisses

22
00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:52.480
- Hell, no, no, no!
 - Introduce combat position.

23
00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:58.600
Not on me, damn thick!

24
00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:05.960
She is behind the stone.
 Advance!

25
00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:16.320
Are you ready?
 Let's go.
 Go, go, go!

26
00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:19.720
Stop!
 It's just me.

27
00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:26.160
–Elin.
 - I could shot the skull of you!

28
00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:29.680
I was just joking, sorry.

29
00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:34.000
You can not lie here and sound like a bear!

30
00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:37.480
Don't know how a bear sounds?

31
00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:44.280
- ELIN may know what the stool is.
 - Maybe I know.

32
00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:49.440
Hardly.
 You have probably perfume in the armpit and skull there.

33
00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:55.480
The animals you have scared away long roads' journey with screams and perfume.

34
00:03:55.640 --> 00:04:01.640
- What have you come up with, then?
 - Bajs sausage belongs to a bear female.

35
00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:06.840
- Now we have to move.
 - Can I hook up?

36
00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:11.560
It would be nice!

37
00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:17.000
We have no choice.
 If we leave you, you become minced meat.

38
00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:20.960
Come then.
 Hurry up.

39
00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:27.080
Sound like a pig in the woods ... - and you think it's fun, Billy.

40
00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:29.920
Elin joked.

41
00:04:47.480 --> 00:04:52.920
Yes ... now you are int 'among tile stoves, fools and trams.

42
00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:57.760
What is it like to be in the forest with real hunters?

43
00:04:57.920 --> 00:05:02.320
I camped alone here when I was ten.

44
00:05:02.480 --> 00:05:09.120
When I was 14, I shot a moose.
 I am as much hunter as you.

45
00:05:09.280 --> 00:05:13.560
She says she is as much hunter as me ...

46
00:05:13.720 --> 00:05:19.440
- You haven't read the hunting book?
 - You mean this?

47
00:05:19.600 --> 00:05:26.480
I've read it a couple of times.
 We make quiz with facts from here!

48
00:05:26.640 --> 00:05:29.640
Yes, I can read the questions.

49
00:05:29.800 --> 00:05:36.000
We must have a price too.
 This note that you ran from ...

50
00:05:36.160 --> 00:05:39.520
I paid SEK 3,244.

51
00:05:39.680 --> 00:05:45.600
If you win, then it's "fine".
 If I win, you will pay back.

52
00:05:48.880 --> 00:05:53.800
- Yes ... then drive.
 - Fan, what fun!

53
00:05:53.960 --> 00:06:00.120
Okay, first question.
 "Which of the following is a hunting dog:"

54
00:06:00.280 --> 00:06:05.240
"Jack Russell, Gray Dog or Shepherd?"

55
00:06:05.400 --> 00:06:11.280
- You can start.
 - You can train any dog.

56
00:06:11.440 --> 00:06:17.920
It doesn't matter.
 That's my final answer.

57
00:06:18.080 --> 00:06:21.480
It is for the hell a gear.

58
00:06:21.640 --> 00:06:26.720
–Line?
 - The right answer is gray dog.

59
00:06:26.880 --> 00:06:30.280
Right!
 1-0 to Elin.

60
00:06:30.440 --> 00:06:35.560
Second question: "What is the moose in Latin?"

61
00:06:35.720 --> 00:06:40.760
—Leif?
 Do you want to answer?
 —The elig is ...

62
00:06:40.920 --> 00:06:46.040
It's called ÄlgoSaurus ... Sus ... something in that direction.

63
00:06:46.200 --> 00:06:49.760
Moose is called "Alces Alces" in Latin.

64
00:06:49.920 --> 00:06:54.440
-Right!
 2-0 to Elin.
 -Woo hoo!
 Bam!

65
00:06:54.600 --> 00:06:59.680
"Bäm" ... I'm not going to read trams in some fucking fourth book.

66
00:06:59.840 --> 00:07:05.880
I have a pain in the skull, I have been useful all day.

67
00:07:08.320 --> 00:07:13.640
- So ... - then you won, Elin.

68
00:07:13.800 --> 00:07:19.520
Yes, I did.
 Should we play cards?

69
00:07:19.680 --> 00:07:24.640
- We can do that.
 - Billy, come and lie down.

70
00:07:27.480 --> 00:07:32.120
Yes ... another time.
 Good night, Elin.

71
00:07:34.360 --> 00:07:37.680
Goodnight sleep well.

72
00:07:41.640 --> 00:07:45.640
Oh my God.
 Leif Öhman ...

73
00:07:53.480 --> 00:08:00.520
- Billy: Where will this be?
 –Leif: Get the sticks here.
 Not like that!

74
00:08:03.960 --> 00:08:09.680
-What are you doing?
 - Hunters do not sleep half the day.

75
00:08:09.840 --> 00:08:13.480
The clock is half past four!

76
00:08:13.640 --> 00:08:18.640
But, Leif ... You're not angry for the quiz?

77
00:08:18.800 --> 00:08:25.000
You do not learn that little book in your handbag as a real hunter.

78
00:08:25.160 --> 00:08:28.640
In practice, you have no chance.

79
00:08:28.800 --> 00:08:32.720
Come on something else we can compete in, then!

80
00:08:32.880 --> 00:08:38.800
Okay, it's just for wilderness men, but we take you to the hunting track.

81
00:08:38.960 --> 00:08:44.600
- Hunting?
 - So she has to look at one and the other.

82
00:08:44.760 --> 00:08:51.040
Oh, oh, now you have taken water over the skull.
 Come.

83
00:08:54.120 --> 00:08:57.240
Let's see...

84
00:09:02.120 --> 00:09:07.960
-What is this?
 - It is my and Leif's hunting track.

85
00:09:08.120 --> 00:09:14.320
My record is 1.03 and Leifs in 54 seconds blank.

86
00:09:15.360 --> 00:09:20.920
You have never seen a real hunting track?
 Watch and learn.

87
00:09:43.280 --> 00:09:48.120
-Are you ready?
 - Drive, Billy!

88
00:09:49.520 --> 00:09:52.680
3, 2, 1, drive!

89
00:10:45.960 --> 00:10:49.000
Warning for scabies!

90
00:10:58.760 --> 00:11:02.160
Oh, Satan's SKabbräd attack!

91
00:11:02.920 --> 00:11:05.720
Pepper spray.

92
00:11:18.080 --> 00:11:23.240
You beat your old record by two seconds.
 Congratulations!

93
00:11:23.400 --> 00:11:29.240
-What are you saying now, Lill-Stockholm?
 –Ever, see-ri-east?

94
00:11:29.400 --> 00:11:32.320
What are you doing?

95
00:11:32.480 --> 00:11:38.880
No normal person fights against stuffed animals!
 It's just sick!

96
00:11:39.040 --> 00:11:44.280
- Yes, Leif does it ... - Yes, I see Leif does it!

97
00:11:44.440 --> 00:11:48.600
So ... should we see who is the best?

98
00:11:48.760 --> 00:11:52.760
Why not a regular, fucking shooting test?

99
00:11:52.920 --> 00:11:57.920
Now the evasions come hail.
 So this is not enough?

100
00:11:58.080 --> 00:12:04.400
- A simple shooting test ... sure.
 -Thanks so much.

101
00:12:04.560 --> 00:12:07.200
Good.

102
00:12:07.200 --> 00:12:13.520
Stick away and pick up two jars, then.
 I am tired of the Stockholm Folleriet.

103
00:12:21.600 --> 00:12:27.960
- You start, little Stockholm.
 - Yes, I can start.

104
00:12:39.160 --> 00:12:41.720
Satan ...

105
00:12:43.600 --> 00:12:46.000
Complete!

106
00:12:46.160 --> 00:12:49.440
Now it's your turn.

107
00:12:49.600 --> 00:12:54.360
Move the jar to the little one in front of the big stone.

108
00:13:03.160 --> 00:13:07.040
Leif ... should you really aim for it?

109
00:13:07.200 --> 00:13:12.400
You can't shoot at a stone, it can be ricochet.

110
00:13:12.560 --> 00:13:15.560
You can't aim for the stone!

111
00:13:19.120 --> 00:13:24.840
Well, Leif!
 Are you sick in your head?
 It is fatal!

112
00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:28.200
Do not you understand?!
 That's enough!

113
00:13:28.360 --> 00:13:34.760
Here is the bill!
 I won this "competition".
 BYE!

114
00:13:36.840 --> 00:13:41.800
By the way.
 That poop ... I can help with it.

115
00:13:41.960 --> 00:13:45.480
There was no bear.
 It was mine.

116
00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:52.920
Cursed ...

117
00:13:54.840 --> 00:13:57.200
Burner!

118
00:14:01.520 --> 00:14:05.760
- Billy!
 -Leif!

119
00:14:05.920 --> 00:14:10.000
- What the hell has happened?
 - I've been hit in the shit.

120
00:14:10.160 --> 00:14:15.120
- It's no danger, up!
 - No, I want to die alone.

121
00:14:15.280 --> 00:14:19.680
- Creed yourself.
 - We will take you to the hospital.

122
00:14:19.840 --> 00:14:25.440
-I will die.
 Hurry!
 -Get up!
 Come then.

123
00:14:26.960 --> 00:14:32.400
- You have to take care of the farm.
 - You will not die.

124
00:14:32.560 --> 00:14:35.880
Wear me, I'm paralyzed.

125
00:14:36.040 --> 00:14:40.840
Chill down and take it easy

126
00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:46.080
Tag down a little while

127
00:14:46.240 --> 00:14:52.120
Inhale and then out a second ...

128
00:14:52.280 --> 00:14:56.880
