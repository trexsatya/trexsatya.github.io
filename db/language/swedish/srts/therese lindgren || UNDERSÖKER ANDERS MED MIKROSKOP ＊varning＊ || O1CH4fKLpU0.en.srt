1
00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:01.600
But fuck what this is disgusting

2
00:00:01.640 --> 00:00:03.480
Yeah, who is watching this video even

3
00:00:03.520 --> 00:00:07.040
Yes, it can only be sick people.
 Fy fuck

4
00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:09.320
Everyone just: "How are you really" - yes.

5
00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:14.680
You have been exposed

6
00:00:22.280 --> 00:00:26.160
What do you mean - but I have told you how

7
00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:32.400
Sticky you are.
 That I get red rashes all over my face after you hug me.

8
00:00:32.440 --> 00:00:38.520
Do you see that I am red here it is because I just just hugged Anders.

9
00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:45.160
He came in here and gave me a hug.
 It is absolutely sick how sensitive skin I have.

10
00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:49.080
Or how dirty boyfriend I have.

11
00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:54.960
This is an intervention.
 Yes?

12
00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:01.640
The first time Anders and I met, he told me:

13
00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:10.440
"Dirty Boy ..." Yes.
 So now you have to be responsible!

14
00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:12.640
I am prepared to do that actually.
 Okay.

15
00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:16.880
You who have been hanging out here at the Youtube channel for a long time surely remember to

16
00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:21.320
I have this microscope, or what is it for

17
00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:24.120
Well it's a microscope.
 I thought like this tool, but microscope is correct.

18
00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:29.200
It is a microscope that I have partly made a youtube video where I examined

19
00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:30.600
Different parts of my own body ...

20
00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:37.040
What was that

21
00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:40.720
... and I made a video where I have examined mold.

22
00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:47.880
But Fy it looks almost like some kind of cobwebs!

23
00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:52.400
And I have made a video where I examined the dogs with a microscope.

24
00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:54.760
Who is tagged on a new video

25
00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:03.440
So ... last out in this series ...

26
00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:05.760
... am I - that's you.

27
00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:08.040
But then we'll see if I'm dirty then.
 Yes.

28
00:02:09.120 --> 00:02:12.240
But I have showered.
 Okay.

29
00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:13.400
Let's go

30
00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:18.800
Yes, then we drive what do you feel?
 I feel like this that I want to start with the beard,

31
00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:24.440
Because I want to know why I get red outlaws in the face when you be beeping with me.

32
00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:25.320
Beard me

33
00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:31.320
I think I'll move the camera a bit like that so I can post the picture here.

34
00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:33.760
But God, the sun goes out and in all the time, Anders.

35
00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:35.280
Don't you play this now too

36
00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:38.360
No, I don't fuck that.
 Good, Anders but what is it, I am pondering

37
00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:42.400
If we should put any trigger warning about it.

38
00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:47.240
Help Anders, what thick hairs - but if you look up in my hair then?

39
00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:50.480
I have nothing to compare with, when you say they are thick.

40
00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:54.640
Okay, but here you have a beard.

41
00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:59.720
And then up on the head, kind of what thin - oh!

42
00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:01.560
They are really funny

43
00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:06.120
No, how disgusting that is.
 Oh, no, get away!

44
00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:08.200
What is help!

45
00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:15.480
That's just my baby died, yeah that's just my baby died!

46
00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:18.560
Check out, you have this blonde hairs in the beard you see?

47
00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:22.480
Oh - oh, you really have no pigment!

48
00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:27.160
Check out how they sit.
 There is the hair follicle.
 Wow, what cool, Anders

49
00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:28.200
What sick it was

50
00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:32.720
Do you see it is like a white ... - It's a white straw and a membrane over.

51
00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:39.400
Yes.
 God there!
 But Anders, how can I reach then?

52
00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:41.720
Aj - the Anders, what is it?

53
00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:46.280
Oh what the hell is that?
 Damn what disgusting this is!

54
00:03:46.320 --> 00:03:47.360
What is that for something then

55
00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:49.920
After all, I have a blood thing here on my nose somewhere.

56
00:03:49.960 --> 00:03:52.760
A blood thing - yeah so, I've happened

57
00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:56.880
scratch me and ... can't you check out there

58
00:03:56.920 --> 00:04:01.840
Be then - here somewhere.
 Uuh!
 Oh!
 Take it away!

59
00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:06.080
Remove it, Therese for hell!
 Fy damn how disgusting it was!
 Can you zoom out!

60
00:04:06.240 --> 00:04:08.520
What kind of thing is that I do not know.
 I close my eyes because it is so disgusting.

61
00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:11.360
The nose then - oh, no!

62
00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:17.720
No, no, no there are pores!
 Yuk!
 - Oh my good, Anders!

63
00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:20.360
But Fy Faan

64
00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:25.920
I feel bad about that.
 You don't push so nicely against your nose either.

65
00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:27.200
It just gets harder and harder.
 Look there!

66
00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:31.280
I can not see.
 You have your hands everywhere.
 Yes.
 There you have a wound.

67
00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:34.000
Oh - what is that?

68
00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:38.560
Nämen oj - coagulated blood.
 But where is it from?

69
00:04:39.160 --> 00:04:41.800
From the head.
 So damn what disgusting everything is!

70
00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:42.680
What is this - where are you?

71
00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:45.000
Yes, what is this body part - but where are you, Therese?

72
00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:50.240
Is it in your ear, or where are you - here!

73
00:04:50.720 --> 00:04:53.360
Well how the hell should I be able to see where you are - the YOM don't you know?

74
00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:56.200
Is it in the ear where it ends

75
00:04:56.240 --> 00:04:58.880
Yes exactly.
 So that to the left you see the snib.

76
00:04:59.400 --> 00:05:01.880
But then this is so disgusting!

77
00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:05.480
I shudder are you seeing my hair?
 I think it's so disgusting!

78
00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:06.960
Do you see I sparkle!

79
00:05:07.400 --> 00:05:10.960
Why are you sparkling is that makeup?
 - mm.
 Indy Beauty's highlighter.

80
00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:16.000
Recommended for Women - Why can't you turn off now?

81
00:05:16.040 --> 00:05:17.640
What has happened - oh!
 Oh!
 What's that?

82
00:05:17.680 --> 00:05:19.760
Nämen Anders - what the hell is that?

83
00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:23.080
Can they stop calling at some point blunt!

84
00:05:23.120 --> 00:05:26.280
Anders - can solve that in some way.

85
00:05:28.840 --> 00:05:30.240
What is this what is this?

86
00:05:30.280 --> 00:05:33.400
It's your thumb.
 Lol!
 Oh!

87
00:05:33.440 --> 00:05:36.800
How should I be able to look under your nails when you bite

88
00:05:36.840 --> 00:05:43.400
On the nails, Anders I can't look under a single nail.
 Baby!

89
00:05:43.440 --> 00:05:48.840
Hahaha do you want a toe then?
 - Oh my God!

90
00:05:48.880 --> 00:05:50.040
I don't bite them.

91
00:05:55.400 --> 00:05:56.800
What is it - what has happened?

92
00:05:56.840 --> 00:06:00.720
What then - now we should check under the nail on the toe.

93
00:06:00.760 --> 00:06:03.920
Yes.
 That's what you wanted - I don't know.

94
00:06:03.960 --> 00:06:07.400
Oh - Why do you have glitter on your toes?

95
00:06:09.400 --> 00:06:11.040
Hahaha - It wasn't that bad?

96
00:06:12.520 --> 00:06:16.880
Oh, this looks like some kind of reptile.
 Yeah don't

97
00:06:16.920 --> 00:06:19.080
Yes, maybe.
 This could be a snake.

98
00:06:19.120 --> 00:06:22.240
What is that - a blood bladder?

99
00:06:22.280 --> 00:06:24.160
Porer I do not think is disgusting at all.
 Should I scratch it up?

100
00:06:24.200 --> 00:06:26.600
No no!
 Are you stupid?
 - Hahaha!
 I was just joking.

101
00:06:26.760 --> 00:06:30.400
Haha but damn what this is disgusting!
 - Yes, who is watching this one

102
00:06:30.440 --> 00:06:33.440
The video even - yes, it can only be sick people.

103
00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:36.640
Fy fuck - hello?
 How are you doing?

104
00:06:36.800 --> 00:06:40.720
Yes.
 I don't think there are psychologists for this.

105
00:06:41.320 --> 00:06:46.160
No.
 It's beyond all help.
 Only Jesus can help.

106
00:06:47.120 --> 00:06:51.480
Jesus - Anders has a navel.

107
00:06:51.880 --> 00:06:56.680
Yes - which collects incredible amounts of cotton.

108
00:06:56.960 --> 00:07:00.200
Well it is not something unnatural.
 No, that's what he says.

109
00:07:00.240 --> 00:07:05.400
I've never had ... I just want to say for the record that I've never had ...

110
00:07:05.440 --> 00:07:10.880
I have never looked down, pulled up my sweater and seen a little lint in the navel.

111
00:07:10.920 --> 00:07:12.920
But the thing is that I have hair on my stomach.

112
00:07:12.960 --> 00:07:16.200
That's what does it.
 Everyone who has hair on the stomach,

113
00:07:16.240 --> 00:07:20.880
Regardless of the gender, which has a tshirt or shirt will have lint here.

114
00:07:20.920 --> 00:07:21.560
I promise

115
00:07:21.600 --> 00:07:24.760
Well then I would like to know down here in the comments section.

116
00:07:24.800 --> 00:07:29.760
If it is true that all of you who have hair on your stomach, you also have large amounts of lint

117
00:07:36.200 --> 00:07:38.840
It curls out under the sweater

118
00:07:38.880 --> 00:07:43.640
What are you doing now - I'm looking.
 Check this out!
 Check this out!

119
00:07:43.760 --> 00:07:45.840
Well it starts there.
 It is starting to gather now.

120
00:07:46.800 --> 00:07:48.920
And so my hair works.
 But there is grass there!

121
00:07:50.200 --> 00:07:51.600
Yes, I don't know where it comes from.

122
00:07:53.560 --> 00:07:55.680
It feels like you are doing such ultrasound as

123
00:07:55.720 --> 00:07:59.040
You do when you are pregnant.
 Takes such a batter first and then ...

124
00:07:59.080 --> 00:08:01.680
Hahaha batter first ...

125
00:08:01.720 --> 00:08:05.000
Imagine if we were to see a little one there ... but what a hard time if there was a child there.

126
00:08:05.040 --> 00:08:07.720
Oh - oh, purple!
 What's that?

127
00:08:07.760 --> 00:08:09.800
Decor - Decor?

128
00:08:10.600 --> 00:08:11.960
May I look at the tattoo

129
00:08:13.560 --> 00:08:18.520
Oh theres!
 You must not scrape in the wart.
 I hate it.

130
00:08:18.680 --> 00:08:21.120
Check out what disgusting this is.
 It looks so disgusting

131
00:08:21.160 --> 00:08:23.240
No.
 Want to see my scalp

132
00:08:23.280 --> 00:08:28.760
It is very white.
 Now look at my color there.
 Oh what a difference!

133
00:08:30.440 --> 00:08:32.600
You are more pink huh - yes.

134
00:08:33.160 --> 00:08:34.480
Nämen Hello - Hahaha!

135
00:08:34.800 --> 00:08:37.720
Hello - Oh what yellow teeth!

136
00:08:38.520 --> 00:08:42.520
Close mouth then check here!
 - mm.

137
00:08:43.680 --> 00:08:44.880
Yes there yes.
 What is it?

138
00:08:45.720 --> 00:08:47.200
I do not know.

139
00:08:50.400 --> 00:08:57.040
That was disgusting yes.
 In the armpit as well.

140
00:08:57.080 --> 00:09:03.520
If we are to finish there The Extended version you can find on the snake pit.

141
00:09:03.560 --> 00:09:04.280
Hahaha

142
00:09:04.800 --> 00:09:07.000
Sorry about..?

143
00:09:07.040 --> 00:09:10.600
This video.
 Why?
 Yes, yes, actually.
 Sorry.

144
00:09:10.640 --> 00:09:11.520
Fy fuck what disgusting it was

145
00:09:11.560 --> 00:09:16.040
Thank you for checking today.
 See you again next week.
 Take care of yourselves

146
00:09:16.080 --> 00:09:18.880
Kiss and hug -Ciao!
