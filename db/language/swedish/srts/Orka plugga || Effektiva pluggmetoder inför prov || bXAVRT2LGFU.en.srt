00:00:01,520 --> 00:00:04,280
Is it time for national tests and other tests?

2
00:00:04,440 --> 00:00:08,280
Maybe you have a lot of plug right now and wonder how to catch up.

3
00:00:08,440 --> 00:00:12,480
Here are tips on three methods that streamline your plugging.

4
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:19,280
An effective method to see what you can and cannot.

5
00:00:19,440 --> 00:00:22,960
It is about starting to read a chapter or some pages.

6
00:00:23,120 --> 00:00:25,880
Then put away the text and bring out a paper-

7
00:00:26,040 --> 00:00:28,200
-And scribble down everything you remember.

8
00:00:28,360 --> 00:00:30,680
It can be like a mindmap or short sentences.

9
00:00:30,840 --> 00:00:33,040
So it doesn't have to be a finished text.

10
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:35,600
Take the book again and compare:

11
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:37,880
What did you get with and what have you missed?

12
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:41,680
This will give you a quick answer to what you need to plug more on.

13
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:44,680
The method is also good because you activate your brain-

14
00:00:44,840 --> 00:00:48,080
-and have to produce what you remember.
 It makes it you learned-

15
00:00:48,240 --> 00:00:51,720
-Fastes better and you will have easier to remember on the sample.

16
00:00:53,320 --> 00:00:57,120
Explain in simple words: to try to explain something in a simple way-

17
00:00:57,280 --> 00:00:59,240
-is effective to learn something new-

18
00:00:59,400 --> 00:01:01,960
-or increase understanding of something you already know.

19
00:01:02,120 --> 00:01:04,400
Write down an explanation with simple words-

20
00:01:04,560 --> 00:01:07,760
-As you should tell someone who can't do anything about it before.

21
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:10,560
You can even
 Imagine it is a child that you have to explain to.

22
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:14,400
Go through what you missed and see if you can simplify it further.

23
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:18,000
The more knowledge you have, the easier it is to explain in simple words.

24
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:22,040
You can also orally tell someone about what you just learned.

25
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:24,960
If you can explain something in a simple way with your own words-

26
00:01:25,120 --> 00:01:28,600
-Ths that you have understood and know what you tell you about.

27
00:01:28,760 --> 00:01:32,000
And since you actively recount and repeat what you learned-

28
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:34,320
-Will you remember it anymore.

29
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:41,120
Answering questions about what you just read can make you remember better-

30
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:42,800
-And learn faster.

31
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:45,640
Instead of reading a text several times-

32
00:01:45,800 --> 00:01:49,080
-and just try to wear in what you read you can try to interrogate yourself-

33
00:01:49,240 --> 00:01:52,760
-periodically.
 Start by reading a number of pages-

34
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:55,320
-And then write down questions on what you read.

35
00:01:55,480 --> 00:01:58,960
Put away the text and try to answer your questions without watching.

36
00:01:59,120 --> 00:02:01,120
Then check up your answers and correct.

37
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:04,160
Then it becomes clear what you remember and what you need to go back to-

38
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:07,640
-and plug more on.
 The next time you plug you can start by check-

39
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:09,960
-If you remember the answers to your questions.

40
00:02:10,120 --> 00:02:13,280
The advantage of plugging in this way is to strengthen the memory-

41
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:16,040
-and causes the knowledge to get stuck in a more effective manner-

42
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:19,800
-Stheft you force the brain to immediately pick up what you have learned.

43
00:02:21,640 --> 00:02:24,200
Thus: quickly write down all you remember-

44
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:26,400
-Af to have read a piece.

45
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:29,640
Explain in a simple way what you learned for someone else.

46
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:33,480
Ask questions and interrogate yourself on what you read.

47
00:02:33,640 --> 00:02:35,160
Good luck!
