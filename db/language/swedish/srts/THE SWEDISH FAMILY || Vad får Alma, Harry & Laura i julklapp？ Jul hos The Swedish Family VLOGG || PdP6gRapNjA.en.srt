1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:01,600
God, what a fail!

2
00:00:01,720 --> 00:00:03,450
It's just sunny outside.

3
00:00:03,560 --> 00:00:06,160
Give it to me!
 Give me them!

4
00:00:06,400 --> 00:00:08,673
Yes, the mood went ...

5
00:00:10,120 --> 00:00:14,115
Alma is a little scared on trains.
 You have to respect it.

6
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:31,160
It says Uaua.
 (Laura)

7
00:00:32,201 --> 00:00:34,000
It says Uaua.
 (Laura)

8
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:36,160
- Is it Laura?
 - Yes.

9
00:00:36,277 --> 00:00:39,800
- Let's see.
 - Show it to mom.

10
00:00:41,400 --> 00:00:45,240
- No, it says Alma.
 - It's UAUA!

11
00:00:45,329 --> 00:00:46,400
Yes, okay.

12
00:00:46,490 --> 00:00:50,920
She very much wants this pink stamp to be her stamp.

13
00:00:51,009 --> 00:00:52,880
UAUA!

14
00:00:53,960 --> 00:00:59,880
We are trying to record this video with a new camera.

15
00:00:59,880 --> 00:01:00,494
Yes.

16
00:01:00,494 --> 00:01:04,400
- A new camera.
 - A new camera.
 Yes.

17
00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:10,400
So if picture or sound is a little different, then you know why.

18
00:01:14,800 --> 00:01:18,650
This is what it looks like, the new camera.

19
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,280
It's so small.

20
00:01:22,160 --> 00:01:25,800
And soon Christmas is corner, so I have this.

21
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:33,880
- Hello.
 - Hello!
 What are you doing?

22
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:37,120
I play with my toys.

23
00:01:37,320 --> 00:01:40,640
- We are testing the new camera.
 - mm.

24
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,600
- Surely it is small?
 - mm.

25
00:01:43,800 --> 00:01:45,829
How is it?

26
00:01:46,221 --> 00:01:47,401
Good.

27
00:01:47,560 --> 00:01:51,560
You seem a little sad almost.

28
00:01:53,760 --> 00:01:55,080
Nah.

29
00:01:55,160 --> 00:01:57,815
- Sure?
 - mm.

30
00:01:58,800 --> 00:02:02,720
Could it be that you are a little angry because you couldn't sit with the screen anymore?

31
00:02:02,839 --> 00:02:04,226
A little.

32
00:02:04,650 --> 00:02:10,240
Harry sat and played Roblox and then ended the screen time.

33
00:02:10,320 --> 00:02:13,400
And yes, the mood went ...

34
00:02:14,010 --> 00:02:19,320
We are pretty used to it and I think many families are.

35
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:25,080
- What?
 Speeding of screen disease?
 - Yes.
 That children get sad when you say that it is enough with screen.

36
00:02:25,193 --> 00:02:30,480
Yes.
 Completely oblique dopamine levels.
 I think that is very common.

37
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:35,035
- I think we should try to get out of the house.
 - Yes.

38
00:02:35,381 --> 00:02:41,276
- Mom, give me the pacifier today!
 - No.

39
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:46,400
- What do you scream about, Laura?
 - Uaua have the pacifier today!

40
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:50,800
No, there will be no pacifier today.
 We take the pacifier fight.

41
00:02:50,880 --> 00:02:55,800
No, not, mom!
 Uaua have the pacifier!

42
00:02:55,917 --> 00:03:01,818
- No, no pacifier.
 Only when to sleep.
 - No!
 I don't want to sleep with it!

43
00:03:01,880 --> 00:03:05,800
- No.
 - Ugh!
 (Proprut sounds)

44
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:12,800
Wrong way.
 (Pip) Yes!
 Okay, good.

45
00:03:12,880 --> 00:03:14,656
It is green!

46
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:26,800
- (Alma) Come, come, come!
 - (Harry) Otherwise the doors will be closed.

47
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:30,240
- No, my turn there!
 - (Alma) Shhh.

48
00:03:30,320 --> 00:03:35,560
But Alma is a little scared on trains.
 You have to respect it.
 She wanted you to come on quickly.

49
00:03:35,640 --> 00:03:38,240
I was so scared.
 Can't you help me?

50
00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:42,880
Can't you hold my hand and hug me and say that everything will be fine?

51
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:47,900
- Uaua have the carriage, then?
 - No, you must not pick up your trolley now.
 You can do it when we get off.

52
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:52,174
- We will count on one first.
 - A station.

53
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:27,400
Does your train fear feel something better?

54
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:34,480
So, not really.
 After all, it is still difficult to go by train.

55
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:39,270
Yes, I noticed that.
 But I thought if it has gotten better after this semester?

56
00:04:39,330 --> 00:04:45,640
A little better, because I and Harry have traveled to school sometimes ...

57
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:51,140
Check out, now you get the shade of the camera straight across the face.
 "Sorry" for that.

58
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:59,160
But I know.
 And I thought about it, that we filmed a morning routine when you went by train to school-

59
00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:04,720
-In like September, October, and then you talked ...

60
00:05:04,802 --> 00:05:09,480
- Mom!
 - Hello!
 ... about your traffic phobia.

61
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:16,370
- Yes.
 - And then we got a lot of super nice comments.

62
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:19,240
It was so nice really.
 In other words...

63
00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:26,160
It means so much that when I say something that is hard for me, that you dare say that too.

64
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:28,640
Because I know like it's hard to talk about.

65
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:37,000
- Can we buy ice cream and sweets?
 - Not right now because now Alma is talking about something that is important.

66
00:05:37,080 --> 00:05:38,560
Buy ice cream and sweets ...

67
00:05:38,640 --> 00:05:45,320
So for me it really means a lot that you chose to write so many nice comments, and just ...

68
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:49,600
"I'm also afraid of it, and I feel this way, and I'm afraid of it."

69
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:58,190
I remember it so well, because you sat and read on my mobile and became almost teary eyed, comment after comment.

70
00:05:58,250 --> 00:06:03,800
And so there were so many so we couldn't answer everyone, but we read everyone.

71
00:06:03,880 --> 00:06:07,000
And then you can take the opportunity to thank now, even though it has gone ...

72
00:06:07,080 --> 00:06:08,560
A few months.

73
00:06:08,640 --> 00:06:14,820
- Yes.
 Thank you for sharing.
 - Really nice.
 It means a lot.

74
00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:19,560
- We probably haven't told us where we are going.
 - No.

75
00:06:19,640 --> 00:06:26,880
I have put on my most uncomfortable clothes, because we will actually go and buy a Christmas tree.

76
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:31,880
- Me too!
 - You too.
 Yes.
 Although we will only buy a Christmas tree.

77
00:06:32,010 --> 00:06:35,400
I want a plot.

78
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:41,000
- A Christmas tree and a plot.
 It is enough.
 - It is enough!

79
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:50,400
- Is this the Christmas tree we should buy?
 - No, I think it's just too big.

80
00:06:50,480 --> 00:06:53,000
This one cannot take on the train.

81
00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:56,320
This is probably one of those silver spruce too ...

82
00:06:56,408 --> 00:07:02,400
... which certainly holds very well, but I think it will cost half a fortune.

83
00:07:02,510 --> 00:07:08,000
When we were here the other day she had a lot of fir trees, which is why we went back here.

84
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:13,320
And now it just seems that the most expensive and finest Christmas tree remains.
 But we must probably ask.

85
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:18,190
- Although she has a small deal there, she may have more.
 - Yes exactly.

86
00:07:18,250 --> 00:07:22,000
- Should we go and check out?
 - We go and look.

87
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:34,126
(Portuguese) - Hi, do you have other Christmas trees?
 - I have it, and one that is closed.

88
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:47,880
- There.
 - Well.
 Okay.

89
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:51,920
This is the only other Christmas tree they have.

90
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:57,880
It's a bit depressed, it stands here in the backyard.
 But it looks very big.

91
00:07:57,961 --> 00:08:02,400
- Yes.
 Although it is easier to transport.
 - It is very much easier to transport.

92
00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:07,880
- What do you think, Harry?
 - I think it looks pretty good.
 I like those who are high.

93
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:11,720
But you buy the Christmas tree in the bag as well.
 You do not know what you get.

94
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:16,480
No, but I had expected a much smaller than the two she has left, I can say.

95
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:21,880
These have been left behind because they are so big.
 No one can accommodate them.

96
00:08:21,971 --> 00:08:25,160
- (Portuguese) please.
 - (English please.

97
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:33,400
- What should we do?
 Should we buy a giant fun?
 - So, yes.

98
00:08:33,495 --> 00:08:35,800
But how should we get it home?!

99
00:08:35,960 --> 00:08:44,800
But she says she can fix that kind of someone can drive it home to us, though ...

100
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:49,670
It is unclear.
 We do not know.

101
00:08:52,170 --> 00:08:56,320
But hearing.
 Those two were in the Christmas tree just recently.
 Why are you carrying around on them?

102
00:08:56,400 --> 00:08:59,000
Give it to me!
 Give me them!

103
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:01,740
- "Give me them"?
 - God, what spoiled.

104
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:07,880
Piff and puff are allowed to stay here.
 They must not come along.
 Portuguese piff and puff.

105
00:09:07,960 --> 00:09:11,160
- They come along.
 - No, they must not come home.

106
00:09:11,249 --> 00:09:13,320
They come along!

107
00:09:13,640 --> 00:09:16,160
They come along!

108
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:17,880
Oh...

109
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:25,800
You are a good negotiator, Laura.
 But I do not know.
 We get to consult with the rest of the family.

110
00:10:02,237 --> 00:10:07,720
We got the Christmas tree home, but not the same day we were there but the day after that.

111
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:13,000
And then it went another day because it had to stand here and just get used to the indoor climate.

112
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:14,015
Yes.

113
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:19,480
And I needed to move some houseplants and so on.
 But now this one is and it is huge.

114
00:10:19,560 --> 00:10:21,160
- It's huge.
 - Yes.

115
00:10:21,240 --> 00:10:25,320
And Alma and Harry have gone their last school day.

116
00:10:25,400 --> 00:10:26,560
Yes.

117
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:29,240
- How does it feel?
 - Good.

118
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:31,480
- Do it?
 - Yes.

119
00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:33,240
Awesome, that is.

120
00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:36,640
Now I see that you are looking at yourself on the screen.

121
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:40,800
Axel, help me so he doesn't see it.
 That with a new camera ...

122
00:10:40,890 --> 00:10:44,139
Then I have to spin around it.

123
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:48,987
- Gosh!
 And then I have to do this, then.
 - Yes.

124
00:10:49,400 --> 00:10:52,400
But tomorrow you have school closure.

125
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:57,886
- I have to see the picture of myself.
 - Nämen, stop!

126
00:10:58,400 --> 00:11:00,400
How does it feel to you, Alma?

127
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:06,480
So, it is a bit boring and a little fun, because it is like the end of something, but also the beginning of something else.

128
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:11,000
- Yes.
 You finish in this school.
 - We get to see how it gets.

129
00:11:11,080 --> 00:11:14,640
- Yes.
 - Yes, we really get to see.

130
00:11:14,758 --> 00:11:16,400
Where is Laura now?

131
00:11:16,490 --> 00:11:23,880
Laura is on her crèche, ie kindergarten, so ... and she has barely eaten in the middle.

132
00:11:24,011 --> 00:11:25,160
I know.

133
00:11:25,240 --> 00:11:29,400
So we have some home time without her.
 Yeah!

134
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:32,560
- Are you happy with it?
 - Yes, quite.

135
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:36,880
- She takes up quite a lot.
 - mm.
 Quite.

136
00:11:36,960 --> 00:11:41,850
- Okay, she takes a lot of space.
 - Very much space.

137
00:11:43,400 --> 00:11:46,160
We paid 80 \ Heuro for this Christmas tree.

138
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:55,880
There is a lot of money here in Portugal, but they do not have fir trees here in the same way we have up the north.

139
00:11:56,000 --> 00:12:02,090
- But what does a spruce cost in Sweden?
 - Yes, what does a spruce cost in Sweden?
 I have no idea anymore.

140
00:12:02,170 --> 00:12:06,190
- Comment below, or what?
 - Yes, you must say.
 Comment on what a spruce ...

141
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:16,327
- Are we robbed with our type of 900 kroner spruce?
 - With home delivery.
 Yes maybe.
 But it is worth it for a little Christmas atmosphere.

142
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:23,240
Yes, but what about the Christmas atmosphere?
 Alma, you who stand here barefood and go in shorts and so on.

143
00:12:23,400 --> 00:12:30,640
So ... like that.
 But I don't really think the Christmas atmosphere is snow.

144
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:33,320
Huh?
 It is clear that Christmas atmosphere is snow.

145
00:12:33,400 --> 00:12:40,800
So, it is a big deal, and cold too, though like, the Christmas mood is so much more too.

146
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:45,560
- Do you have a Christmas mood, Harry?
 - No not at all.

147
00:12:45,640 --> 00:12:48,000
And what is it, then?

148
00:12:48,080 --> 00:12:52,480
So ... mostly because we kind of are in a very hot country.

149
00:12:52,573 --> 00:12:59,010
It doesn't even snow.
 It's just sunny outside.
 It's sunset.

150
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:04,480
- Hello.
 - Hello Hello!

151
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:10,240
(Alma) TA-DA!
 It's the Christmas tree, Laura.

152
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:13,720
- Gosh!
 - Did you get shy now?

153
00:13:13,800 --> 00:13:22,000
Hello ... friend!
 Did you get a little shy ... for the Christmas tree?
 Or what happened there?

154
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:27,400
Thus, God what a "fail."
 (failure) We thought she would be surprised.

155
00:13:27,480 --> 00:13:28,800
And happy.

156
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:30,400
- No.
 - No.

157
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:35,400
- Didn't you be happy when you saw the Christmas tree?
 - Are you going to put your little spiff and puff?

158
00:13:35,480 --> 00:13:38,430
It became one.
 Piff.

159
00:13:38,490 --> 00:13:42,080
- Up in the Christmas tree.
 - Should we put it up there?

160
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:43,400
Yes.

161
00:13:43,560 --> 00:13:48,800
You managed to negotiate a spice that lives in the Christmas tree.

162
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:53,576
- Yes, it was a little fun anyway.
 - Give me it, then.

163
00:13:53,606 --> 00:13:59,080
- "Give me it, then."
 - Well, now you should start going and picking.

164
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:05,000
Should you sit in my lap?
 You're so funny.

165
00:14:05,080 --> 00:14:14,800
You can check it.
 There are many nice lights in the Christmas tree.
 And lots of balls and packages and socks.

166
00:14:33,081 --> 00:14:38,400
- What do you have there?
 - corn.

167
00:14:47,480 --> 00:14:50,640
It's a new day again.

168
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:54,800
- And Alma and Harry are at school closure.
 - Yes.

169
00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:58,750
- We were not allowed to participate in it.
 - No.
 Boring, but it can be sometimes.

170
00:14:58,810 --> 00:15:01,560
And Laura, she is in kindergarten.

171
00:15:01,650 --> 00:15:05,800
Every year we get the same today's question from several.

172
00:15:05,880 --> 00:15:11,000
We have already received it on Instagram, and that is what the kids should get in Christmas.

173
00:15:11,080 --> 00:15:14,720
Yes.
 We understand that it is exciting.

174
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:22,240
And since this video comes up the day before Christmas Eve, we can show, because then Alma and Harry will not be able to look.

175
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:23,800
No, exactly.

176
00:15:23,880 --> 00:15:31,560
Laura does not really have the knowledge yet.
 But we can start with her Christmas present from us.

177
00:15:31,720 --> 00:15:35,800
A new "o bebê", and "o bebê" is thus the baby.

178
00:15:35,880 --> 00:15:39,480
Right.
 And what happens when you pull out the pacifier, then?

179
00:15:39,560 --> 00:15:42,720
(Baby crying)

180
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:45,880
No, this is going to be very busy.

181
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,574
(The baby is coping)

182
00:15:48,640 --> 00:15:52,320
- And it can talk a little.
 - "Mom. Mom."

183
00:15:52,432 --> 00:15:57,273
- It said "Mom."
 That's me.
 No, it's Laura!
 - Yes.

184
00:15:57,400 --> 00:16:01,200
- And ... do you want to show Harry's gift, right?
 - Yes I can do that.

185
00:16:01,400 --> 00:16:08,800
Harry is for a while in his life where he will start to keep track of just that - time.

186
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:12,640
So that's why I've bought a watch for him.

187
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:18,240
This is a watch from Swatch ... the watch mark.

188
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:24,560
But it is a special edition that has been published together with Omega,-

189
00:16:24,640 --> 00:16:28,800
-So it resembles an old classic omega.

190
00:16:29,080 --> 00:16:34,480
And there is a timer and a regular watch on it, so I hope he likes it.

191
00:16:34,640 --> 00:16:37,000
I like it anyway.
 Won't he use it so ...

192
00:16:37,096 --> 00:16:39,480
It is such a gift that you really wanted.

193
00:16:39,560 --> 00:16:45,450
I kind of wanted to have this now, but yes ... so it is to him.

194
00:16:45,880 --> 00:16:50,800
Alma has wanted such a set of "rhinestones."

195
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:58,400
I don't know if you see it through the plastic, but there are small crystals that you glue on ...

196
00:16:58,480 --> 00:17:00,240
In lots of different colors.

197
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:03,480
... on type mobile shell, or you can put them on bags, shoes and so on.

198
00:17:03,560 --> 00:17:08,400
Here is some applicantor and here is a big tweezers that belongs.

199
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:11,240
She's a great point on this so, yes ...

200
00:17:11,335 --> 00:17:13,400
It will be interesting to see what her shoes look like later.

201
00:17:13,480 --> 00:17:18,720
- Yes.
 These were the three gifts that we feel we can show.
 - Yes.

202
00:17:18,812 --> 00:17:22,200
- And now we're going to hit them.
 - Yes, we will.

203
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:32,800
Once upon a time, I was very good at wrapping packages because I worked at NK as a clerk.

204
00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:36,240
But yes.
 No longer.

205
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:39,240
- You lost it a bit.
 - Yes, God.
 Are you kidding?

206
00:17:39,320 --> 00:17:43,560
We had to take a package wrapping course, we who worked at NK.

207
00:17:43,640 --> 00:17:47,000
- Because it would go fast or be neat?
 - Because it would be beautiful.

208
00:17:47,080 --> 00:17:50,090
So, what is this strange picture?
 You just see the bed.

209
00:17:50,210 --> 00:17:56,190
- But it was meant to see the packages.
 - God, then.

210
00:17:56,250 --> 00:17:59,380
- We can raise a little.
 - Give me the tape.

211
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:03,400
Now it is fully complained.

212
00:18:03,640 --> 00:18:06,400
Yes, but see.
 So there.

213
00:18:06,759 --> 00:18:09,080
Oh, the wall looks green, I think.

214
00:18:09,160 --> 00:18:14,000
What do you think at home?
 Does it look green or blue?
 It is blue.

215
00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:26,800
So there.

216
00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:31,400
They have neither short nor names written.

217
00:18:31,809 --> 00:18:35,320
No its true.
 Should we fix it, right?

218
00:18:35,560 --> 00:18:37,480
Oh!

219
00:18:37,640 --> 00:18:43,720
They may well have to guess and think.
 They are allowed to sit here and dream away in the Christmas tree.

220
00:18:43,800 --> 00:18:45,880
It is good.

221
00:18:47,160 --> 00:18:52,000
This became a fairly slow and extended vlog over several days.

222
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:56,080
Yes, and I think it was pretty nice for us to do such a vlog.

223
00:18:56,186 --> 00:18:59,560
It has been quite stressful and hot during the fall.

224
00:18:59,640 --> 00:19:06,513
Yes indeed.
 It has been a lot of projects and travel and everything we have had for us.

225
00:19:06,560 --> 00:19:09,080
You have had a lot in school too, and with training and so on.

226
00:19:09,180 --> 00:19:12,320
- And I've written a book.
 - Yes!

227
00:19:12,408 --> 00:19:13,720
So good!

228
00:19:13,800 --> 00:19:17,240
And club and Kenya and, yes.

229
00:19:17,333 --> 00:19:22,640
Yes.
 So it felt quite right to just slow down for Christmas and just run a little quiet pace.

230
00:19:22,736 --> 00:19:25,880
I started to wonder if it was this camera that made us a little slower.

231
00:19:25,965 --> 00:19:29,320
I do not know.
 What do you think who has looked?
 Is it "slow"?

232
00:19:29,413 --> 00:19:35,800
You may have to leave a comment about the sound, about the picture, and about the camera and ...

233
00:19:35,880 --> 00:19:38,320
- What you like and what you dislike.
 - Yes exactly.

234
00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:42,240
And in conclusion, we wish everyone a ...

235
00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:45,880
MERRY CHRISTMAS!

236
00:19:45,976 --> 00:19:51,200
Yeah.
 And of course we see you before New Year's Eve.

237
00:19:53,811 --> 00:20:00,560
Thanks for watching this video!

238
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:05,160
Feel free to leave a thumbs up, or down.

239
00:20:05,240 --> 00:20:08,720
Comment, ask questions and have a great time until we see you next time.

240
00:20:08,800 --> 00:20:11,800
- See you!
 - Bye!
