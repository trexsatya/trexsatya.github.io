1
00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:02.756
How to fund your growth.

2
00:00:03.113 --> 00:00:06.551
We will now talk about financing and financing options.

3
00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:10.066
Is it that the business does not finance itself

4
00:00:10.323 --> 00:00:13.962
or that you want to grow faster than with your own profit-

5
00:00:14.207 --> 00:00:17.500
You may need to find other ways to finance growth.

6
00:00:17.823 --> 00:00:21.540
Often there is a combination of different forms of financing.

7
00:00:21.953 --> 00:00:26.417
We at Almi are experts in putting this financing puzzle.

8
00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:31.216
We will take a closer look at loans, development funds and ownership capital

9
00:00:31.372 --> 00:00:34.162
And their respective advantages and disadvantages.

10
00:00:34.609 --> 00:00:36.283
We start with loans.

11
00:00:37.131 --> 00:00:40.502
Here is a selection of the banks and loan institutions

12
00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:42.589
found on the market today.

13
00:00:42.767 --> 00:00:45.625
Depending on the type of business form you choose

14
00:00:45.892 --> 00:00:49.040
the amounts can vary on how much you can borrow.

15
00:00:49.642 --> 00:00:52.433
Almi has a market supplementary role

16
00:00:52.667 --> 00:00:56.618
and lends out together with a bank or other loan institution.

17
00:00:56.875 --> 00:00:59.560
You can also borrow for the ongoing business

18
00:00:59.676 --> 00:01:03.080
To smooth out tops and valleys in your company's cash flow-

19
00:01:03.240 --> 00:01:05.360
And create an extra security.

20
00:01:05.602 --> 00:01:08.120
There are different options when your business

21
00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:10.468
need reinforced liquidity-

22
00:01:10.625 --> 00:01:15.290
For example, to manage expenses before you get paid yourself.

23
00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:19.360
The advantage of loans is that you keep control of the company

24
00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:22.187
But the company needs to have stable revenue-

25
00:01:22.321 --> 00:01:25.080
To be able to pay interest and amortization.

26
00:01:25.446 --> 00:01:28.560
The second way is to look at development funds.

27
00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:31.560
Competition for these agents is often great

28
00:01:31.796 --> 00:01:35.680
and here we recommend that you talk to your adviser at Almi-

29
00:01:35.881 --> 00:01:39.440
So we look at what different opportunities are for you.

30
00:01:39.910 --> 00:01:43.816
They have regional business support, checks from the Growth Agency

31
00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:46.720
and vinnova, verification agent from almi-

32
00:01:46.852 --> 00:01:49.341
And EU grants, to name a few.

33
00:01:49.687 --> 00:01:51.840
What one can search for varies

34
00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:55.240
So it is important to monitor the various organizations.

35
00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:58.805
The benefits associated with development agents

36
00:01:59.029 --> 00:02:01.720
is that no refund is required.

37
00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:05.680
However, this type of financing is often detailed controlled

38
00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:10.520
And earmarked for certain efforts, processes and collaborations.

39
00:02:10.926 --> 00:02:14.160
It is therefore important to understand about a means of development

40
00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:19.240
benefits the business and is in line with what you want to develop.

41
00:02:19.587 --> 00:02:22.240
In some cases, counter -financing may be required

42
00:02:22.377 --> 00:02:26.600
Or its own efforts from the person seeking this type of means.

43
00:02:27.075 --> 00:02:31.640
The last form of financing that we will go through is ownership capital.

44
00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:37.287
Owner capital means that you as an owner go in with financing

45
00:02:37.421 --> 00:02:40.720
Or that you let part -owners into the company.

46
00:02:40.915 --> 00:02:43.537
Here you talk even about private venture capital

47
00:02:43.727 --> 00:02:48.440
which you can find among other things with business angels and venture capital companies.

48
00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:52.142
The type of company that is usually relevant to owner capital

49
00:02:52.377 --> 00:02:54.880
are those who have a scalable business model-

50
00:02:54.988 --> 00:02:59.640
with international potential.
 Advantages of owner-capital-

51
00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:02.920
is that you get external skills into the company-

52
00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:06.880
competence and capital in one person.

53
00:03:07.254 --> 00:03:09.720
If you choose this route it is required that you are willing

54
00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:13.772
to release control and let someone else be with and determine-

55
00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:16.000
about where the company should go.

56
00:03:16.785 --> 00:03:20.800
Here you can see some alternatives on owner capital and venture capital.

57
00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:22.734
It's everything from family and friends

58
00:03:22.845 --> 00:03:25.880
to business angels and larger venture capital companies.

59
00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:28.280
We should not leave owner capital right yet

60
00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:31.720
without we want to highlight some points that are important to think-

61
00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:33.960
when you take in new owners.

62
00:03:34.631 --> 00:03:38.200
First and foremost, choose new owners with care.

63
00:03:38.627 --> 00:03:40.446
It's not just about capital

64
00:03:40.602 --> 00:03:43.000
A new owner becomes your future partner.

65
00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:47.440
You need to find a good combination between competence and capital

66
00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:49.330
In order to benefit the business-

67
00:03:49.464 --> 00:03:52.700
And you need to agree on the goal of ownership.

68
00:03:53.303 --> 00:03:55.440
The next point is about valuation.

69
00:03:55.669 --> 00:03:58.270
There are different ways to evaluate your business

70
00:03:58.671 --> 00:04:02.320
And here it is good to take the help of an economic adviser.

71
00:04:02.645 --> 00:04:04.587
You need to find a value for the company

72
00:04:04.676 --> 00:04:09.062
which corresponds to your and the new owner's image of the company.

73
00:04:09.341 --> 00:04:11.908
Think about what values your business has.

74
00:04:12.243 --> 00:04:16.529
Are there values beyond the financial such as patents

75
00:04:16.986 --> 00:04:18.560
In a negotiation with a new owner

76
00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:22.040
Do you need to justify and describe the assets in the company-

77
00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:24.400
that make up your valuation.

78
00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:28.800
The last point is about structure.

79
00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:32.200
Structure is extra important when you become several owners

80
00:04:32.299 --> 00:04:34.560
So you can work towards the same goal.

81
00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:37.320
In a limited company there are some formalia

82
00:04:37.388 --> 00:04:39.810
that facilitates your joint work.

83
00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:45.600
These are documents such as owner directives, rules of procedure for the board and the CEO.

84
00:04:46.205 --> 00:04:48.480
Formulate owner directive together

85
00:04:48.640 --> 00:04:53.002
so it is clear what the owners want the company to work against-

86
00:04:53.236 --> 00:04:56.171
as well as the rules of procedure for board and CEO

87
00:04:56.350 --> 00:04:59.360
to ensure that the board works towards the owners' goals.

88
00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:04.375
In the in -depth part you will find a link to Fredrik SjÃ¶vall from Hemcheck

89
00:05:04.687 --> 00:05:07.800
And how they reason around external capital.

90
00:05:08.390 --> 00:05:11.068
As an entrepreneur, it is easy to feel alone.

91
00:05:11.639 --> 00:05:14.056
You have to take help as the company grows.

92
00:05:14.548 --> 00:05:17.689
A coach or mentor and in the long term a board

93
00:05:17.713 --> 00:05:20.941
can be a great way to get external skills-

94
00:05:21.117 --> 00:05:23.072
that engages in the company.

95
00:05:23.788 --> 00:05:27.748
Having an external ball plan can relieve many of the questions

96
00:05:27.811 --> 00:05:31.556
Which you go and think about.
 When looking for external skills-

97
00:05:31.638 --> 00:05:34.945
Do you have to find people who complement yourself-

98
00:05:35.193 --> 00:05:37.748
And the people who are in the company.

99
00:05:38.113 --> 00:05:42.054
It is easy to be drawn to someone who thinks and thinks as you yourself.

100
00:05:42.624 --> 00:05:45.746
A board person, an Advisory Board

101
00:05:45.887 --> 00:05:50.325
Coach or mentor does not have to be a long -term commitment.

102
00:05:50.602 --> 00:05:54.525
Each phase in entrepreneurship needs different skills

103
00:05:54.656 --> 00:05:57.357
and it is important to identify skills and networks-

104
00:05:57.430 --> 00:06:01.927
Which is good for the phase in which the company is now.

105
00:06:04.724 --> 00:06:06.878
A mentor acts as a ball board

106
00:06:06.951 --> 00:06:10.746
that guides you forward to facilitate your business-

107
00:06:10.808 --> 00:06:13.099
Development and growth process.

108
00:06:13.455 --> 00:06:17.884
A board member has personal responsibility for the company's administration.

109
00:06:18.825 --> 00:06:21.253
There are also other actors and organizations

110
00:06:21.345 --> 00:06:26.546
who can relieve, of course, as consultants, advisors within accounting-

111
00:06:26.706 --> 00:06:29.964
and auditing, as well as various public actors.

112
00:06:30.199 --> 00:06:33.529
Now it's time for you to work on your own.

113
00:06:34.037 --> 00:06:36.283
We have talked about wanting and daring.

114
00:06:36.568 --> 00:06:40.968
Decide, where do you want with your company in 35 years?

115
00:06:41.190 --> 00:06:42.990
Let the passion control.

116
00:06:43.610 --> 00:06:47.171
Set clear and smart goals for the way there.

117
00:06:47.461 --> 00:06:51.673
Keep focus and build simple systems and routines from the start.

118
00:06:51.915 --> 00:06:55.150
Then you lay the foundation to expand your business.

119
00:06:55.449 --> 00:06:59.886
Make the staff participate and motivated in the company's growth.

120
00:07:00.250 --> 00:07:02.699
Take the help of financing experts.

121
00:07:02.886 --> 00:07:04.671
There are different types of funding

122
00:07:04.763 --> 00:07:07.563
depending on in which phase you are located-

123
00:07:07.705 --> 00:07:10.638
And sometimes it can be difficult to find the right one.

124
00:07:11.800 --> 00:07:14.378
Big thanks for being with us this moment.

125
00:07:14.679 --> 00:07:17.439
We hope you got some inspiration and new ideas

126
00:07:17.507 --> 00:07:19.707
For how to take the next step.

127
00:07:20.052 --> 00:07:22.941
One way might be to look at our other seminars

128
00:07:22.966 --> 00:07:26.273
which you can find on the website.
 Good luck!
