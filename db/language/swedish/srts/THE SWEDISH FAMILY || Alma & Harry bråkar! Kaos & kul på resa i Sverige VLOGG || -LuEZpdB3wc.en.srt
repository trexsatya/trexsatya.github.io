1
00:00:00,067 --> 00:00:02,837
(Shoulder) sn*pp, cool.
 That was not me.

2
00:00:03,003 --> 00:00:06,138
From chaos comes order, and quite fun moments.

3
00:00:06,649 --> 00:00:10,777
- You can stop calm, because you are destroying everything!
 You make us go into ... - (Harry screams)

4
00:00:18,784 --> 00:00:25,778
Good morning.
 Here we sit, in a parking lot, in Stenstorp.

5
00:00:25,993 --> 00:00:29,196
We discover Skaraborg this week.

6
00:00:29,498 --> 00:00:33,297
Harry, can't you sit up and be with a little?

7
00:00:33,678 --> 00:00:39,196
We took the car here today, and Alma and Harry started to cheat in the car.

8
00:00:39,733 --> 00:00:42,924
So when we arrived, they went in each direction in the parking lot.

9
00:00:43,177 --> 00:00:50,448
Alma went away.
 Axel and Laura followed.
 And here Harry sat down, and I followed Harry.

10
00:00:50,618 --> 00:00:53,521
Now the others come.

11
00:00:54,525 --> 00:00:56,985
- Hello.
 - Hello.

12
00:00:57,413 --> 00:01:01,495
- It's been a bit noisy.
 - I know.

13
00:01:01,692 --> 00:01:07,501
Welcome to the parking lot.
 Or, the small lawn next to the parking lot.

14
00:01:07,668 --> 00:01:11,005
- in Stenstorp.
 - I know, I know.

15
00:01:11,172 --> 00:01:14,241
Listen, can't you be the same?

16
00:01:14,341 --> 00:01:16,510
- please?
 - Please please?

17
00:01:16,610 --> 00:01:20,616
- Can't we bury the battle ax?
 - (Harry) okay.

18
00:01:20,948 --> 00:01:22,615
(Alma) okay.

19
00:01:40,723 --> 00:01:43,889
- (Axel) Hug!
 - (Alma) hugs!

20
00:01:46,473 --> 00:01:52,474
Now we are going here, at the Dalénium Science Center.

21
00:01:52,879 --> 00:01:57,754
(Axel) please!
 Oh, Harry holds up the door.
 Brilliant.

22
00:01:58,052 --> 00:01:59,186
(Axel) Hi, Hi!

23
00:01:59,253 --> 00:02:01,989
- (Woman) Hello, and welcome!
 - Thanks so much.

24
00:02:02,056 --> 00:02:06,323
- (man) 1, 2, 3, 4. There is no one.
 - (Axel) Yes, he held up the door.

25
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:10,497
- (woman) a gentleman.
 Welcome to Dalénium!
 - Thanks!

26
00:02:10,574 --> 00:02:14,068
This is a "science center".
 Do you know what it is?

27
00:02:14,164 --> 00:02:17,504
- (Harry) No.
 - Yes a little.
 Type.

28
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:18,973
(The woman) a little.
 Yes.

29
00:02:19,062 --> 00:02:24,714
There are 20 science center in Sweden and many abroad.
 We do about the same things.

30
00:02:24,912 --> 00:02:29,350
There are lots of try-on stuff and experiments, we also have shows,-

31
00:02:29,545 --> 00:02:35,439
-Kring slightly different phenomena and properties in the field of technical and science.

32
00:02:39,704 --> 00:02:43,745
Oh ... Check out here.

33
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:47,025
Ah, I understand.

34
00:02:49,874 --> 00:02:52,106
May I join and play?

35
00:02:52,230 --> 00:02:55,809
- (alma) "pipe organs."
 - Wait, I'll take my own.

36
00:03:12,530 --> 00:03:17,014
- (Joanna) Oh, Laura dances to.
 - (Alma) Yes!

37
00:03:17,289 --> 00:03:20,320
- Dad, your slippers.
 - Thanks.

38
00:03:20,580 --> 00:03:23,334
- Come on, then we move on.
 - Yes!

39
00:03:30,477 --> 00:03:35,034
- What are you going to do?
 - A F.

40
00:03:35,372 --> 00:03:38,986
- So.
 - Yes, smart.

41
00:03:39,053 --> 00:03:43,357
And then so.
 Now.
 Now, now, now!

42
00:03:44,691 --> 00:03:45,959
Yellow.

43
00:03:46,126 --> 00:03:47,194
Green.

44
00:03:47,361 --> 00:03:48,595
Black.

45
00:03:48,769 --> 00:03:50,030
Blue.

46
00:03:50,197 --> 00:03:51,675
Pink.

47
00:03:55,082 --> 00:03:56,629
Yes!

48
00:03:57,152 --> 00:03:58,876
Yes, there.

49
00:03:59,106 --> 00:04:04,194
- There was something else to look at.
 - The fine, red lamp.
 It was fine.

50
00:04:04,979 --> 00:04:09,155
- (Alma) Are you there?
 - (Harry) Hello?

51
00:04:09,316 --> 00:04:12,419
- Oh my good, it works!
 - (Axel) Can I hear?

52
00:04:12,501 --> 00:04:14,640
(Harry) Oh my good.

53
00:04:15,944 --> 00:04:20,037
(Harry) Jesus Christ, then!
 Oh my God.

54
00:04:20,516 --> 00:04:24,698
- (Alma) God, this is so cool.
 - (Harry) Yes, it's great fun!

55
00:04:24,848 --> 00:04:27,483
Harry is standing over there.

56
00:04:28,857 --> 00:04:30,572
♪ (music) ♪

57
00:05:11,225 --> 00:05:13,605
1, 2, 3!

58
00:05:14,935 --> 00:05:20,687
I think this has been a top activity when it's so hot outside.

59
00:05:20,987 --> 00:05:25,492
I feel that I am very tired of all the brain gym.

60
00:05:25,634 --> 00:05:30,001
I'm not used to gymnastizing these parts up here.

61
00:05:30,197 --> 00:05:32,232
I think it's easier for children.

62
00:05:32,366 --> 00:05:35,802
A lot!
 They are up and running here, they build and fix.

63
00:05:35,934 --> 00:05:40,407
Alma builds some house for Laura, with the help of some newfound friends.

64
00:05:40,574 --> 00:05:44,911
And I have to say that it has been a great activity for two noisy siblings-

65
00:05:44,994 --> 00:05:48,248
-For they have had to collaborate and find things together in here.

66
00:05:48,315 --> 00:05:49,283
Mm.

67
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:54,637
- The brawl from this morning is forgotten.
 - Yes.
 A little difficult to film in this environment.

68
00:05:54,788 --> 00:06:00,861
Yes.
 I really think that we end up in situations that are difficult to film, and so just ...

69
00:06:01,048 --> 00:06:04,372
"God, what have we really brought with us from here? Aaah ..."

70
00:06:04,531 --> 00:06:07,064
- Yes, and so it will be what it will be.
 - mm.

71
00:06:10,717 --> 00:06:13,787
This is Laura's house!

72
00:06:13,974 --> 00:06:16,677
- Does she like it?
 - I think so.

73
00:06:16,843 --> 00:06:18,917
- Is that the bed?
 - Yes.

74
00:06:19,012 --> 00:06:23,237
- Oh, it looks a little small.
 - No.

75
00:06:26,015 --> 00:06:30,309
(Harry) and I have made two cars for Laura.

76
00:06:30,952 --> 00:06:39,038
- Great to have a little acid you can build!
 - Yes.
 The super top.

77
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:47,164
- Has she tested them?
 - I think she will like this most.

78
00:06:47,340 --> 00:06:52,076
But what is Dad doing now, then?
 What's that?

79
00:06:52,212 --> 00:06:59,842
It's a long spring.
 You can learn about waves and how they propagate.

80
00:07:01,563 --> 00:07:04,791
(Alma) Laura, this is your car.

81
00:07:04,974 --> 00:07:08,635
Ready Set Go!

82
00:07:13,622 --> 00:07:15,622
How was it?

83
00:07:15,979 --> 00:07:19,803
So good!
 It was so funny!

84
00:07:20,662 --> 00:07:26,610
- So what do you think?
 - I think it was fun.
 Really fun.

85
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:28,949
- The car is here!
 - (Joanna) huh?!

86
00:07:29,015 --> 00:07:33,192
Yes, I have prepped a bit, huh.
 As in cooking TV when they have already baked the bread.

87
00:07:33,253 --> 00:07:36,100
Are you prepping this too?

88
00:07:36,156 --> 00:07:37,257
#Sn*pp #cool

89
00:07:37,324 --> 00:07:43,163
That was not me, but I wrote #cool because I miss my old hat with #cool.

90
00:07:43,247 --> 00:07:46,032
Or, it wasn't mine.
 It was really Almas.

91
00:07:46,132 --> 00:07:50,537
- (Joanna) and who is #sn*pp?
 - (Axel) I don't know.

92
00:07:50,670 --> 00:07:52,172
- Harry.
 - No.

93
00:07:52,272 --> 00:07:56,555
It was not me!
 I don't write that ugly!

94
00:07:58,735 --> 00:08:00,914
This with #cool ...

95
00:08:01,014 --> 00:08:09,923
So it was a - Sorry, Alma - very ugly hat that Alma had, which Axel wore once when we recorded.

96
00:08:10,090 --> 00:08:14,427
I used it for quite some time.
 I had gotten rid of my hat.

97
00:08:14,694 --> 00:08:20,867
- (Laura makes a long scream) - I know, it was terrible.

98
00:08:21,001 --> 00:08:23,536
It is in some vlog.
 I just don't remember what it's called.

99
00:08:23,603 --> 00:08:24,622
Neither do I.

100
00:08:24,671 --> 00:08:27,240
- It's so long ago.
 - You have to look.

101
00:08:27,307 --> 00:08:34,512
In all cases.
 Now we are on our way to a place called Maplelake, where we will live tonight.

102
00:08:34,648 --> 00:08:35,727
Yes!

103
00:08:35,835 --> 00:08:37,835
♪ (music) ♪

104
00:08:47,347 --> 00:08:51,536
Check.
 Here we will live.

105
00:08:54,000 --> 00:09:00,073
- (Harry) I sleep here.
 PAX LOCK!
 - "PAX LOCK ..." Wonder if we should all live in a tent.

106
00:09:00,206 --> 00:09:05,592
- I hope it's both, but I don't know.
 - We'll see.

107
00:09:05,806 --> 00:09:08,412
(Harry) Oh, check out!

108
00:09:09,929 --> 00:09:13,197
(Axel) Oh ... Nämen!

109
00:09:13,353 --> 00:09:15,922
Dad.
 Your favorite sport.

110
00:09:16,100 --> 00:09:23,027
This was cozy!
 Oh, wow!
 "Speed badminton".
 Wow!

111
00:09:23,363 --> 00:09:28,050
(Joanna) And so there is a small fan there and hum.
 It is well hot in this tent.

112
00:09:28,187 --> 00:09:32,572
- (Alma) Yes.
 - (Axel) It will probably get cooler towards the evening.

113
00:09:32,672 --> 00:09:35,875
- Should we guess that this is for Laura, right?
 - Yes I think so.

114
00:09:35,975 --> 00:09:38,346
Or should we squeeze all in here?

115
00:09:38,449 --> 00:09:42,282
- I do not know.
 No, it will probably get a little too crowded.
 - Alma and I sleep here.

116
00:09:42,382 --> 00:09:50,857
- Laura, who fell asleep in the car.
 We haven't just left her.
 - No.
 Or, yes.
 But she sleeps so well.

117
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:52,692
- Candy.
 - No.

118
00:09:52,792 --> 00:09:53,927
- Drink.
 - No.

119
00:09:53,993 --> 00:09:59,499
- Smoothie to Laura.
 - It was good, but the other you can save for Saturday.

120
00:09:59,658 --> 00:10:00,635
Come!

121
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:03,737
- Hello Hello!
 Welcome here.
 - Thanks!

122
00:10:03,837 --> 00:10:06,575
- Fun that you are here.
 - It feels good to be here.

123
00:10:06,673 --> 00:10:10,744
How nice.
 Have you been to Tidaholm before?

124
00:10:10,877 --> 00:10:15,348
Never.
 We have no idea what is happening here.

125
00:10:15,515 --> 00:10:20,253
It's a small town, but there is some to do anyway.
 It is good.

126
00:10:20,335 --> 00:10:22,812
Yes.
 How cozy.

127
00:10:22,922 --> 00:10:29,129
To begin with ... I don't know how sucked you are right now, but here is a bit for the boat trip.

128
00:10:29,195 --> 00:10:33,700
Or if you feel, "No, God. We can't bear to paddle a meter before ..."

129
00:10:33,833 --> 00:10:36,769
- But what a wonderful!
 - A little coffee and fruit.

130
00:10:36,870 --> 00:10:42,000
Oh, how nice!
 The kids just: "Oh, oh, oh, mmm, yeah!"

131
00:10:43,309 --> 00:10:46,346
Okay.
 Both tents are ours.

132
00:10:46,513 --> 00:10:53,740
This was intended as a parent tent, and the other is bedded for the children.

133
00:10:53,887 --> 00:10:56,890
We will have to do some kind of rocked.

134
00:10:56,949 --> 00:10:57,957
Yes!

135
00:10:58,091 --> 00:11:03,196
But this is great fun, because this campsite is in the middle of town, Tidaholm.

136
00:11:03,296 --> 00:11:03,796
(Shoulder) mm.

137
00:11:03,863 --> 00:11:08,034
So we will live in a tent in a city with 12,000 inhabitants.

138
00:11:08,149 --> 00:11:10,236
- It will be great fun!
 - It's a bit unique?

139
00:11:10,288 --> 00:11:12,672
A whole new experience.

140
00:11:12,775 --> 00:11:16,843
We have not made this booking ourselves, just like in the last video.

141
00:11:17,024 --> 00:11:20,991
We make this trip in collaboration with Visit Skaraborg.

142
00:11:21,181 --> 00:11:25,485
No!
 Experience Skaraborg.
 But it is kind of the same thing.

143
00:11:25,618 --> 00:11:27,520
And here comes a little troll.

144
00:11:27,642 --> 00:11:32,678
- Yes, which I think is a little boat suck.
 - I think so too.

145
00:11:38,252 --> 00:11:40,199
What are you laughing at?

146
00:11:40,366 --> 00:11:42,735
Harry just said I'm a sn*pp band.

147
00:11:42,802 --> 00:11:50,103
I told him he needs to have this sn*PP band.
 He just: "You're a sn*PP band!"

148
00:11:50,343 --> 00:11:54,347
So, sometimes things happen between the shoots that are quite fun.

149
00:11:54,506 --> 00:11:58,233
Now we will go boat.

150
00:11:58,873 --> 00:12:03,122
The boat is just 50 meters from our tents.

151
00:12:03,289 --> 00:12:06,192
This will be exciting.

152
00:12:06,893 --> 00:12:12,838
"Going a boat" was a bit ... exaggerated.
 We are actually going out and quiet.

153
00:12:12,966 --> 00:12:15,068
- On this river.
 - Yes.

154
00:12:15,190 --> 00:12:21,095
- called Tidan, and goes through Tidaholm.
 - Yes.

155
00:12:22,832 --> 00:12:27,388
Good!
 Professional, Harry.
 Here comes a year!

156
00:12:27,598 --> 00:12:32,393
- "Don't Kill Me."
 (Don't kill me.) - No, I'm not going to kill you.

157
00:12:34,545 --> 00:12:38,975
- No, we are wrong.
 - Nämen, now you back.

158
00:12:39,125 --> 00:12:42,161
Wait, Harry.
 Stop.

159
00:12:42,340 --> 00:12:44,696
Harry, stop!

160
00:12:45,665 --> 00:12:48,833
Shouldn't I be resting instead?

161
00:12:54,565 --> 00:12:59,011
It looks like Harry thinks you should row together.

162
00:12:59,260 --> 00:13:03,015
- We spin around, at least.
 - Yes, but ...

163
00:13:03,182 --> 00:13:08,464
In circles.
 Now we go back.
 Hello, the bridge.

164
00:13:08,621 --> 00:13:19,154
- If we go there, as you said, then this is right.
 - Alma has to calm a little more.
 Come on, Alma!
 Take in.

165
00:13:21,170 --> 00:13:24,504
Harry, stop peace like me!

166
00:13:24,670 --> 00:13:28,654
You can just stop peace, because you are destroying everything!
 You make us go into ...

167
00:13:28,654 --> 00:13:30,676
- (Harry screams) - ... the stone.

168
00:13:30,877 --> 00:13:34,274
- This is a great group exercise.
 - (Joanna) Yes.

169
00:13:34,413 --> 00:13:36,762
- (Harry) It's not at all.
 - (Axel) yes!

170
00:13:36,967 --> 00:13:38,967
♪ (music) ♪

171
00:14:25,480 --> 00:14:28,734
- That got pretty good in the end.
 - Yes, it was really nice.

172
00:14:28,801 --> 00:14:31,671
- It just started a little chaotic.
 - Yes.

173
00:14:31,737 --> 00:14:34,240
- Just like our day.
 - Yes.

174
00:14:34,307 --> 00:14:39,098
- "Just like our life," I was saying.
 - Yes exactly.
 Just like our entire life.

175
00:14:39,178 --> 00:14:43,416
From chaos comes order, and quite fun moments.
 Kind of like that.

176
00:14:43,482 --> 00:14:44,417
Yes.

177
00:14:44,489 --> 00:14:48,955
- Now we're going to check ... there.
 - In a restaurant.

178
00:14:49,055 --> 00:14:52,825
- called "La Familia".
 It suits us.
 - Hang on!

179
00:14:52,953 --> 00:14:58,230
Yes, hook on.
 I think Alma and Harry are very hungry, because it is so quiet here.

180
00:14:58,297 --> 00:15:03,229
- And a little tired, I think.
 - Yes.
 It's tough to have summer vacation.

181
00:15:03,569 --> 00:15:05,338
- Hello!
 - Hello!
 Welcome!

182
00:15:05,404 --> 00:15:08,808
- Thanks!
 How's it going?
 - Great!
 How about you?

183
00:15:08,874 --> 00:15:13,407
- Well thanks.
 Is it your restaurant?
 - Yes, it's mine.

184
00:15:13,446 --> 00:15:14,834
- Lovely!
 - Hello!

185
00:15:15,315 --> 00:15:18,684
God, what a cute!

186
00:15:19,185 --> 00:15:25,057
- You got an antenna when you took off the hood.
 - Yes.
 It is Joanna that is fascinated by hair hairstyles.

187
00:15:25,142 --> 00:15:28,861
- (Harry) No, it went down.
 - Yes, I felt it just ...

188
00:15:28,948 --> 00:15:31,831
Did you pull up the hood just to be a little anonymous when you entered the tavern?

189
00:15:31,897 --> 00:15:34,783
Yes.
 The first thing that happens is that four moms ...

190
00:15:34,834 --> 00:15:38,604
- Do you want me to put together two tables?
 - This will be great, thank you.

191
00:15:38,671 --> 00:15:40,006
This will be perfect.

192
00:15:40,106 --> 00:15:44,004
- As I said ... - The first thing that happens is to four moms ...

193
00:15:44,143 --> 00:15:53,133
Four moms just: "It's like getting a little starstruck!"
 I didn't even have to ... I didn't even go past them.

194
00:15:53,395 --> 00:15:57,319
(Joanna) Thanks, please.
 Menu.

195
00:15:57,529 --> 00:16:00,822
- Thanks so much.
 Great.
 - So there.
 Then you have to look a little there.

196
00:16:03,463 --> 00:16:10,132
- (Axel) Oh, what good with food.
 - (Joanna) Sooo tasty.

197
00:16:15,763 --> 00:16:20,346
Oh my God, what a cheese pizza!

198
00:16:20,679 --> 00:16:25,719
And gluten -free, to Alma's great happiness.

199
00:16:26,128 --> 00:16:28,398
(Shoulder) SuperMight.

200
00:16:30,268 --> 00:16:34,894
We have just done ourselves at this center behind it.

201
00:16:34,960 --> 00:16:39,874
There are type kitchens, laundry rooms, toilets, showers, and stuff.

202
00:16:39,965 --> 00:16:43,935
And now let's go back to our tent and sleep.

203
00:16:44,197 --> 00:16:49,074
- (Joanna) How are we going to sleep, then?
 - We will sleep girl tents and tents.

204
00:16:49,176 --> 00:16:50,609
- (Axel, Hest) huh?!
 - Yes.

205
00:16:50,676 --> 00:16:54,727
- What was that voice?!
 - (shoulder, crash) "huh?!"

206
00:16:54,942 --> 00:17:01,331
(Light voice) "I'm a girl."
 (Regular voice) No, but I like to sleep with Harry!

207
00:17:01,569 --> 00:17:07,323
- And I like to sleep with Alma and Laurita.
 - Yes.

208
00:17:08,108 --> 00:17:12,772
- Then we take it with three, then.
 - Yes.

209
00:17:13,129 --> 00:17:17,703
(Joanna) Oh!
 Now someone drives by with the worst music.

210
00:17:19,768 --> 00:17:23,742
Yes, there is a lot of raggers here, that is.

211
00:17:25,859 --> 00:17:29,596
Laura just: "What was it?"

212
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:34,350
(Axel) Now we are there.
 Here you live.

213
00:17:44,595 --> 00:17:47,047
- (Axel) Good night, then!
 - (Joanna) Good night!

214
00:17:47,819 --> 00:17:51,170
- It's been a few days.
 - And now Harry is not with us.

215
00:17:51,303 --> 00:17:52,226
No.

216
00:17:52,440 --> 00:17:55,841
But we slept in the tents.
 How was it, Alma?

217
00:17:56,007 --> 00:18:02,424
It was very very, very, very cold.
 Then it was really, giant, giant, giant, very hot.

218
00:18:02,514 --> 00:18:06,001
- As it is to sleep in tents.
 Even when they are smaller.
 - Yes.

219
00:18:06,118 --> 00:18:09,088
Then in the morning we got a great breakfast basket,-

220
00:18:09,187 --> 00:18:15,884
-And I posted on our Instagram Stories where we were and where we had slept, and then people started.

221
00:18:15,961 --> 00:18:20,332
- Very, very, a lot of people.
 - Yes, from all directions.

222
00:18:20,399 --> 00:18:26,672
- In Tidaholm.
 - Yes.
 And I walked around in underwear with my hair on end.

223
00:18:26,839 --> 00:18:31,977
Yes, it was very difficult for us to film something more there, because it just happened all the time.

224
00:18:32,075 --> 00:18:34,513
In the end, we had to go on, so ...

225
00:18:34,580 --> 00:18:38,250
We kind of got a little panic.
 Or, we were shocked and just, "God!"

226
00:18:38,317 --> 00:18:43,689
Yes, we were shocked.
 But everyone was very nice, it wasn't.
 It just got a little much.

227
00:18:43,766 --> 00:18:44,957
- Yes.
 - Yes.

228
00:18:45,076 --> 00:18:48,840
And then we would go on in Skaraborg, so yes ... So it was.

229
00:18:48,994 --> 00:18:54,667
Thanks for watching this video!

230
00:18:54,833 --> 00:19:00,880
- Feel free to leave a thumbs up, or down.
 - Most thumbs up!

231
00:19:00,973 --> 00:19:04,476
- Comment, ask questions, and have a great time until we see you next time.
 - See you!

232
00:19:04,628 --> 00:19:07,346
Bye!
