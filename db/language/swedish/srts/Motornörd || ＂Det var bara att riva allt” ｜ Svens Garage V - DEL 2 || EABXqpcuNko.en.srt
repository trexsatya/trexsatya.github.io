1
00:00:00,159 --> 00:00:01,736
What you done?

2
00:00:01,820 --> 00:00:03,595
After all, it was just tearing everything up.

3
00:00:03,680 --> 00:00:05,385
I see it, but you would just fix a little neighbor.

4
00:00:05,469 --> 00:00:08,616
Yes, it was probably the desire if you say.

5
00:00:08,699 --> 00:00:10,699
But no.

6
00:00:15,619 --> 00:00:16,256
Hello Hello!

7
00:00:16,340 --> 00:00:17,536
Hello Hello!

8
00:00:17,620 --> 00:00:19,516
Do you hear we were at Öland this summer.

9
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:21,375
Yes, very nice.

10
00:00:21,459 --> 00:00:23,572
Check out Pers Sarolea where you had built.

11
00:00:23,572 --> 00:00:25,530
You had some small fixes on yours.

12
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,610
Yes, it wasn't really like this I had imagined.

13
00:00:29,989 --> 00:00:34,159
The fun here is that we would use this motorcycle as a reference

14
00:00:34,470 --> 00:00:36,015
Before we went to Öland, so one would understand

15
00:00:36,099 --> 00:00:37,395
What it was.

16
00:00:37,479 --> 00:00:39,444
It was not intended that this should be a project.

17
00:00:39,444 --> 00:00:41,811
No, but it was.

18
00:00:41,811 --> 00:00:43,465
Yes, you see that it is still a motorcycle.

19
00:00:43,549 --> 00:00:45,305
But it is a little bit picked.

20
00:00:45,389 --> 00:00:47,436
After all, you had removed the lamp last.

21
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:49,076
Yes, I don't know.

22
00:00:49,159 --> 00:00:52,550
Probably they have built this mound for them to have it as a pedistal

23
00:00:52,650 --> 00:00:55,736
And just have something to look at because everything was resolved.

24
00:00:55,819 --> 00:00:57,819
Every screw, nut.

25
00:00:58,439 --> 00:01:01,229
I mean the connection and everything raged and.

26
00:01:02,650 --> 00:01:05,566
Yes then i did not get the charge up and then i have been doing

27
00:01:05,650 --> 00:01:08,650
And tried to get hold of a generator.

28
00:01:09,440 --> 00:01:12,496
But this is this, a Miller generator.

29
00:01:12,580 --> 00:01:17,760
Fairly common generator in England at BSA and Royal Enfield,

30
00:01:18,410 --> 00:01:21,699
But they always had their switches in the engine block.

31
00:01:22,559 --> 00:01:28,209
But Sarolea has her switch for the ignition then in the generator.

32
00:01:29,389 --> 00:01:33,166
So that generator is pretty rare because it's just sarolea

33
00:01:33,250 --> 00:01:34,905
that uses it.

34
00:01:34,989 --> 00:01:36,886
So the only generator I could find.

35
00:01:36,970 --> 00:01:40,730
I have tried to get mine started, but no, it is not possible.

36
00:01:41,269 --> 00:01:45,555
It is a bit special with because it sits only a coil in this

37
00:01:45,639 --> 00:01:49,660
so they must have a special charge regulator

38
00:01:50,629 --> 00:01:52,295
and it is a regulator that is constantly lying

39
00:01:52,379 --> 00:01:55,849
And pulses power into the winding.

40
00:01:57,019 --> 00:01:59,830
So a modern charge regulator does not work.

41
00:02:00,150 --> 00:02:05,779
So I bought a charge regulator, an electronic,

42
00:02:06,339 --> 00:02:08,339
And bought new winding.

43
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:10,925
But no, I didn't get that started.

44
00:02:11,009 --> 00:02:13,009
Don't charge anything.

45
00:02:13,160 --> 00:02:15,960
And I have checked that it is properly linked.

46
00:02:17,500 --> 00:02:19,500
And there is to buy.

47
00:02:20,039 --> 00:02:24,472
One has found Europe down in Belgium and then guy there.

48
00:02:24,472 --> 00:02:25,233
One?

49
00:02:25,233 --> 00:02:27,089
One, he had.

50
00:02:28,419 --> 00:02:30,669
But he knew it was unusual.

51
00:02:32,679 --> 00:02:37,199
12,000 plus tax plus shipping and a little.

52
00:02:38,619 --> 00:02:42,059
Yes.
 No, it's not that fun.

53
00:02:42,330 --> 00:02:44,705
I mean damn it is more than what half the bike is worth

54
00:02:44,789 --> 00:02:46,365
so to speak.

55
00:02:46,449 --> 00:02:48,925
So I went a bit and looked in the hides here in the garage

56
00:02:49,009 --> 00:02:51,380
And then I found an alternator generator.

57
00:02:52,320 --> 00:02:54,345
Admittedly 12 volts.

58
00:02:54,429 --> 00:02:56,629
But 12 volts are no problem, it just gets better.

59
00:02:56,740 --> 00:03:00,100
So I have reduced it as much as it ever goes.

60
00:03:01,110 --> 00:03:04,669
Used the gable on the old generator where the switches sit

61
00:03:05,610 --> 00:03:08,996
and made a small extension on the shoulder.

62
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:13,106
And yes, a small device so I get these drives there

63
00:03:13,190 --> 00:03:16,716
for there is an interchange with it so that it should the generator spin

64
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:18,800
twice as fast as the switch does.

65
00:03:19,220 --> 00:03:21,850
It is well because the generator needs a higher speed.

66
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:28,785
But after two weeks of crunching and turned and welded

67
00:03:28,869 --> 00:03:32,990
Well welded, yes, I have not done with much pill I have actually got it there.

68
00:03:33,350 --> 00:03:35,350
And there we have the generator.

69
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:38,750
This is how you can see the air intake.

70
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:43,895
There are small fans inside to take air out

71
00:03:43,979 --> 00:03:45,455
And circulate.

72
00:03:45,539 --> 00:03:47,740
Then I made a stainless steel cover.

73
00:03:48,889 --> 00:03:50,889
To get a more smooth surface.

74
00:03:51,690 --> 00:03:54,270
Have we had to cut it all the brackets and stuff.

75
00:03:55,460 --> 00:03:58,945
So this generator I have made my own screws

76
00:03:59,029 --> 00:04:01,029
that sits behind the drive.

77
00:04:02,270 --> 00:04:05,199
Sitting four screws so that it is screwed

78
00:04:05,389 --> 00:04:07,305
from this point.

79
00:04:07,389 --> 00:04:09,389
Then you have to put on that drive after.

80
00:04:09,880 --> 00:04:11,880
There you have the crankshaft.

81
00:04:12,339 --> 00:04:16,160
When you kick, you see then it drives.

82
00:04:17,989 --> 00:04:19,989
Then it goes all the way up.

83
00:04:20,179 --> 00:04:24,119
Now these are a bit loose and on the other side you can see.

84
00:04:24,790 --> 00:04:27,869
There we have the original house for the switches.

85
00:04:29,640 --> 00:04:31,125
So you do.

86
00:04:31,209 --> 00:04:35,970
So I have screwed the plate where the switches sit.

87
00:04:37,649 --> 00:04:39,929
But it then spins.

88
00:04:41,119 --> 00:04:42,925
Then the surface is against it.

89
00:04:43,010 --> 00:04:45,929
So from this page I look almost original.

90
00:04:46,670 --> 00:04:48,785
This is where you can see that it is a little more modern thing

91
00:04:48,869 --> 00:04:50,675
Sitting there.

92
00:04:50,760 --> 00:04:51,905
I think that does not bother.

93
00:04:51,989 --> 00:04:56,549
And then even then under the generator here where I made a plate bracket

94
00:04:57,309 --> 00:05:00,915
that has put a small rubber pillow on so that the generator is lying

95
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,519
And resting on a rubber pillow.

96
00:05:04,230 --> 00:05:05,425
A little buckle.

97
00:05:05,510 --> 00:05:08,049
That said, these engines vibrate a little neighbor

98
00:05:08,839 --> 00:05:12,299
and then sits the generator screwed with four screws at that end

99
00:05:12,619 --> 00:05:16,149
So easy that it lies and vibrates and then they go off after a while.

100
00:05:16,799 --> 00:05:20,429
But if you put such a damper rubber, it is more steady,

101
00:05:20,959 --> 00:05:22,415
Then it lasts for more miles.

102
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:26,505
Then it was the oil pump that was broken and it was the same repair on it

103
00:05:26,589 --> 00:05:29,470
As I got to do on my cousin's Sarolea.

104
00:05:30,040 --> 00:05:35,845
Here is a cylindrical piston with drive along

105
00:05:35,929 --> 00:05:37,929
So on the inside here.

106
00:05:38,649 --> 00:05:39,955
Now it is not possible here unfortunately.

107
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:42,305
But then it sits.

108
00:05:42,390 --> 00:05:46,350
It inside that drive, it sits like a screw in that direction.

109
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:52,470
That goes on these drives and then it becomes that this one starts to spin

110
00:05:53,779 --> 00:05:56,609
And then there is a screw there that goes down a track.

111
00:05:57,760 --> 00:06:02,109
That is oval in this cylinder so when it spins

112
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:04,970
Then it starts to go back and forth like this.

113
00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:09,429
And then you see in those holes it starts to pump oil.

114
00:06:09,679 --> 00:06:11,655
There is oil here.

115
00:06:16,646 --> 00:06:17,505
And so comes here.

116
00:06:17,589 --> 00:06:19,505
But I think the oil is over now.

117
00:06:19,589 --> 00:06:25,279
I've been pumping everything out now so now you can oil it too.

118
00:06:26,950 --> 00:06:30,329
So these two channels, they go in.

119
00:06:31,779 --> 00:06:33,779
In this cover.

120
00:06:34,420 --> 00:06:36,420
It's the two.

121
00:06:36,750 --> 00:06:40,549
And then a pump in oil there and lubricates.

122
00:06:41,799 --> 00:06:43,799
The entire crank party.

123
00:06:44,559 --> 00:06:46,589
The other one.

124
00:06:46,589 --> 00:06:48,950
It goes up and lubricates them here.

125
00:06:49,869 --> 00:06:51,869
It also goes up here.

126
00:06:53,119 --> 00:06:54,865
And get up to the top.

127
00:06:54,950 --> 00:06:56,950
And lubricate the lashes up here.

128
00:06:57,380 --> 00:07:00,200
So you can say that this one becomes like a double pump.

129
00:07:01,380 --> 00:07:05,619
One manages the crankshaft, one manages the drive and the top

130
00:07:06,299 --> 00:07:09,579
and then it's the same thing it was on my cousins

131
00:07:10,309 --> 00:07:15,380
That when you have oil pressure you see that this little stick here.

132
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
It is spring loaded.

133
00:07:18,799 --> 00:07:19,785
Then he goes up.

134
00:07:19,869 --> 00:07:21,775
Then I go down when the pressure disappears.

135
00:07:21,859 --> 00:07:23,955
It did not go high for me without no.

136
00:07:24,040 --> 00:07:25,325
It will be to mecca first.

137
00:07:25,410 --> 00:07:28,279
Yes but you knew that.
 Yes.

138
00:07:29,640 --> 00:07:33,450
I would like to go through too so I know it really works.

139
00:07:34,250 --> 00:07:40,095
I have not decided whether to disassemble the gearbox yet.

140
00:07:40,179 --> 00:07:41,145
Should the oil anyway.

141
00:07:41,230 --> 00:07:43,055
It's something that is safe.

142
00:07:43,140 --> 00:07:47,365
And then possibly take that top lid and check out this

143
00:07:47,450 --> 00:07:49,885
So that the valves really are dense.

144
00:07:49,970 --> 00:07:53,820
But the engine has submitted to the motor renovator.

145
00:07:54,970 --> 00:07:57,989
So I think it should work.

146
00:08:00,040 --> 00:08:03,495
But when you looked when you picked this apart

147
00:08:03,579 --> 00:08:06,309
So these drives didn't sit right.

148
00:08:06,670 --> 00:08:08,670
There you see a small dot.

149
00:08:09,510 --> 00:08:11,510
And then there is a dot there.

150
00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:13,205
They should be in the middle of each other.

151
00:08:13,290 --> 00:08:15,215
Similarly here.

152
00:08:15,299 --> 00:08:18,600
Find a dot and a dot on it and likewise down here.

153
00:08:20,070 --> 00:08:21,875
Most importantly, it is.

154
00:08:21,959 --> 00:08:23,670
Here is Kam the drive.

155
00:08:24,520 --> 00:08:29,505
It is very important that it sits right because it sits a dot on the instance dot

156
00:08:29,589 --> 00:08:32,986
On this drive and it was not true that I got it started.

157
00:08:33,070 --> 00:08:37,756
It was absolutely incredible for that drive where they turned

158
00:08:37,840 --> 00:08:39,496
out and in so it was not possible to see any dots

159
00:08:39,580 --> 00:08:41,580
At all on it.

160
00:08:44,049 --> 00:08:49,510
Then they have missed the oil pump that it was so worn.

161
00:08:50,869 --> 00:08:52,416
We'll see.

162
00:08:52,500 --> 00:08:54,316
I will give him a chance to start up he

163
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:56,276
And see look for noise.

164
00:08:56,359 --> 00:08:57,116
Then I hear something.

165
00:08:57,200 --> 00:09:01,159
Every now and then we stop down and then we look it up.

166
00:09:01,650 --> 00:09:03,205
Then it's equal to the wheels

167
00:09:04,690 --> 00:09:06,690
Have known a little on the brakes.

168
00:09:07,390 --> 00:09:09,419
When running with the handbrake and spinning on the wheel

169
00:09:09,549 --> 00:09:14,289
So it chops like this and it will be because the spokes.

170
00:09:16,270 --> 00:09:18,619
Is attached directly to the brake drum here.

171
00:09:20,359 --> 00:09:22,346
They sit here in the brake drum.

172
00:09:22,429 --> 00:09:23,866
It sits in the oaks here.

173
00:09:23,950 --> 00:09:29,020
Then it is very important that you have the same tension in all the oaks.

174
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:32,770
For you have two oaks that are too much drawn.

175
00:09:33,419 --> 00:09:38,126
Then the hole in here becomes oval and then it becomes that it chops like this

176
00:09:38,210 --> 00:09:39,936
When it slows down the handbrake.

177
00:09:40,020 --> 00:09:42,650
Sometimes you can actually hear.

178
00:09:48,359 --> 00:09:50,710
It is tense and it is slack.

179
00:09:51,700 --> 00:09:53,156
You hear that on the key.

180
00:09:53,239 --> 00:09:56,809
The higher the tone the tensioners are.

181
00:09:57,520 --> 00:09:59,466
So it is low.

182
00:09:59,549 --> 00:10:01,549
It's not tense.

183
00:10:03,030 --> 00:10:05,030
There you have a very.

184
00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:10,619
I am a deaf, so it would have been worthless to me.

185
00:10:12,750 --> 00:10:14,760
The rear wheel is not so dangerous.

186
00:10:16,289 --> 00:10:18,166
There you can live with if it chops a little neighbor,

187
00:10:18,250 --> 00:10:22,156
But the front wheel is quite unpleasant if you need to brake hard

188
00:10:22,239 --> 00:10:24,479
And it starts to giggle like this.

189
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:28,746
So you have to fix that.

190
00:10:28,830 --> 00:10:31,900
I have ripped a whole electrical system, all the cables and this.

191
00:10:32,309 --> 00:10:35,130
It's not good MC cables because they are.

192
00:10:36,169 --> 00:10:41,676
If you look at these, there are very few threads so such a cable

193
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:43,760
becomes very stiff.

194
00:10:44,150 --> 00:10:47,440
The stiffer the cable you have the easier it goes by vibration.

195
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:51,700
This is how you want a cable that has a lot of threads

196
00:10:52,030 --> 00:10:54,030
which becomes soft and compliant.

197
00:10:54,580 --> 00:10:56,645
Then he can lie down and vibrate without such a thing.

198
00:10:56,729 --> 00:10:59,066
The engine vibrates very much so then it is important

199
00:10:59,150 --> 00:11:01,150
That you have the right cabling.

200
00:11:02,780 --> 00:11:05,280
And it is also an advantage when you have 12 volts.

201
00:11:05,369 --> 00:11:09,289
Then you do not need to have such coarse cables, but then you can go down to dimension.

202
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:13,756
If we say it was three square millimeters in six volts

203
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:16,340
So you can go down to one and a half when we drive twelve.

204
00:11:17,429 --> 00:11:20,020
Then it is easier to get hold of soft cables.

205
00:11:21,880 --> 00:11:23,116
It is removed.

206
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:25,200
There are some left that I will remove.

207
00:11:25,690 --> 00:11:28,409
I have been able to buy a larger battery that is twelve volts

208
00:11:28,590 --> 00:11:32,710
But it is the same height as six volts so it fits almost directly.

209
00:11:33,869 --> 00:11:36,010
Here and there you see no major difference.

210
00:11:36,549 --> 00:11:39,820
I took 6 volts, the battery was so big.

211
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:43,286
The miss does not adorn.

212
00:11:43,369 --> 00:11:46,830
I get to rebuild the lantern here with the reflector.

213
00:11:47,450 --> 00:11:53,515
But i have looked a little bit and i think probably curse me

214
00:11:53,599 --> 00:11:59,520
that one can use lantern from a golf for it has about the same size

215
00:12:00,640 --> 00:12:04,366
And then I can also have H4 lamp for here sits a holder

216
00:12:04,450 --> 00:12:06,760
for a 6 volt lamp.

217
00:12:07,260 --> 00:12:10,520
No, but that I think can work.

218
00:12:11,190 --> 00:12:13,799
Then it is an advantage to get that name Lucas,

219
00:12:14,700 --> 00:12:16,356
He who invented the darkness.

220
00:12:16,440 --> 00:12:18,440
Maybe a little nicer if it says Bosch.

221
00:12:20,289 --> 00:12:22,359
Now I get Verrenda Englishman after me.

222
00:12:22,450 --> 00:12:27,506
You get every single one who drives English car by the type I drive English car.

223
00:12:27,590 --> 00:12:30,746
There are quite a few who love English cars here in town

224
00:12:30,830 --> 00:12:34,416
So I have to look back most when I move forward.

225
00:12:37,157 --> 00:12:38,380
It will probably be alright.

226
00:12:38,380 --> 00:12:41,840
We continue on it, then we have to check when we start it.

227
00:12:42,960 --> 00:12:45,257
I look in here when it's time.

228
00:12:47,124 --> 00:12:47,756
Yes, we say so long.

229
00:12:47,840 --> 00:12:49,150
We'll do that.
