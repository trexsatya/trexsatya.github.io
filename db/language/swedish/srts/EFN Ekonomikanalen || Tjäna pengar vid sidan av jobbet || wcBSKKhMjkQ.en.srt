00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.600
Welcome to Finance Aid.
 Today, the theme is alternative income.

2
00:00:05.680 --> 00:00:11.040
How can you make money on other than your usual, honest job

3
00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:14.720
Mickan, what have you had for alternative income in your days

4
00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:18.080
I haven't had that much like that.

5
00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:21.680
I have had many extra jobs.

6
00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:27.120
What we are going to focus on today is the type of earnings you can do

7
00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:32.440
Which, after a while, does not require your time.
 Or how do you think?

8
00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:35.680
Alternative incomes

9
00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:38.560
Yes.
 It is not from a regular job

10
00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:43.760
And cannot be supplemented with the regular job.

11
00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:52.960
We have a deep dive into the subject and you get the urge to try on one than the other.

12
00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:58.160
I have friends who have participated in studies

13
00:00:58.240 --> 00:01:02.240
For medicines and diet.

14
00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:07.280
We found one where you can test sprouts for seven days.

15
00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:09.840
It seems a little exciting.

16
00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:15.200
Test sprouts for a week and get 1000 bucks.

17
00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:17.720
You get to look out.

18
00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:22.840
We have received some input on social media.
 A tip about

19
00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:28.320
that one could rebuild a garage or a room and rent out-

20
00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:33.920
And get some extra slants.
 We will talk about rental income later.

21
00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:39.240
But it was a great tip.
 Please continue to come up with tips and input.

22
00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:46.680
Write to EFN's Instagram, Youtube comments field or live on Facebook.

23
00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:51.160
You choose for yourself.
 You can see the address at the bottom of the screen.

24
00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:55.760
Keep in touch.
 Continue to come up with questions, input and concerns.

25
00:01:55.840 --> 00:02:01.520
Initially we can say that generally if one counts together

26
00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:07.160
All different types of income you have, you need to declare all.

27
00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:10.760
Even if you participate in a panel, do a survey online

28
00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:16.440
Or make money selling your art or other hobby business.

29
00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:20.440
If there are over 20,000, it must be declared.

30
00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:23.040
We want to point that.

31
00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:27.560
Even if you have calculated that it should be tax -free ...

32
00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:31.840
... maybe you have to declare it anyway.
 -Remember that.

33
00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:39.880
An alternative income that both you and I and many are already looking at

34
00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:46.640
To invest in shares and funds so that you get a return.

35
00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:53.680
You are a very good supporter.
 You have a football team that you cheer for.

36
00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:58.000
You might be able to rent out football supporters.

37
00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:01.000
You set up and cheer for other teams.

38
00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:03.920
You do not sell your soul.

39
00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:10.880
We have with us a guest Marcus Lindblad-

40
00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:13.640
which is a cheer on alternative incomes.

41
00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:19.200
Savings profile, blogger, affiliate artist and much more.
 Welcome

42
00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:21.200
Thanks so much.

43
00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:29.240
Marcus, as you write a lot about alternative income and economy

44
00:03:29.320 --> 00:03:33.680
You have tried alternative income sources and received input on social media-

45
00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:37.480
Which do you think stands out as pretty ...

46
00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:40.960
Alternative income is both high and low.

47
00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:43.480
Some give two kronor per hour and others a little more.

48
00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:46.560
Which stands out as the better

49
00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:50.560
It's a bit individual.

50
00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:56.120
Mikaela, you mentioned to be creative.

51
00:03:56.200 --> 00:03:59.320
It is about what you are good at.

52
00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:03.800
You test a little different things.
 What you think is fun

53
00:04:03.880 --> 00:04:08.040
And is good at.
 That is what suits one.

54
00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:14.080
How do you find out what you are good at does everyone have that self -insight?

55
00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:16.880
That is a good question.

56
00:04:16.960 --> 00:04:21.400
It is such a question that has taken me where I am today.

57
00:04:21.480 --> 00:04:26.040
You have wanted to hunt around a bit and test a little different things.

58
00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:33.200
Everything from ordering cans to selling things in flea or markets.

59
00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:37.400
It got me into investment.

60
00:04:37.480 --> 00:04:45.160
If you top the best.
 That's what you are best at.

61
00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:51.560
It is a good starting point.
 Are there any that are at the bottom of the list

62
00:04:51.640 --> 00:04:54.920
Worst, you say?
 -Yes.

63
00:04:55.880 --> 00:05:01.280
It is about how to value your time.

64
00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:10.200
Panel surveys I would not spend time on, many may start there.

65
00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:18.160
In the case of panel surveys it is easy to register

66
00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:20.800
And easy to get investigations started.

67
00:05:20.880 --> 00:05:28.400
But the followers write that there will be no many kronor in hourly salary.

68
00:05:28.480 --> 00:05:33.480
Just.
 We got some reply on instagram about

69
00:05:33.560 --> 00:05:37.040
That they got some cinema ticket or hundred dollars.

70
00:05:37.120 --> 00:05:40.200
Pretty many of those services may also have a roof

71
00:05:40.280 --> 00:05:42.760
A minimum to get the money out.

72
00:05:42.840 --> 00:05:46.200
But it is good to bring with you

73
00:05:46.280 --> 00:05:51.720
that if you feed on with any alternative income that does not pay so well-

74
00:05:51.800 --> 00:05:57.040
Could it be better to work extra on your regular job.

75
00:05:57.120 --> 00:06:00.200
Yes, there you have a good point.

76
00:06:00.280 --> 00:06:03.920
Ask the neighbor if you can mow the lawn.

77
00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:06.640
It depends on what you are looking for.

78
00:06:06.720 --> 00:06:09.720
You are also good at affiliate.

79
00:06:09.800 --> 00:06:15.760
Do you have any tips to send to anyone who is looking to try.

80
00:06:15.840 --> 00:06:20.040
Affiliate marketing is something I live on.

81
00:06:20.120 --> 00:06:26.200
There are many in Sweden who do not know

82
00:06:26.280 --> 00:06:29.320
But as they might be able to apply.

83
00:06:29.400 --> 00:06:38.040
You may be part of a home driving service for food.

84
00:06:38.120 --> 00:06:43.880
You invite your friend and get 50: in discount on your next order.

85
00:06:43.960 --> 00:06:50.320
I use it to make money for my business.

86
00:06:50.400 --> 00:06:55.920
Then you can create different types of content, videos and the like.

87
00:06:56.000 --> 00:07:00.560
Then there are advertising links linked to it.

88
00:07:00.640 --> 00:07:03.360
When people press them you get paid.

89
00:07:03.440 --> 00:07:08.360
Just.
 Then you can become an expert on a particular subject.

90
00:07:08.440 --> 00:07:11.760
It is important to create value.

91
00:07:11.840 --> 00:07:16.280
This is what makes followers and readers want to use the links

92
00:07:16.360 --> 00:07:20.360
So that you make money on them.

93
00:07:20.440 --> 00:07:25.200
Create content that gives something to those who watch is the key

94
00:07:25.280 --> 00:07:28.760
to become a good affiliate platform.

95
00:07:28.840 --> 00:07:31.960
One last question on the affiliate theme:

96
00:07:32.040 --> 00:07:37.840
Do you become worried about brands and which you advertise ...

97
00:07:37.920 --> 00:07:42.960
Are you trying to sell if there are any that feel doubtful

98
00:07:43.040 --> 00:07:45.720
How to make that balancing

99
00:07:45.800 --> 00:07:49.440
It is a very important issue.

100
00:07:49.520 --> 00:07:52.360
It is important to test the service yourself.

101
00:07:52.440 --> 00:07:58.480
Is there something I can stand for and send out to my followers

102
00:07:58.560 --> 00:08:03.360
There, as a viewer and followers, you usually feel in case

103
00:08:03.440 --> 00:08:07.840
The producer of the content has actually tested it himself.

104
00:08:07.920 --> 00:08:12.360
Do you have source criticism and analyzed the content

105
00:08:12.440 --> 00:08:18.600
Thank you so much, Marcus.
 Good tips you shared.

106
00:08:18.680 --> 00:08:23.160
Thanks for being able to join.
 -Bye!

107
00:08:24.240 --> 00:08:27.480
Start with what you are good at.

108
00:08:27.560 --> 00:08:31.360
It is a good theme for all alternative incomes.

109
00:08:31.440 --> 00:08:34.560
What can I make money on the basis of my talents

110
00:08:34.640 --> 00:08:37.440
What are people interested in this is about access and demand.

111
00:08:37.520 --> 00:08:41.400
If you are good at something that everyone is good at, it is more difficult to pay.

112
00:08:41.480 --> 00:08:46.000
If you are half good on something that stands out, you can be a little creative about it.

113
00:08:46.080 --> 00:08:49.240
That you create that space and dare to take out the turns.

114
00:08:49.320 --> 00:08:54.280
It is also about finding opportunities with what you have.

115
00:08:54.360 --> 00:08:58.960
Many rent out properties of various kinds.

116
00:08:59.040 --> 00:09:03.360
We have a deep dive in what applies.

117
00:09:03.440 --> 00:09:06.800
I have basic dive anyway.

118
00:09:06.880 --> 00:09:11.280
It can be good to carry with you.
 It's pretty pretty

119
00:09:11.360 --> 00:09:18.280
Very favorable tax rules for renting out a room, home or house.

120
00:09:18.360 --> 00:09:24.360
You can rent for up to SEK 40,000 tax -free.

121
00:09:24.440 --> 00:09:27.920
You may also make a deduction of 20 % of the rental income.

122
00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:32.200
In practice, you can rent out for 50,000 a year tax -free.

123
00:09:32.280 --> 00:09:34.880
It is still quite a lot.

124
00:09:34.960 --> 00:09:39.920
This applies if you have a smaller house on the site

125
00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:42.960
Or if you have an apartment.

126
00:09:43.040 --> 00:09:48.240
When it comes to renting out a condominium ...

127
00:09:48.320 --> 00:09:53.840
For houses it is different.
 You own it and do not need to apply to rent.

128
00:09:53.920 --> 00:10:01.360
But when it comes to an apartment, I have asked the rental committee about this.

129
00:10:01.440 --> 00:10:07.880
You can rent out for up to three years without the rental committee saying no

130
00:10:07.960 --> 00:10:12.280
to a tenant -owner association.
 There may be reason why they say no.

131
00:10:12.360 --> 00:10:15.560
But in general, they don't usually do it.

132
00:10:15.640 --> 00:10:18.160
It usually lasts for one year at a time.

133
00:10:18.240 --> 00:10:22.120
But it is always good to check with its tenant association.

134
00:10:22.200 --> 00:10:27.600
That is what is good to know about renting out your home.

135
00:10:27.680 --> 00:10:32.080
These are quite clear and nice conditions in any case up to 50,000.

136
00:10:32.160 --> 00:10:36.760
After 50,000, there is 30 % tax on rental income.

137
00:10:36.840 --> 00:10:40.080
What can one more do to make money

138
00:10:40.160 --> 00:10:42.400
We talked a little about surveys.

139
00:10:42.480 --> 00:10:48.680
There are a lot of different sites.
 Google on "survey".

140
00:10:48.760 --> 00:10:51.000
But it sounded like ... -time -demanding.

141
00:10:51.080 --> 00:10:53.240
You have to weigh the positive towards the negative.

142
00:10:53.320 --> 00:10:58.520
It takes some time, but it is flexible.
 You can do it anywhere in the world.

143
00:10:58.600 --> 00:11:04.960
At the same time, you may be able to find alternatives through freelance finance or so.

144
00:11:05.040 --> 00:11:11.920
You can try to get the fee.
 You have to compare what you actually get.

145
00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:14.920
You can start a pod.
 -We have done that.

146
00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:17.040
It is the EFN Finance Aid.

147
00:11:17.120 --> 00:11:22.680
However, we have no "affiliate" collaborations on it.

148
00:11:22.760 --> 00:11:25.960
No.
 -It's editorial content.

149
00:11:26.040 --> 00:11:31.200
It may be good to know that you now find finance aid as a pod version.

150
00:11:31.280 --> 00:11:36.240
It's new for this season, and it's fun.

151
00:11:36.320 --> 00:11:41.360
One can also, as many of you who follow us, invest

152
00:11:41.440 --> 00:11:47.320
And take part in value growth in that way.

153
00:11:47.400 --> 00:11:52.000
We will not dive into it, but ...

154
00:11:52.080 --> 00:11:55.800
Dividends are below that category.

155
00:11:55.880 --> 00:12:02.200
We have made sections on how to think when investing in shares and funds.

156
00:12:02.280 --> 00:12:05.560
In Youtube flow I see that Elin has written:

157
00:12:05.640 --> 00:12:11.840
"Maybe a credit card with cashback can be counted as alternative income"

158
00:12:11.920 --> 00:12:15.000
Yes, I think so.
 -Yes actually.

159
00:12:15.080 --> 00:12:19.600
I saw a documentary about a person living on it.

160
00:12:19.680 --> 00:12:24.360
Does he live on it?
 -Yes.
 Don't ask me how it goes together.

161
00:12:24.440 --> 00:12:27.520
I didn't look so carefully at that section.

162
00:12:27.600 --> 00:12:33.280
But it was a documentary on the theme of personal finance.

163
00:12:33.360 --> 00:12:36.880
Fun.
 Loppis, then can you make money from it?

164
00:12:36.960 --> 00:12:41.640
Yes, you can earn up to 50,000 on flea ice cream.

165
00:12:41.720 --> 00:12:46.920
Without tax?
 -No, it must be declared.

166
00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:54.240
It is definitely an extra income.

167
00:12:54.320 --> 00:12:58.920
How much do you need to sell for 50,000?
 -Is the 50,000 limit?

168
00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:03.640
Under 50,000 there is no tax.
 But you have to declare

169
00:13:03.720 --> 00:13:07.640
If it is over 50,000, it is counted as income from business activities.

170
00:13:07.720 --> 00:13:10.800
You can also pick berries, mushrooms and cones.

171
00:13:10.880 --> 00:13:15.480
It's a little special.
 I wonder why it has been picked out.

172
00:13:15.560 --> 00:13:20.320
You thought it was a tradition here.
 -Yes, it was a guess.

173
00:13:20.400 --> 00:13:26.320
You can pick cones.
 You can sell them in the inner city at Christmas.

174
00:13:26.400 --> 00:13:29.640
In Stockholm, Gothenburg or where you live.

175
00:13:29.720 --> 00:13:33.520
There you get better paid than if you are in someone's forest.

176
00:13:33.600 --> 00:13:35.600
It's like selling sand in the desert.

177
00:13:35.680 --> 00:13:40.600
You can earn SEK 12,500, tax -free.

178
00:13:40.680 --> 00:13:45.320
That's a tip.
 But it takes time to pick.

179
00:13:45.400 --> 00:13:50.320
I would focus on cloudberries.
 It is the best margin on it

180
00:13:50.400 --> 00:13:53.160
Yes, cloudberries and blueberries, I tip.

181
00:13:53.240 --> 00:13:57.560
It's probably pretty good.
 The deer is probably the most expensive.

182
00:13:57.640 --> 00:14:03.960
I think we ... I've started here.
 I thought we would rate

183
00:14:04.040 --> 00:14:10.720
Based on our spontaneous feeling, slightly different types of alternative income.

184
00:14:10.800 --> 00:14:18.040
It is about how exciting they feel and how lucrative we feel they are.

185
00:14:18.120 --> 00:14:23.080
It will be a summary rating.
 We'll have a look at this.

186
00:14:23.160 --> 00:14:26.480
You can start and take the press.

187
00:14:26.560 --> 00:14:30.000
To respond to surveys, the first?
 -Yes, on scale 1-5.

188
00:14:30.080 --> 00:14:33.080
My time is the most important thing I have.

189
00:14:33.160 --> 00:14:37.960
I don't like to sit in front of a computer, so it will be a star for me.

190
00:14:38.040 --> 00:14:43.760
I put 2. or a money bag.

191
00:14:43.840 --> 00:14:49.080
It seems easy to get started and get surveys to answer.

192
00:14:49.160 --> 00:14:51.560
But the hourly wage seems to be like that

193
00:14:51.640 --> 00:14:56.400
Judging from the input we have received from our readers and followers.

194
00:14:56.480 --> 00:15:01.720
I tried myself.
 It was difficult to get up in a reasonable compensation in time.

195
00:15:01.800 --> 00:15:06.280
You filled in half the form and never got the cinema ticket.
 You gave up.

196
00:15:06.360 --> 00:15:09.640
That's why I got nothing.
 It was so simple.

197
00:15:09.720 --> 00:15:14.240
"Multilevel Marketing" is in some cases ...

198
00:15:14.320 --> 00:15:21.120
It is in a gray zone and can in some cases be considered pyramid scheme.

199
00:15:21.200 --> 00:15:23.240
It's a little sensitive.

200
00:15:23.320 --> 00:15:29.320
I am very little familiar with this, but it will be a money bag.

201
00:15:29.400 --> 00:15:36.240
I am afraid that people will be exploited and do not like that feeling.

202
00:15:36.320 --> 00:15:43.280
I also put a 1st on it, for ... -or 2.

203
00:15:43.360 --> 00:15:48.760
I sneak in a 2nd.
 No.
 On the one hand, you often need to buy different starting packages.

204
00:15:48.840 --> 00:15:54.920
Then you have to invest money.
 Then it is difficult to discern which ones are serious.

205
00:15:55.000 --> 00:16:00.640
Some are of the more serious kind and some are of the rogue kind.

206
00:16:00.720 --> 00:16:03.680
It is not always easy to discern.

207
00:16:03.760 --> 00:16:09.920
You can do surveys, google and take references and so on.

208
00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:13.920
References are difficult, because there is probably someone who makes money.

209
00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:18.720
When recruiting, they make money.
 They have incentives to say it's good.

210
00:16:18.800 --> 00:16:24.600
Good.
 Rent out gadgets.
 -It's great if you have the opportunity.

211
00:16:24.680 --> 00:16:31.880
One might be renting out a boat or a caravan

212
00:16:31.960 --> 00:16:36.240
for a holiday week.
 Super nice.

213
00:16:36.320 --> 00:16:38.800
What will it be

214
00:16:38.880 --> 00:16:44.920
3, 4… 4. -I sets a 4.

215
00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:48.400
I said 4. -Then we are two 4s.

216
00:16:48.480 --> 00:16:55.720
Fun.
 You can rent your drill to the neighbor or such things.

217
00:16:55.800 --> 00:17:02.200
It feels sustainability that things are used and you do not have to buy new.

218
00:17:02.280 --> 00:17:07.920
Renting the drill to the neighbor does not take that much time.

219
00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:12.400
You make money while the drill is used.
 You don't have to do anything.

220
00:17:12.480 --> 00:17:14.920
It feels really promising.

221
00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:20.520
It is often possible to get help from different sites and services

222
00:17:20.600 --> 00:17:26.240
to rent out their gadgets, car or similar.

223
00:17:26.320 --> 00:17:30.080
You may even get help to fix insurance.

224
00:17:30.160 --> 00:17:34.280
It is important to secure it.

225
00:17:34.360 --> 00:17:37.160
Affiliates.

226
00:17:37.240 --> 00:17:44.000
Those who make really good content also get a lot of traffic

227
00:17:44.080 --> 00:17:46.400
And make good money.

228
00:17:46.480 --> 00:17:48.920
There is a correlation there.

229
00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:52.200
There is also a risk of being deceived.

230
00:17:52.280 --> 00:17:59.120
If a person is good at searching their site and so on.

231
00:18:02.200 --> 00:18:06.080
It takes a lot of time to update.
 Say 3.

232
00:18:06.160 --> 00:18:10.400
Oh it became a 4th.
 It likes to put the same as last.

233
00:18:10.480 --> 00:18:12.600
I also set a 3rd.

234
00:18:12.680 --> 00:18:16.840
Are you very good at search engine optimization and rank up your site

235
00:18:16.920 --> 00:18:21.480
And if it gets scalable, then you can make a lot of money.

236
00:18:21.560 --> 00:18:28.080
You can spend some time on static content, different types of leaderboards or guides

237
00:18:28.160 --> 00:18:32.560
Which does not need to be updated so often.
 However, there is fierce competition.

238
00:18:32.640 --> 00:18:38.000
Because there is a lot of money to be made if you are good

239
00:18:38.080 --> 00:18:41.120
Has it attracted many talented.

240
00:18:41.200 --> 00:18:47.200
Selling cones, then?
 -It's fun and nice.

241
00:18:47.280 --> 00:18:52.480
It is quick to fill a bucket.
 Sell it expensive in Stockholm's inner city.

242
00:18:52.560 --> 00:18:58.920
Forward Christmas.
 Post a shock.
 We say 3.

243
00:18:59.000 --> 00:19:07.120
It is designed to get back pain.
 I set a 1st p.g.a.
 My sore back.

244
00:19:08.240 --> 00:19:13.320
After the race this weekend.
 -Exactly.
 It was already bad.

245
00:19:13.400 --> 00:19:19.400
Good.
 Then we have rated different types of alternative income.

246
00:19:20.680 --> 00:19:23.920
Question: "Do you rent things out through an app service or entirely yourself"

247
00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:30.800
I have not tried to rent things out, but I would have liked to use a service.

248
00:19:30.880 --> 00:19:34.520
On the one hand, the payment is right.

249
00:19:34.600 --> 00:19:39.360
On the one hand, they help with different types of insurance.

250
00:19:39.440 --> 00:19:44.440
You can easily reach the right target group.
 If you are going to rent out your apartment

251
00:19:44.520 --> 00:19:49.800
There are platforms for people looking for apartment.

252
00:19:49.880 --> 00:19:51.960
It is also an advantage.

253
00:19:52.040 --> 00:19:56.600
One thing we should lift is to write a book.

254
00:19:56.680 --> 00:20:00.680
If you initially spend some time writing and creating content

255
00:20:00.760 --> 00:20:09.480
Can you make money for a long time and build a brand around the subject.

256
00:20:09.560 --> 00:20:11.800
Nice

257
00:20:11.880 --> 00:20:14.720
Finance Aid is over for this week.

258
00:20:14.800 --> 00:20:18.320
We're back next week on Monday.

259
00:20:18.400 --> 00:20:23.160
Then there will be talk about shares again.
 We will focus on pharmaceutical companies

260
00:20:23.240 --> 00:20:27.520
And the different phases for drug candidates.
 Phases 1, 2 and 3.

261
00:20:27.600 --> 00:20:31.040
It gets niche and geeky, but really fun.

262
00:20:31.120 --> 00:20:33.680
Then Ara is back.

263
00:20:33.760 --> 00:20:36.240
It is important for investors

264
00:20:36.320 --> 00:20:41.760
Since we have many listed pharmaceutical companies in Sweden.

265
00:20:41.840 --> 00:20:44.680
Check it out if you are interested in the stock exchange.

266
00:20:44.760 --> 00:20:49.360
Send questions already.
 Below in picture are all addresses

267
00:20:49.440 --> 00:20:51.880
Both for social media and e -mails.

268
00:20:51.960 --> 00:20:56.040
Feel free to share this if you think it was good.
 Tip your friends.

269
00:20:56.120 --> 00:21:03.280
Don't forget that we are as a pod version where podds are located.

270
00:21:03.360 --> 00:21:07.000
Have a nice week.
 Thanks, Mickan.
 It was nice.

271
00:21:07.080 --> 00:21:09.360
Take care.
 -Bye!
