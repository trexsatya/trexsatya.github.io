1
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:12,680
As a tactical UAV pilot, I see qualities as accuracy, responsible and even curious.

2
00:00:12,680 --> 00:00:17,000
We have a very unique expertise in the Armed Forces.

3
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:21,040
A competence that will be relevant for many years to come.

4
00:00:21,800 --> 00:00:25,800
My name is Johan and I am a tactical UAV pilot in the Armed Forces.

5
00:00:26,360 --> 00:00:32,960
If we start from a flight training period, then the day begins with a weather brief.

6
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:39,000
The flight service manager goes through today's passport and then you go down to the place to fly from -

7
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:47,320
-And carry out all Pre-Flight checks and really makes the flight system ready to fly.

8
00:00:47,320 --> 00:00:53,760
For me, it is interesting and evolving when I get to solve sharp tasks.

9
00:00:53,760 --> 00:01:02,240
It can be anything from obtaining intelligence as well as the exercise of fire management with sharp ammunition.

10
00:01:02,920 --> 00:01:07,960
I like to join and work with the current system.

11
00:01:07,960 --> 00:01:14,680
What I also like is to be able to participate and drive the development forward in terms of future systems.

12
00:01:14,680 --> 00:01:19,520
As for the development of UAVs in the Armed Forces in its entirety.

13
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:25,840
I am proud to have been given the responsibility to be a representative of the Armed Forces.
