1
00:00:07,420 --> 00:00:09,240
Oh, damn!

2
00:00:09,540 --> 00:00:12,880
Now you got something fun on film.
 Do you see where it is sitting?

3
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:14,320
Hahaha!

4
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:30,660
-Hey!
 Hello.

5
00:00:30,660 --> 00:00:32,460
-Douglas.
 Viktor.

6
00:00:32,460 --> 00:00:35,400
-How's it going?
 Well it feels good.

7
00:00:35,400 --> 00:00:37,580
-You have something odd to show?

8
00:00:37,580 --> 00:00:40,600
Well, it's a regular Subaru.

9
00:00:40,600 --> 00:00:42,400
-An ordinary Subaru?

10
00:00:42,400 --> 00:00:46,580
-What is this?
 It is a Subaru Outback from 1999.

11
00:00:46,580 --> 00:00:48,080
-Okay..

12
00:00:48,080 --> 00:00:50,620
With a 2.5 liter engine.

13
00:00:50,620 --> 00:00:54,520
-It looks a little worn.
 Yes it is getting old.

14
00:00:54,520 --> 00:00:56,500
-What is special about this car?

15
00:00:56,500 --> 00:00:58,980
It has rolled 100,000 miles and a little more.

16
00:00:58,980 --> 00:01:00,260
-Va!?
 Right.

17
00:01:00,260 --> 00:01:02,280
-100,000 miles!?
 JajemÃ¤n.

18
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:04,780
It's like new.

19
00:01:04,780 --> 00:01:06,720
After all, the meter starts again.

20
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:09,260
-The really has it rolled 100,000 miles?

21
00:01:09,260 --> 00:01:11,180
Yes, and even tasted a moose.

22
00:01:11,180 --> 00:01:12,460
-And crashed with a moose!

23
00:01:12,460 --> 00:01:17,300
-I would just ask what is special about this car and now I got the answer.

24
00:01:17,300 --> 00:01:20,060
-Here you see, has the moose taken in here?

25
00:01:20,060 --> 00:01:25,760
Exactly, the front and head slid over the bonnet and then up the roof.

26
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:29,300
The moose pushed down the roof here.

27
00:01:29,300 --> 00:01:33,260
I pressed the roof again and tried to make the best of the situation.

28
00:01:33,260 --> 00:01:35,000
Also changed box.

29
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:38,120
-Ny box and adjust the roof was the only error?

30
00:01:38,120 --> 00:01:42,740
Well, then the moose spun around and slid off the roof.

31
00:01:42,740 --> 00:01:45,040
And flew in the back of the car.

32
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:48,260
It knocked out both boxes at the back.

33
00:01:48,260 --> 00:01:51,920
And destroyed the C-pillar.

34
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:54,740
-How did it go with you?
 Not a scratch.

35
00:01:54,740 --> 00:01:57,615
Not even glass splits.

36
00:01:57,620 --> 00:02:00,960
-Why do you buy a car that has rolled 100,000 miles?

37
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:02,240
It's fun.

38
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:05,500
It had not rolled 100,000 miles when I bought it.

39
00:02:05,500 --> 00:02:08,680
It had only rolled 94,000 miles when I bought it.

40
00:02:08,680 --> 00:02:10,660
Yes only 94,000 miles ..

41
00:02:10,660 --> 00:02:12,300
Well ...

42
00:02:12,300 --> 00:02:16,820
It would have been fun to drive it to 100,000 miles.

43
00:02:16,820 --> 00:02:20,860
-How is it to own a car that has gone so far?
 What breaks?

44
00:02:20,860 --> 00:02:24,520
Well, I have had to change the gearbox.

45
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:28,580
98,000 miles had gone before it was changed.

46
00:02:28,580 --> 00:02:33,520
Beyond that, there has not been much.
 I haven't changed brakes on it.

47
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:38,260
Just changed brake pads and changed oil was 1000 mile.

48
00:02:38,260 --> 00:02:40,940
-First owner how far did he drive?

49
00:02:40,940 --> 00:02:43,160
He drove 94,000 miles.

50
00:02:43,160 --> 00:02:46,260
-How many years?
 He did it in 6 years.

51
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:49,560
-He must have lived in the car.
 Yes, hahaha!

52
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:55,920
He commuted between Sweden and Germany to import caravans.

53
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:58,345
-How many miles there will be a year?

54
00:02:58,345 --> 00:03:03,900
15,000 miles a year huh?
 Well, it will be 15,666 miles a year ...

55
00:03:03,900 --> 00:03:05,600
Hahaha!

56
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:07,740
As I said he has lived in the car.

57
00:03:07,740 --> 00:03:10,560
-How has it managed in the varnish?

58
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:14,960
The clear lacquer has started to release a little here.

59
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:18,940
-Rust?
 There is a bit everywhere.

60
00:03:18,940 --> 00:03:22,920
-It looks okay for having rolled so far.

61
00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:28,760
The bonnet is a bit matte because it is repainted a few times.

62
00:03:28,760 --> 00:03:31,580
We can look at another fun thing.

63
00:03:31,580 --> 00:03:35,420
The fuel lid, it has been refueled quite a few times.

64
00:03:35,420 --> 00:03:40,740
Every time you pull out the handle it drops gasoline.

65
00:03:40,740 --> 00:03:44,040
The gasoline eats the color so it will be like this.

66
00:03:44,040 --> 00:03:49,340
Now you can save things down here.
 -There is no sheet metal left.

67
00:03:49,340 --> 00:03:55,700
In total if you count on inflation we have calculated ...

68
00:03:55,700 --> 00:03:59,240
... that it is refueled for SEK 1.5 million.

69
00:03:59,240 --> 00:04:02,380
-Hahaha, for real?
 Yes.

70
00:04:02,380 --> 00:04:05,540
There has been a lot of gasoline in the pipes on this.

71
00:04:05,540 --> 00:04:08,840
-Here it says, 1 million km.

72
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:13,040
The last owner liked to feel where the caravan was.

73
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:17,900
-Back he until it stopped?
 Yes then he drove out a bit and pulled on the caravan.

74
00:04:19,280 --> 00:04:23,540
-This is also a bit innovative.
 When you just put it straight on.

75
00:04:23,540 --> 00:04:25,700
Yes simple.
 -Yo real design.

76
00:04:25,700 --> 00:04:28,180
-How does it look on the inside?
 It has done really well.

77
00:04:28,180 --> 00:04:31,060
The rear seat is like new.

78
00:04:31,060 --> 00:04:34,980
No one has been sitting behind?
 No, almost no one.

79
00:04:34,980 --> 00:04:39,060
The previous owner has driven himself.

80
00:04:39,060 --> 00:04:41,940
And I have not used the back seat.

81
00:04:41,940 --> 00:04:43,820
There are no stains.

82
00:04:43,820 --> 00:04:49,380
The steering wheel has seen its best days.
 It is falling in particular.

83
00:04:49,380 --> 00:04:52,220
He has probably been left -handed he who has run it.

84
00:04:52,220 --> 00:04:56,980
-The owner does not seem to have pushed anyone either because the seat looks new.

85
00:04:56,980 --> 00:05:00,800
Exactly, it is probably me who has used that seat most.

86
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:05,820
Here it says 999,999.
 Yes the meter stayed there.

87
00:05:05,820 --> 00:05:10,660
It has gone 1000 miles but I have had to count on the trip meter.

88
00:05:10,660 --> 00:05:14,960
Every time it has turned over to 1000 km I have written it down on a note.

89
00:05:14,980 --> 00:05:17,500
-Is there any documentation on the car?

90
00:05:17,500 --> 00:05:23,420
The glove compartment can hardly be closed because it is so full.

91
00:05:23,420 --> 00:05:28,580
Here it falls out stuff.
 It is almost all inspection protocols.

92
00:05:28,580 --> 00:05:31,540
All receipts and everything done with the car.

93
00:05:31,540 --> 00:05:37,460
In recent years it has been good and only been a small fix.

94
00:05:37,460 --> 00:05:42,000
The last inspection did not go so well.

95
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:45,820
Rust in thresholds rear that is too close to bearing construction.

96
00:05:45,820 --> 00:05:49,880
And bad lanterns.

97
00:05:49,880 --> 00:05:53,160
A lamp that was loose, fog lights that were broken.

98
00:05:53,160 --> 00:05:58,980
Handbrake that took bad and the springs that were off both sides.

99
00:05:58,980 --> 00:06:01,180
-What do you have for future plans with this car?

100
00:06:01,180 --> 00:06:07,060
I'll give it to a friend who has crashed with his car.

101
00:06:07,060 --> 00:06:13,340
He drives more or less the earth.
 He has done it the Senate 1.5 year.

102
00:06:13,340 --> 00:06:19,580
Now this car becomes a good candidate to travel with instead.

103
00:06:19,580 --> 00:06:23,220
It is a little difficult to sell, hahaha!

104
00:06:23,220 --> 00:06:25,640
It is difficult to explain the story in an ad.

105
00:06:25,640 --> 00:06:29,640
-Is it time now to hand over it?
 Yes, that is.

106
00:06:29,640 --> 00:06:32,580
Now it will move down to the Netherlands.

107
00:06:32,580 --> 00:06:38,640
What has to be done before it moves?
 It should be changed cam strap and a brake pipe.

108
00:06:38,640 --> 00:06:40,900
After that he may take it.

109
00:06:40,900 --> 00:06:43,260
I liked someone here ..

110
00:06:43,500 --> 00:06:45,320
Hello!
 -Hey!

111
00:06:45,320 --> 00:06:47,760
-How are you?
 Good!

112
00:06:47,760 --> 00:06:51,500
-Douglas.
 Cow, nice to meet.

113
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:56,120
-So you are the one to take over the car?
 Yes, Viktor gave me a Subaru.

114
00:06:56,120 --> 00:06:58,540
Because I crashed mine.

115
00:06:58,540 --> 00:07:01,100
I have another Subaru that I bought in New Zealand.

116
00:07:01,100 --> 00:07:03,360
I lived in New Zealand for 3 years.

117
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:07,780
In 2014 I bought my first Subaru for 1500 euros.

118
00:07:07,780 --> 00:07:10,980
It had gone 25,000 miles.

119
00:07:10,980 --> 00:07:14,160
All other cars I have had have broken.

120
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:16,720
I spent a lot of money on fixing them.

121
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:22,480
Then I met a friend who asked if I wanted to buy his car.

122
00:07:22,480 --> 00:07:26,620
Ah, I thought it will be a car that will break.

123
00:07:26,620 --> 00:07:31,560
He said it is a good car and you can buy it for 1500 euros.

124
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:35,180
I bought it and started driving.

125
00:07:35,180 --> 00:07:38,660
I continued to drive and it went through the inspection.

126
00:07:38,660 --> 00:07:42,520
I drove over everything with the car.
 Out in the terrain among other things.

127
00:07:42,520 --> 00:07:45,000
I continued to drive without it breaking.

128
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:49,020
When I moved back to the Netherlands, I couldn't leave the car in New Zealand.

129
00:07:49,020 --> 00:07:51,600
Because it never broke.

130
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:54,860
So I sent the car in a container to the Netherlands.

131
00:07:54,860 --> 00:08:00,680
When the car arrived we drove to Switzerland, Italy and Austria.

132
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:02,040
Oh my God!

133
00:08:02,040 --> 00:08:05,780
Then I came up with the idea to put a large map on the bonnet.

134
00:08:05,780 --> 00:08:09,280
So I can show everyone where the car has been.

135
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:12,160
I started by making a stretch from Japan to New Zealand.

136
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:14,700
Then a stretch to the Netherlands.

137
00:08:14,700 --> 00:08:17,800
That's where my hobby started.

138
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:20,540
Last summer we drove to Northern Cape.

139
00:08:20,540 --> 00:08:25,260
On to Russia which was almost 1000 miles.

140
00:08:25,260 --> 00:08:27,440
And made that trip in 18 days.

141
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:30,300
Despite these trips, the car worked without any problems.

142
00:08:30,300 --> 00:08:34,880
I drove to England just to get a picture of the car with The London Eye.

143
00:08:34,920 --> 00:08:38,400
And add England to the bonnet so people see that the car has been in London.

144
00:08:38,400 --> 00:08:42,860
This year was the plan to send the car to the United States.

145
00:08:42,860 --> 00:08:45,960
And drive from Miami to New York.

146
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:48,380
By then the car had also been to the United States.

147
00:08:48,380 --> 00:08:51,420
The plan was to drive the car everywhere on the ground.

148
00:08:51,420 --> 00:08:54,120
But two months ago ...

149
00:08:54,120 --> 00:08:56,300
I drove on an icy road.

150
00:08:56,300 --> 00:08:59,980
The car started to gossip and I drove too fast.

151
00:08:59,980 --> 00:09:03,200
I drove into a tree at 80 km/h and everything broke on the car.

152
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:06,420
Even the crankshaft in the engine broke.

153
00:09:06,420 --> 00:09:09,360
There was nothing to save on the car.

154
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:13,640
I felt bad because all the plans I had were now gone.

155
00:09:13,640 --> 00:09:19,400
It was total chaos, I couldn't sleep or eat in a week.

156
00:09:19,400 --> 00:09:24,200
Viktor saw pictures of the crashed car on Facebook.

157
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:27,900
And he contacted me and I have a car for you.

158
00:09:27,900 --> 00:09:30,560
I have a 1 million km Subaru Outback.

159
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:32,760
You can get it if you want.

160
00:09:32,760 --> 00:09:35,180
So now I'm happy again.

161
00:09:35,180 --> 00:09:38,080
There is something special about this car.
 It has a wonderful story.

162
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:41,140
It will be fun to be able to travel in a car again.

163
00:09:41,140 --> 00:09:46,360
The year 2020 will drive this car all the way from the Netherlands to Japan.

164
00:09:46,680 --> 00:09:51,640
Drive the car back to the Subaru factory where it was manufactured.

165
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:55,500
I'm pretty sure we can drive all the way without any problems.

166
00:09:55,640 --> 00:09:57,660
-It will cost a fortune?

167
00:09:58,100 --> 00:10:02,840
Yes, but I hope I can find some sponsors.

168
00:10:02,840 --> 00:10:07,180
That people can help pay for gasoline.

169
00:10:07,180 --> 00:10:10,260
-What is the plan when you arrive at Japan.
 Will you drive the car home?

170
00:10:10,260 --> 00:10:12,720
If Subaru wants the car, they have to take it.

171
00:10:12,780 --> 00:10:17,120
But if they do not want it, I will bring it home.

172
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:19,640
And keep driving.

173
00:10:19,640 --> 00:10:24,020
Or I send it to the United States and drive there.

174
00:10:24,020 --> 00:10:29,720
I like to travel and especially in a car because you see everything.

175
00:10:29,860 --> 00:10:35,560
If you fly, you see nothing between A and B.

176
00:10:35,560 --> 00:10:37,540
And in a car you see everything.

177
00:10:37,540 --> 00:10:39,500
-What wonderful project!
 Yes.

178
00:10:39,500 --> 00:10:42,300
Here we stand and are freezing to death.

179
00:10:42,300 --> 00:10:45,360
It's January and he walks around with hooded sweater.

180
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:47,240
-Do you not freeze?

181
00:10:47,240 --> 00:10:48,420
No.

182
00:10:48,460 --> 00:10:53,300
Normally I have shorts on me.
 -Hahaha!

183
00:10:53,380 --> 00:10:55,980
I have that in the Netherlands.

184
00:10:55,980 --> 00:10:59,380
And people look at me and say why shorts in the middle of winter.

185
00:10:59,420 --> 00:11:04,880
That's why I have jeans on me otherwise people look so strange at me.

186
00:11:05,300 --> 00:11:07,400
-You seem to like the car.
 Absolutely, I love it.

187
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:09,880
I have big plans.

188
00:11:09,880 --> 00:11:14,540
I will foil large parts of the car.

189
00:11:14,540 --> 00:11:18,040
All stories with the car, even small details like the scratches here at the back.

190
00:11:18,040 --> 00:11:21,200
All scratches have their own history.

191
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:24,020
It should be foiled but the history of the car.

192
00:11:24,020 --> 00:11:28,180
On the bonnet I will put a new map just like the old car.

193
00:11:28,180 --> 00:11:32,180
Who will show the entire trip from the Netherlands to Japan.

194
00:11:32,180 --> 00:11:38,980
Text about the plans for this car and that we drive a Subaru with 1 million km on the meter.

195
00:11:38,980 --> 00:11:42,820
About the damage here when Viktor collided with a moose.

196
00:11:42,820 --> 00:11:46,740
The plan is to put pictures up here with text.

197
00:11:46,740 --> 00:11:52,000
Write a story about the crash.

198
00:11:52,040 --> 00:11:55,580
Here or there we foliate the tank card.

199
00:11:55,580 --> 00:11:59,400
Down here we write how much money he spent on gasoline.

200
00:11:59,400 --> 00:12:04,560
It is a wonderful story so people can read about how much he refueled for.

201
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:09,540
Many people ask how I can afford to travel around.

202
00:12:09,540 --> 00:12:14,320
It doesn't cost that much.
 Because I don't travel alone.

203
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:17,720
We share the driving and gasoline cost.

204
00:12:17,720 --> 00:12:20,260
We do not take into hotels.

205
00:12:20,260 --> 00:12:22,820
We have our own tents.

206
00:12:22,820 --> 00:12:26,280
We cook all food ourselves.

207
00:12:26,280 --> 00:12:29,780
In this way, it doesn't get that expensive.

208
00:12:29,780 --> 00:12:34,960
When I drive through Europe, it is almost only gasoline that costs.

209
00:12:34,960 --> 00:12:39,860
I buy all food in regular stores.
 Which is cooked during the evening.

210
00:12:39,860 --> 00:12:41,760
It doesn't cost that much.

211
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:45,960
It's more time you need.

212
00:12:46,520 --> 00:12:48,500
Type one month.

213
00:12:48,500 --> 00:12:52,760
The last trip I made around the Baltic Gulf took 18 days.

214
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:56,620
It takes alot of time.

215
00:12:58,040 --> 00:13:01,240
But it's not that expensive.

216
00:13:01,500 --> 00:13:03,180
-Do we see if it starts?

217
00:13:03,180 --> 00:13:06,500
-It's Saturday so it may be a little tired.

218
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,800
No problem.

219
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:13,200
-Tidag leaving this car Sweden, right?

220
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:16,360
We have a trailer we will drive it back to the Netherlands on.

221
00:13:16,360 --> 00:13:20,140
It took us 16 hours to drive here yesterday.

222
00:13:20,140 --> 00:13:24,680
It will take us 15-16 hours to drive home.

223
00:13:24,680 --> 00:13:30,900
-Is it possible for viewers to follow your travels?

224
00:13:31,240 --> 00:13:35,580
I have a website.
 Subglobe.nl

225
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:41,520
I came up with the name subglobe because I travel around the world in late Subaru.

226
00:13:41,520 --> 00:13:44,680
That's why the website is called so.

227
00:13:44,680 --> 00:13:47,860
On the Facebook page "Sunglobe - Team Legacy".

228
00:13:47,860 --> 00:13:50,360
Can you follow all trips.

229
00:13:50,400 --> 00:13:54,400
The goal is to drive to Japan.

230
00:13:54,440 --> 00:13:57,000
And show the world ..

231
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,380
... that everyone has to buy a Subaru.

232
00:13:59,380 --> 00:14:02,400
-It was very nice to meet and have a lovely trip home.

233
00:14:02,540 --> 00:14:03,760
Thanks so much.

234
00:14:04,940 --> 00:14:06,680
Bye!

235
00:14:07,220 --> 00:14:09,180
There it goes.

236
00:14:09,900 --> 00:14:12,180
The next stop will be Japan.

237
00:14:12,460 --> 00:14:16,980
-How does it feel?
 Boring but still very good.

238
00:14:16,980 --> 00:14:21,020
It will be a fun thing of this.
 And I had never done it.

239
00:14:21,020 --> 00:14:23,760
-A funny story gets even better.

240
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:27,080
Yes it will be.
 Now we see how the continuation will be.
