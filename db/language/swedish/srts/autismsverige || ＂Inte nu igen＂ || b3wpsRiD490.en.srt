1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.139
Everything started when Nang ended.

2
00:00:13.365 --> 00:00:17.461
I usually do this [breathing quickly}.

3
00:00:19.019 --> 00:00:24.024
Often it was that he could not breathe, he thought he would die.

4
00:00:24.525 --> 00:00:26.014
So he just collapsed and only

5
00:00:26.014 --> 00:00:28.028
"I can't breathe mom," he was really scared.

6
00:00:28.904 --> 00:00:34.668
I had so many thoughts in my head, so I didn't want to live anymore.

7
00:00:42.143 --> 00:00:46.280
In the four, he worked in grade three, and then grade four.

8
00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:50.570
So he ended up ahead of everyone else in the school work itself.

9
00:00:57.321 --> 00:01:00.294
So I've had many outbreaks.

10
00:01:00.294 --> 00:01:07.501
When I was less .. So it was not good.
 It was screens .. broken.

11
00:01:07.888 --> 00:01:12.506
Then when he had nang, then Nang and Timmy trained very much,

12
00:01:12.506 --> 00:01:16.644
That if someone was teased then "go away instead of attacking" and such things.

13
00:01:17.497 --> 00:01:24.618
Then we realized that when he feels he is on and getting so angry, and feels that he is losing control

14
00:01:24.755 --> 00:01:27.792
Then he will "I want to call my mom".

15
00:01:28.532 --> 00:01:35.067
When he said it was a signal, he is getting an outbreak and has no control over those outbreaks.

16
00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:39.837
But when he had to call, the phone got right away and then he had to call me.

17
00:01:40.156 --> 00:01:45.293
Then I talked to him, sometimes I could calm him down so he could continue his day

18
00:01:45.293 --> 00:01:46.967
But then Nang was with him.

19
00:01:54.137 --> 00:01:56.360
Everything was raging there

20
00:01:56.408 --> 00:02:02.842
It is many years of working and struggling and training, it is not just a week.

21
00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:07.096
He does not want to get the outbreaks, does not want to be angry, he wants to feel good simply.

22
00:02:07.221 --> 00:02:13.255
He is the best guy in the world.
 He has plenty of humor, my God ...

23
00:02:15.352 --> 00:02:17.339
... so caring.

24
00:02:31.454 --> 00:02:36.997
He is my assistant and my friend.
 He is great.

25
00:02:38.353 --> 00:02:43.034
He helps me with a lot at school and how I progressed.

26
00:02:43.034 --> 00:02:46.825
I have been approved on topics when I have Amir and stuff.

27
00:02:46.962 --> 00:02:49.661
So it is really good.

28
00:02:49.968 --> 00:02:54.000
No eruptions, nothing.
 Can sit and make ten pages math.

29
00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:56.776
Happy.
 Enjoy school ...

30
00:02:58.041 --> 00:03:01.496
And it goes so well and self -confidence is growing, no problems.

31
00:03:01.656 --> 00:03:05.097
Home knowledge is my favorite at school

32
00:03:05.655 --> 00:03:08.639
I love cooking

33
00:03:15.762 --> 00:03:21.006
“How would it be if we started training Timmy to be with other adults

34
00:03:21.314 --> 00:03:24.123
Instead of just Amir ”.

35
00:03:24.397 --> 00:03:27.104
I realized right away, that he will be taken away from him.

36
00:03:27.229 --> 00:03:29.920
I read between the lines, we have been involved in this before.

37
00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:32.369
Directly I took the handset and called the headmaster

38
00:03:32.369 --> 00:03:38.339
Then she said on the phone that they should save money and he should be terminated.

39
00:03:38.943 --> 00:03:41.578
So I just “not now again”

40
00:03:48.507 --> 00:03:51.924
Amir is the only one I feel safe with.

41
00:03:52.209 --> 00:03:54.391
I can't go to school again.

42
00:03:54.391 --> 00:03:57.632
I'm afraid to get those outbursts and everything.

43
00:03:57.901 --> 00:03:59.165
It will not work.

44
00:03:59.279 --> 00:04:02.844
He needs to have that security for schooling to work.

45
00:04:02.844 --> 00:04:04.486
It is proven.

46
00:04:04.839 --> 00:04:08.948
The only time in school it worked is when he has assistant he felt safe with.

47
00:04:08.948 --> 00:04:10.171
It's been twice.

48
00:04:10.262 --> 00:04:16.357
And I know he wants to study and work in school and get good grades and all that.

49
00:04:16.357 --> 00:04:19.478
He wants it and he is capable of it.

50
00:04:19.478 --> 00:04:22.280
He is more than capable of it.
 He is very smart.

51
00:04:29.062 --> 00:04:32.093
For them, this does not fit this with the special school,

52
00:04:32.093 --> 00:04:34.989
He should really go in regular class.

53
00:04:35.069 --> 00:04:37.267
So then they end up between the chairs.

54
00:04:44.047 --> 00:04:46.487
Then I do not go to school.

55
00:04:46.487 --> 00:04:49.344
Then I stay home well.
