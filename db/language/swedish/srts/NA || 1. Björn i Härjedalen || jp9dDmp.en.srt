1
00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:02.480
Here is the track.

2
00:00:02.640 --> 00:00:06.600
God, I get a pulse from this.
 It's stressful.

3
00:00:06.760 --> 00:00:10.520
There is no clover game anyway.
 It's one with paws.

4
00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:24.840
Now I'm in Härjedalen, in Nysätern.

5
00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:29.480
Here we will both look for a bear, and cook bear.

6
00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:44.240
Now we will release the cows.
 - Good morning!
 Good morning, rubber.

7
00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:52.440
These are our mountain cows, mountainous, which are created to walk on the mountains.

8
00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:58.200
- I thought they would storm out.
 - Come then, Svensson.
 Come, the old man.

9
00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:05.800
Here at Sonfjället's foot, Marika and the man Pekka run a livestock year -round.

10
00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:09.560
They make cheese butter and brass butter of the cows milk

11
00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:13.720
And all the animals go loose and live in harmony with nature.

12
00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:18.240
But the bear does not look here because there are kisses?

13
00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:23.000
No, he goes around.
 We look at the horses and dogs that he goes around here.

14
00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:27.200
The horses stand here and froze and want to here and seek shelter

15
00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:30.360
Because they don't like the smell of the bear.

16
00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:32.560
Yes, it's about Björn.

17
00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:36.960
Marika takes me out onto the mountain to look for the mighty animal.

18
00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:41.280
Maybe we also find something to use for cooking later.

19
00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:45.600
For the first time, I will cook a dish with bear meat as a base.

20
00:01:55.480 --> 00:01:59.400
Now we will look again a Björnide that will be up here.

21
00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:03.520
-An old?
 - Yes, an old bear idea.

22
00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:12.160
Here was certainly the entrance, and this is how the hole was in.

23
00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:14.840
So all in there they lay.

24
00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:27.000
Wow!
 Imagine that there has been a bear with two bear cubs in here.

25
00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:29.400
It's powerful.

26
00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:46.800
I have found some juniper we can have for the bear later.

27
00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:49.920
- Oh, check out here.
 --Wow!

28
00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:54.160
- In the first chanterelle place at home.
 -Is that so?
 How fun.

29
00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:59.800
- This was almost better than Björn.
 -Yes of course.

30
00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:14.920
Here is the track ... of something with paws, which have pressed the grass forward.

31
00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:18.680
Yes, there you see something big.

32
00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:23.160
God, I get a pulse from this.
 It's stressful.

33
00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:26.760
There is no clover game anyway.
 It's one with paws ...

34
00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:29.920
... that has gone up.

35
00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:47.320
Closer to Björn than that we never came, despite thoughtful scouting.

36
00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:50.680
Time to give up and go into the kitchen to cook dinner.

37
00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:55.000
Soon 14 hungry locals will come and then the food will be ready.

38
00:03:55.160 --> 00:03:59.280
I am a novice with a bear, but you have probably eaten a bear since you were little.

39
00:03:59.440 --> 00:04:02.640
Type grown up with breakfast, lunch, dinner - bear.

40
00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:06.840
No sorry.
 I have to punch holes that myth.

41
00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:09.040
Then this will be even more exciting.

42
00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:14.640
I'm super peppy.
 I have with me the chanterelles and juniper from the forest

43
00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:19.320
And I was going to use both the rice and the berries.

44
00:04:19.480 --> 00:04:24.360
I will make some form of pot -fried bear with root celery and onion

45
00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:28.200
And bake some lovely lace bowl with chanterelle butter.

46
00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:32.680
- Now we will eat bear every week.
 -I hope so.

47
00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:34.800
It'll be fun.

48
00:04:53.480 --> 00:04:56.600
We drive pretty rustic, I think.

49
00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:10.840
Then we put on the lid.

50
00:05:26.440 --> 00:05:29.400
Here we have the bear pot.

51
00:05:29.560 --> 00:05:33.520
Now it has been breaking up for five hours in the oven with some red wine.

52
00:05:33.680 --> 00:05:37.920
It is root celery, a little onion and so this fired single branch

53
00:05:38.080 --> 00:05:42.080
To get a little more depth and smoked tone on it.

54
00:05:43.320 --> 00:05:46.520
You are embarrassed to taste.

55
00:05:47.680 --> 00:05:50.800
- Do you want to taste some of the bear?
 -Yes!

56
00:05:55.040 --> 00:05:59.120
- How good?
 -Bullseye.
 God so tasty.

57
00:05:59.280 --> 00:06:03.240
Is this dessert?
 We want to hear more about it.

58
00:06:03.400 --> 00:06:07.760
I am building a bear idea.
 Now I have made a bed on spruce.

59
00:06:07.920 --> 00:06:11.560
It is spruce syrup, digestive and sliced butter.

60
00:06:11.720 --> 00:06:15.200
Then I have made a crowberry and blueberry mousse.

61
00:06:15.360 --> 00:06:18.920
Then we will put on some snow.

62
00:06:20.240 --> 00:06:24.400
Then we have some lingonberries and crows.

63
00:06:24.560 --> 00:06:28.160
- We believe that.
 - This will be a success, I think.

64
00:06:43.680 --> 00:06:46.920
Welcome, welcome!

65
00:06:49.680 --> 00:06:52.880
This is like a baptism of fire for me, I have never cooked Björn before.

66
00:06:53.040 --> 00:06:58.320
But I gave myself on a safe card, a pot -fried bear roast.

67
00:06:58.480 --> 00:07:03.680
It gets musty and very taste - like Härjedalen in a small box.

68
00:07:03.840 --> 00:07:07.080
-It sounds good!
 - Yes, delicious.

69
00:07:10.680 --> 00:07:15.960
- It was delicious.
 - Yes, really good.

70
00:07:16.120 --> 00:07:19.680
- Yes, it smells so good.
 - I take it, me.

71
00:07:23.200 --> 00:07:27.840
It actually got really good.
 Surprisingly good, I think.

72
00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:32.120
- Yes, Fyfan.
 You did well.
 -How fun.

73
00:07:35.440 --> 00:07:37.400
You are welcome.
