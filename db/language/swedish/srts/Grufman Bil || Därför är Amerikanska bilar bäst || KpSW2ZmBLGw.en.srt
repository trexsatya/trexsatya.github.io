1
00:00:00.433 --> 00:00:03.683
After all, we have talked about this with quality of different cars.

2
00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:05.200
And now I'm going to pull a little anecdote for you.

3
00:00:05.283 --> 00:00:09.066
It is so that, besides Grufman car, I also have a small side business

4
00:00:09.066 --> 00:00:11.500
called Grufman GrÃ¤v.
 We are digging.

5
00:00:11.583 --> 00:00:17.516
We have done some jobs where we have found things under the customer's old garage entrance.

6
00:00:17.666 --> 00:00:21.500
And this I think illustrates what is quality or not.

7
00:00:21.550 --> 00:00:24.516
You who drive German cars understand ...

8
00:00:24.633 --> 00:00:27.416
When you see it, you're know it.
 I mean, it's totally self -clear

9
00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:29.433
On American quality instead.

10
00:00:29.516 --> 00:00:30.350
Look here.

11
00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:34.916
Here we have perfect lacquer, those who sit in the car are happy.

12
00:00:34.983 --> 00:00:36.400
The dog is happy.

13
00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:38.633
The wheels remain, they even rotate.

14
00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:40.733
This is all that was needed on an American car.

15
00:00:40.866 --> 00:00:44.883
We have learned that American cars are of good quality.

16
00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:49.033
While German cars are of inferior quality.
