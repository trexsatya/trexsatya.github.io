1
00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:09.760
Art - or weirdness.

2
00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:17.560
Sweden's art history is part of the huge story of our country.

3
00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:21.120
We will with some impacts show art-

4
00:00:21.280 --> 00:00:25.760
- As depicts changes and creation power.

5
00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:47.520
Surely he looks satisfied, knight Bengt Jönsson Oxenstierna?

6
00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:50.520
The artist has got to the hairstyle.

7
00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:55.640
The bells hanging down the back clearly show that he is wealthy -

8
00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:58.840
–And is in fashion.

9
00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:03.840
And at the same time, all generosity and godliness signal.

10
00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:07.200
Because it is he who has paid for everything.

11
00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:12.360
He has ordered all the murals throughout the church.

12
00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:20.480
Tensta church is special, mainly because it is very well preserved.

13
00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:25.320
It is cohesive.
 From the choir to the farthest in the west-

14
00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:30.160
- There is a coherent image program created at the same time.

15
00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:35.000
It is unique in this way.
 It is important in our art history.

16
00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:44.680
We are in the choir in Tensta church just north of Uppsala.

17
00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:50.600
What did the Middle Ages look like and how did she want to see herself depicted?

18
00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:55.840
Notice the weapon with the ox boiler, his armor -

19
00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:59.040
–And the coke bells.

20
00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:11.360
You try to summarize everything that is earthly and heavenly life.

21
00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:14.960
And that's not a small task.

22
00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:20.600
From the deepest to the superficial and most easily accessible.

23
00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:25.480
Within these walls, they try to create a reality.

24
00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:33.320
Reality in the Middle Ages is about everything that is between the Bible's binders.

25
00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:38.480
You do not pull out to put in human life here.

26
00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:42.920
Even the worst species.
 Also the devil.

27
00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:49.240
Johannes Rosenrod is the artist who filled this church -

28
00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:55.640
- With the help of him who created everything, which the artist himself wrote on the wall.

29
00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:08.440
It is 1400s.
 The battle for power in Sweden waves back and forth.

30
00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:13.600
The church paintings will tell you about what is important to the people.

31
00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:30.880
In the neighboring church Täby you will find the most well -known and scattered church painter:

32
00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:36.880
Albertus Pictor.
 German, just like our artist Johannes Rosenröd– -

33
00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:42.280
- That seems to have disappeared after painting the church in Tensta.

34
00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:48.040
In this type of churches you tell from the top down.

35
00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:54.000
The most important thing at the top.
 Then the motifs become more human and more human.

36
00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:59.000
And aesthetically, it is important in Swedish art history.

37
00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:04.480
I also think it's nice.
 It is a light color scale.

38
00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:10.760
It is quite neat plant ornaments, superficial throughout the church.

39
00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:16.640
The figures are fine -tuned.
 And then it has a little peculiarity -

40
00:04:16.800 --> 00:04:22.680
- And it is that the motifs sail freely in this plant ornament.

41
00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:28.160
It has not been felt the need to tie it together with lines.

42
00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:33.480
In the rear of the church there is a comic book -like "strip" -

43
00:04:33.640 --> 00:04:37.840
- In Holy Birgitta from the cradle to the grave.

44
00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:40.920
A pretty unique suite.

45
00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:47.120
First an upside -down boat - a shipwreck that is historically coated -

46
00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:53.440
- When Birgitta's parents Ingeborg and Birger are going to a coronation in Kalmar.

47
00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:59.160
They are miraculously saved, and then Ingeborg is pregnant with Birgitta.

48
00:05:02.040 --> 00:05:06.360
Birgitta is betrothed with Ulf Gudmarsson.
 Then she is 14 years old.

49
00:05:06.520 --> 00:05:11.880
Birgitta in cot.
 She gives birth to children and gets help from two women.

50
00:05:12.040 --> 00:05:18.360
Here is Birgitta at a desk.
 Above her, she has Jesus and Mary.

51
00:05:18.520 --> 00:05:23.480
She has a pen, Stylus and a delete - so she works quickly.

52
00:05:23.640 --> 00:05:28.880
Here we see the devil trying to seduce Birgitta.

53
00:05:29.040 --> 00:05:35.200
The last picture shows how her relics are brought from Rome home to Sweden -

54
00:05:35.360 --> 00:05:38.640
- And finally to Vadstena.

55
00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:43.880
So got the citizens of the 14th century, instead of googling-

56
00:05:44.040 --> 00:05:47.440
- Holy Birgitta's life in some squares.

57
00:05:47.600 --> 00:05:53.120
And when you have looked through the entire church, you knew what was worth knowing.

58
00:05:53.280 --> 00:05:58.120
They wanted the whole world to be in the church.

59
00:05:58.280 --> 00:06:03.640
It was a matter of course, and rather a philosophical attitude -

60
00:06:03.800 --> 00:06:09.200
- That everything is covered.
 Both the evil and the good exist.

61
00:06:18.560 --> 00:06:20.560
