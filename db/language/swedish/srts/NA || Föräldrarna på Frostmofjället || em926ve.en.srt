1
00:00:51.240 --> 00:00:54.440
Unbelievable.

2
00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:59.280
Incredible.
 Incredible!

3
00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:05.880
- What is incredible?
 - Did you know how many meters of gut we have?

4
00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:13.480
Eight.
 Unlike some others, I try to get education ...

5
00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:20.320
In the past we did not have the same opportunities.
 I was needed at home in the yard.

6
00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:25.400
- In the yard?
 - Yes ... in the apartment then.

7
00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:30.680
At that time, the parents went before school.

8
00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:37.880
- And you had failed in eight subjects!
 - Who told it?

9
00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:45.320
- Farmor tells it every Christmas.
 - Then she gets to sit alone on the Christmas!

10
00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:51.480
- Hi, Lina.
 Are you coming?
 - Here we knock before we go in!

11
00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:55.760
Obvious.
 Bye daddy.

12
00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:10.640
So close to each other you don't have to go!
 The sidewalk is wide!

13
00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:18.040
Then he was here again, the little nasty.
 Lina's boyfriend.

14
00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:24.160
- Ge Marcus a chance.
 - That guy has got his chances!

15
00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:31.640
- Because he had to scrape our boat?
 - He had done a good job, so ...

16
00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:36.680
Do you get angry when Lina does not come along?

17
00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:42.920
- It's the last chance to be together.
 - Should you go to sea?

18
00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:52.080
The children are getting big.
 Then we have to sit there alone, we two.

19
00:02:54.960 --> 00:03:00.600
Do not say so!
 It takes a long time before they grow up.

20
00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:06.600
No!
 Max is fifteen years old.
 Soon it is a car and your own apartment.

21
00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:10.200
He is twelve.

22
00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:14.400
We have to spend time with our children.

23
00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:20.400
That's what we do!
 We are going to Pettersson's cottage.

24
00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:26.400
I am skeptical that Marcus is alone with rope.

25
00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:31.400
Annika and Göran can keep an eye on them.

26
00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:37.560
-Is it necessary?
 - Well than you are worried.
 Kiss.

27
00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:42.880
Only one does not appear as a police officer ...

28
00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:53.280
At
 9.00 you go on the first pass.
 Our car disappears.
 What are you doing then?

29
00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:58.600
Waiting a bit, and then checks that Lina is alone.

30
00:03:58.760 --> 00:04:02.520
This is repeated every half hour.

31
00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:07.920
22.30 we bed her down, lock and go home.

32
00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:15.360
Don't listen to him now.
 Just check that Lina is coming home well in advance.

33
00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:21.160
- Can you have dinner with them on Saturday?
 -Love to!

34
00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:28.760
We were actually going to ask if we could look after them.
 We think it's fun.

35
00:04:28.920 --> 00:04:36.640
- Gustav said he can be violent.
 - What did you say now, Gustav?

36
00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:45.040
- The truth.
 He fights on the weekends.
 - He trains judo.
 - It's a sport.

37
00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:51.320
In sports you use ball.
 Judo is about being kicked.

38
00:04:51.480 --> 00:04:59.120
-No!
 I was doing judo before.
 -Congratulations!
 Then you can fight out here.

39
00:04:59.280 --> 00:05:05.520
- When you come home?
 - Eight, if everything goes well.

40
00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:12.440
- Why wouldn't it?
 - Everything doesn't go as it should for you.

41
00:05:12.600 --> 00:05:20.200
-Hello.
 Does the wilderness nerve irritate you?
 - Yes, I can hardly stand still.

42
00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:25.200
- Is food there?
 - Dad took the last one.

43
00:05:25.360 --> 00:05:31.680
Eat properly now!
 This weekend you should be tamped with nature!

44
00:05:31.840 --> 00:05:38.760
- Do you always go to the mountains?
 -Just me.
 The bank has courses in Åre.

45
00:05:38.920 --> 00:05:46.440
Wonderfully!
 Slalom in the afternoon and very nice in the evenings.

46
00:05:48.200 --> 00:05:55.200
In the mountains you should devote yourself to nature, not to hostile luxury courses!

47
00:05:55.360 --> 00:06:00.200
Come on now, Gustav.
 You are jealous!

48
00:06:00.360 --> 00:06:06.400
At the post we have exciting courses, we too!

49
00:06:06.560 --> 00:06:14.680
- Why didn't you tell it?
 - News lectured the Director General.

50
00:06:14.840 --> 00:06:18.360
He scolded you.

51
00:06:18.520 --> 00:06:26.200
It was an interesting topic.
 "Sharpen you, otherwise we will put down the office."

52
00:06:26.880 --> 00:06:31.520
- I stand out again.
 -Have fun!

53
00:06:31.680 --> 00:06:37.520
Then I'll show you how to handle a throwing rod.

54
00:06:37.680 --> 00:06:42.400
Think ... father and son in God's free nature.

55
00:06:46.040 --> 00:06:49.480
-Hello!
 -Who is it?

56
00:06:49.640 --> 00:06:55.560
Sofia.
 My girl.
 We got together the day before yesterday.
 Bye!

57
00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:09.600
What is Max's doing?
 We were going to the mountains.

58
00:07:09.760 --> 00:07:14.960
I didn't know he met girls!

59
00:07:15.120 --> 00:07:21.720
Do not say so.
 It's just a friend who happens to be a girl.

60
00:07:21.880 --> 00:07:27.760
You could expect Lina Fjantar around, but Max ...!

61
00:07:27.920 --> 00:07:35.280
If he is going to go on Sofia's ballet, we cannot force him with us.

62
00:07:35.440 --> 00:07:40.040
Nonsense!
 It is the duty of the parents.

63
00:07:40.200 --> 00:07:46.680
Yes, you might be right.
 The kids grow faster than we think.

64
00:07:46.840 --> 00:07:53.800
- We have to hit the fist in the table!
 - Hit them to stop growing, right?

65
00:07:53.960 --> 00:08:01.400
No.
 But should you not ask what they feel, and such a hard time ...?

66
00:08:02.760 --> 00:08:09.000
We have not had a real conversation with Max in several years.

67
00:08:09.160 --> 00:08:14.000
Well, I scolded him out last yesterday.

68
00:08:14.160 --> 00:08:20.400
- You don't want to penetrate.
 - You can know something, so ...

69
00:08:20.560 --> 00:08:26.320
You are right.
 He must explain one and the other.

70
00:08:26.480 --> 00:08:32.720
-It's half past twelve!
 - Want to know how your son feels?

71
00:08:32.880 --> 00:08:36.160
Yes.
 About some years!

72
00:08:36.320 --> 00:08:43.280
Max, I want you to come up.
 So yes.
 Try to stand on the legs.

73
00:08:43.440 --> 00:08:48.040
Lina had broken the tennis trainer.

74
00:08:48.200 --> 00:08:53.200
- That's what I thought.
 Get her!
 -Silent!

75
00:08:53.360 --> 00:09:00.040
- We are curious.
 How do you feel Sofie?
 - She goes in the class next door.

76
00:09:00.200 --> 00:09:06.320
There you see.
 How did you meet?
 Was it at some disco?

77
00:09:06.480 --> 00:09:11.440
- No, she put the hook for me.
 -How cozy!

78
00:09:11.600 --> 00:09:16.080
- Can I go to bed?
 - No, we're going to talk.

79
00:09:16.240 --> 00:09:22.080
-Okay, talk on.
 - There is a lot going on with you now.

80
00:09:22.240 --> 00:09:26.680
You are faced with many new situations.

81
00:09:26.840 --> 00:09:34.280
Dad and I are here whatever you want to ask about.
 - Sure it is?

82
00:09:34.440 --> 00:09:41.400
But Gustav!
 - Do you want to ask me and dad about something?

83
00:09:41.560 --> 00:09:48.280
-Yes.
 May I lie down now?
 - It's nice to lighten one's heart.

84
00:09:48.440 --> 00:09:55.080
Okay.
 Sofia is with children, and I'm going to start drugs.
 Can I go?

85
00:09:55.240 --> 00:09:58.080
Certainly.

86
00:10:02.360 --> 00:10:08.200
We rent the cottage some weekend when the kids can come along.

87
00:10:08.360 --> 00:10:13.800
No!
 My God, we have our lives!

88
00:10:13.960 --> 00:10:22.160
We have as much fun without them.
 We can have great fun in the mountains, just the two of us.

89
00:10:22.320 --> 00:10:26.760
–And Styrbjörn.
 - The board of directors?

90
00:10:26.920 --> 00:10:30.560
Pettersson's dog.

91
00:10:31.720 --> 00:10:39.280
- What should we have it with?
 - It's not that dangerous?

92
00:10:39.440 --> 00:10:44.880
You don't know that ... what kind of race?

93
00:10:45.040 --> 00:10:52.160
The veterinarians said they had never seen anything like it.
 Good night!

94
00:10:57.920 --> 00:11:03.160
- Are they sour because you don't go with?
 -No.

95
00:11:03.320 --> 00:11:11.280
Your father seems determined.
 You are not used to someone sneaking on one all the time.

96
00:11:11.440 --> 00:11:16.920
He is like that.
 He just wants to check that you are okay.

97
00:11:22.960 --> 00:11:28.800
- Yeah, Marcus.
 Here you sit again ... - I know.

98
00:11:28.960 --> 00:11:36.520
- But I haven't been sitting for so long ... - Little Sports Mirror ... Good bet.

99
00:11:36.680 --> 00:11:44.240
Perfect balance between cartoon and regular sports elements.
 Right?

100
00:11:44.400 --> 00:11:50.560
- Yes, really.
 - Marcus has religious tests tomorrow.

101
00:11:50.720 --> 00:11:57.360
—Religion - so interesting.
 - Mest a lot of invented stories.

102
00:11:57.520 --> 00:12:03.160
They form the basis for how we live today.

103
00:12:03.320 --> 00:12:08.480
Take Jesus' hike in the desert.
 Jesus, Paul and ...

104
00:12:08.640 --> 00:12:12.360
... Bellman and a German?

105
00:12:12.520 --> 00:12:18.560
They had walked for 40 days, and had not eaten in a week.

106
00:12:18.720 --> 00:12:24.760
Paul asked: Shouldn't we give up?
 Then Jesus answered:

107
00:12:24.920 --> 00:12:29.560
- No, the letters must come up.
 - The letters?

108
00:12:29.720 --> 00:12:35.480
We have that setting at the post today.

109
00:12:35.640 --> 00:12:42.160
- Do you bare that Jesus was a postman?
 -Yes.
 One of the first.

110
00:12:42.320 --> 00:12:46.760
Okay.
 - Come on, we go up to my room.

111
00:12:47.920 --> 00:12:53.760
Ola Hedenius, 13, is investing in becoming a hockey professional.

112
00:12:53.920 --> 00:12:57.560
That's right, Ola!

113
00:12:57.720 --> 00:13:04.280
- Look, what we can borrow!
 - Freeze -dried food and down sleeping bag.

114
00:13:04.440 --> 00:13:11.880
Thanks, but it is not necessary.
 Lena and I intend to live on the conditions of nature.

115
00:13:12.040 --> 00:13:17.480
If you get hungry, you kill an animal.

116
00:13:17.640 --> 00:13:23.200
And if it gets cold ...?
 I borrow sleeping bags!

117
00:13:23.360 --> 00:13:29.000
- How does it feel to travel away alone?
 - Giant.

118
00:13:29.160 --> 00:13:33.600
It's been a long time since we traveled ourselves.

119
00:13:33.760 --> 00:13:40.200
If something is missing, I can fix it.
 Hello.

120
00:13:40.360 --> 00:13:47.000
Come and sit down, honey.
 The cottage seems to be very nice.

121
00:13:47.160 --> 00:13:55.200
- Here is Hovsjöleden.
 There is the cottage.
 –Usch ... it looks like a snuff spot.

122
00:13:55.360 --> 00:14:01.200
He had no pen.
 Do you see how close the river we live!

123
00:14:01.360 --> 00:14:04.600
How nice!

124
00:14:04.760 --> 00:14:10.320
Imagine, where we grill our freshly caught fish!

125
00:14:10.480 --> 00:14:15.520
Cozy!
 Why haven't we done that like that before?

126
00:14:15.680 --> 00:14:20.920
Yes ... In our age you have to affirm the adventure!

127
00:14:21.080 --> 00:14:27.520
Hello, kids.
 Dad and I sit and plan our weekend.

128
00:14:27.680 --> 00:14:33.920
-Where are you going?
 - Hovsjön.
 My friend has a farm there.

129
00:14:34.080 --> 00:14:41.480
- or a torpedo.
 Here goes the river.
 - Do you sing that you are not following?

130
00:14:41.640 --> 00:14:47.480
No.
 That is not a river.
 It is a power line.

131
00:14:48.640 --> 00:14:55.640
- It goes right at the house.
 -No danger.
 It goes high.

132
00:14:56.800 --> 00:15:02.560
- Gustav, do you know where my anorak is?
 - How so?

133
00:15:02.720 --> 00:15:08.760
- You extinguished the fire with?
 - It was just a grass fire.

134
00:15:08.920 --> 00:15:16.160
Dad lit up on Olssons when he was going to show how to make a fire.

135
00:15:16.320 --> 00:15:23.960
- Why didn't you tell it?
 - There is that your anorak managed!

136
00:15:24.120 --> 00:15:28.560
It is in the garage ... in the floor well.

137
00:15:28.720 --> 00:15:34.560
Well, it was you.
 Dad talked about it for several weeks!

138
00:15:34.720 --> 00:15:38.560
What is he working on then?

139
00:15:38.720 --> 00:15:44.560
- He is fire chief.
 - Do you want to have buns?
 One hundred?

140
00:15:47.040 --> 00:15:52.880
- What is in the garage?
 - A Volvo 242.

141
00:15:53.040 --> 00:15:56.680
What is chained.

142
00:15:56.840 --> 00:16:03.360
It's Styrbjörn.
 He came this morning.
 Surely he is cute?

143
00:16:03.520 --> 00:16:08.560
I do not know.
 He has a bag over his head!

144
00:16:08.720 --> 00:16:13.920
- Yes, he can't stand certain things.
 -What?

145
00:16:14.080 --> 00:16:17.720
People, daylight ...

146
00:16:24.680 --> 00:16:28.440
- Gustav!
 -Yes.

147
00:16:28.600 --> 00:16:34.280
Nämen ... I thought you had thrown the hippie jacket.

148
00:16:34.440 --> 00:16:40.280
It's not a hippie jacket, it's a wilderness garment!

149
00:16:41.440 --> 00:16:45.480
- What do you have there?
 - Harpun.

150
00:16:45.640 --> 00:16:51.080
- I have food with.
 - Imagine if there is a wolf!

151
00:16:51.240 --> 00:16:57.880
Then we run!
 Was Petterson disappointed when we didn't take Styrbjörn?

152
00:16:58.040 --> 00:17:03.960
-Yes.
 He had intended to invite people home.
 - Now it's just us.

153
00:17:04.120 --> 00:17:08.960
- It's like a second honeymoon.
 -Third.

154
00:17:09.120 --> 00:17:13.560
I don't count your aunt's hospital.

155
00:17:13.720 --> 00:17:20.600
We got a weekend in Nässjö.
 And the hospital food is not so stupid.

156
00:17:20.760 --> 00:17:27.560
- Hi, old man!
 Are you going to ballet?
 - There will be no ballet.

157
00:17:27.720 --> 00:17:35.520
Sofia is over.
 I'm going anyway.
 I go up and pack.

158
00:17:35.680 --> 00:17:41.120
If we stick directly, he does not notice anything.

159
00:17:42.680 --> 00:17:46.160
Max, stay.

160
00:17:46.320 --> 00:17:53.680
-Is it safe?
 Why is it over?
 - She didn't sit with me in the dining room.

161
00:17:53.840 --> 00:18:00.560
- then.
 What kind of food was that?
 - Max, tell us what happened.

162
00:18:00.720 --> 00:18:09.120
Do not know.
 She said I was not allowed to go to the ballet and then we became enemies.

163
00:18:09.280 --> 00:18:15.520
She might just be nervous about what you think.

164
00:18:15.680 --> 00:18:22.320
Come here ... Mom is right.
 Women can be so sometimes.

165
00:18:22.480 --> 00:18:28.920
Sometimes you can almost believe that they are stupid in the head ...

166
00:18:29.080 --> 00:18:33.520
Sofia is good much smarter than you!

167
00:18:34.480 --> 00:18:39.680
Sorry, I didn't mean that.
 Listen up.

168
00:18:39.840 --> 00:18:46.480
Sofia likes you.
 And then you get afraid to do away with it.

169
00:18:46.640 --> 00:18:52.200
Then you can do contrary to what you feel.

170
00:18:52.360 --> 00:18:58.200
- You will be insecure and ... cursed.
 -Why?

171
00:18:58.360 --> 00:19:02.800
What you ask!
 You do well ...

172
00:19:02.960 --> 00:19:08.480
- Lena!
 - I would rather go with you to the cottage.

173
00:19:08.640 --> 00:19:14.480
- There are fun things to do here.
 -Like what?

174
00:19:14.640 --> 00:19:21.480
- Puzzle you got from Grandma ... - Don't you want me to come along?

175
00:19:21.640 --> 00:19:25.280
Do you want the computer game ...?

176
00:19:25.440 --> 00:19:30.160
Sofie will be very happy if you come.

177
00:19:30.320 --> 00:19:35.080
-What did you do?
 - I called her.

178
00:19:35.240 --> 00:19:40.800
It was as I suspected.
 She was nervous.

179
00:19:40.960 --> 00:19:47.800
- I invited her here for dinner ... - then so ... should we go?

180
00:19:47.960 --> 00:19:55.400
- Be kind to Göran and Annika.
 - Hold an eye on Lina and Marcus.

181
00:19:55.560 --> 00:20:00.400
- Then we can talk about the computer game ... - kiss.

182
00:20:00.560 --> 00:20:05.560
- Ni is the world's best parents.
 -What did you say?

183
00:20:05.720 --> 00:20:10.160
You only say that one.
 Bye!

184
00:20:17.120 --> 00:20:21.960
Oh ... now it is napping again.
 How exiting!

185
00:20:22.120 --> 00:20:28.920
Oo!
 Nämen ... a tablet box!
 What it will be good!

186
00:20:29.080 --> 00:20:36.120
- Something who wants to see if it paces?
 - Can you be silent, we watch TV.

187
00:20:36.280 --> 00:20:43.640
- Pour the candy in a bowl.
 - What you are boring!
 - Start.

188
00:20:43.800 --> 00:20:46.960
Immediately?
 Certainly.

189
00:20:47.120 --> 00:20:54.200
-What should we do now?
 - Is it going night train to mom and dad?

190
00:20:54.360 --> 00:21:01.240
How fun it was to see the ballet.
 It was really ... different.

191
00:21:01.400 --> 00:21:08.520
- Wasn't it boring then?
 - Lite eventless.
 What was its name?

192
00:21:08.680 --> 00:21:12.320
"Sleeping stones" ...

193
00:21:12.480 --> 00:21:19.920
- Tight to stand still for four hours!
 –Okay ... Time for tonight's highlight.

194
00:21:20.080 --> 00:21:23.720
- Should you go home?
 -No.

195
00:21:23.880 --> 00:21:30.040
- Do you know what this is?
 - A magic box, I'm afraid.

196
00:21:30.200 --> 00:21:36.240
-Right!
 Do you know what this is?
 - A magic wand.

197
00:21:41.760 --> 00:21:48.200
You are welcome.
 - I wanted to become the world's best magician.

198
00:21:48.360 --> 00:21:53.920
- You became the worst in the world.
 - What should I conjure away?

199
00:21:54.080 --> 00:21:59.120
-Yourself.
 -Come on!
 It's great fun.

200
00:21:59.280 --> 00:22:04.120
I think we are too old for this.

201
00:22:04.280 --> 00:22:11.320
We intend to make it nice for you, whether you want to or not!

202
00:22:11.480 --> 00:22:16.880
- Can we not watch video?
 - You had a movie.

203
00:22:17.040 --> 00:22:20.880
Yes, a romantic comedy ...

204
00:22:21.040 --> 00:22:26.880
- "The avenger from hell."
 - You can't see!

205
00:22:27.040 --> 00:22:34.400
I know, we have a disco!
 - Get our plates, and I'll clear away here.

206
00:22:34.560 --> 00:22:42.000
-What then?
 Should I stop trolling?
 - This is needed!
 Chips and juice!

207
00:22:44.280 --> 00:22:49.080
Dad!
 Tell Göran and Annika to go home.

208
00:22:49.240 --> 00:22:54.440
- What are you doing at home already?
 -What do you mean?

209
00:22:54.600 --> 00:23:02.240
- You would come tomorrow night.
 - A day here or there ... it was enough.

210
00:23:02.400 --> 00:23:09.600
I have to correct you.
 The line next to the cottage meant rail!

211
00:23:09.760 --> 00:23:17.840
- The train passed by every five minutes!
 - Why didn't Pettersson have said anything?

212
00:23:18.000 --> 00:23:25.640
We will find out that.
 We will fix an anesthetic gun for Styrbjörn ...

213
00:24:07.000 --> 00:24:09.440
