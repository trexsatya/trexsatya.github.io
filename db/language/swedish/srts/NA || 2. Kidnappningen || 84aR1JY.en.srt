1
00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:05.520
It's not any fucking girl who comes here, Billy.

2
00:00:05.680 --> 00:00:09.920
You are so handsome, so beautiful!
 And so sexy ...

3
00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:15.640
-Satan ... - you owe me 100,000.

4
00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:23.160
You have to pay, otherwise you will never see her again.

5
00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:30.040
Irja ... No!
 IRJA !!

6
00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:41.320
Mobile signal

7
00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:46.240
That's him.
 I might as well kill myself.

8
00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:51.880
-Respond.
 Stop it.
 Just take it.
 -Oh my God...

9
00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:59.320
-Leif ... listen carefully now, thick.

10
00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:05.760
You have 24 hours to fix the money, then I kill the dear.

11
00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:09.960
- Snug Leif, they are so nasty to me.
 --Irja?
 Ija!

12
00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:15.480
Take it easy, I'll free you.
 Irja?
 Hello?

13
00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:24.160
Cursed!
 I have met the woman in my life.

14
00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:30.520
We would just start making children, and then they come and kidnap her.

15
00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:36.400
Welcome to Leif's universe, where everything just fucks out!

16
00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:44.680
100,000 in 24 hours.
 How the hell should we manage to get it together?

17
00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:49.160
We may try to sell something.

18
00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:53.800
Selling something?
 God, what a good idea, Billy!

19
00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:59.880
Did you hear what smart boy?
 We sell something and it will resolve.

20
00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:05.560
What should we sell for 100,000?
 We just have scrap.
 Volvon?

21
00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:09.680
Should we post it on the block?

22
00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:15.800
Full of bird piss and slaughter residues.
 100,000 - bargain and clear.

23
00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:21.400
- It was a proposal, Leif.
 -Oh my God.

24
00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:29.520
I have to go down on my bare knees.
 Down in the dirt and make shit.

25
00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:32.840
There is nothing else now.

26
00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:40.440
We get to beg money with the neighbors.

27
00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:46.960
Hello!

28
00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:52.520
- Tjena, Tony.
 -Hello.
 What do you want, then?

29
00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:58.680
We were going to check if you would like to buy a service from us.

30
00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:01.880
No.

31
00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:08.320
- I can mow the grass for a year.
 -No I do not want to.

32
00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:13.720
Billy can wash for you for a year for 10,000.

33
00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:18.160
It's a good offer, really.

34
00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:23.840
- No, there will be nothing with that.
 - I will put the cards on the table.

35
00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:29.960
I sit in an economic trouble and would have to borrow money.

36
00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:34.520
Could I be able to borrow 10,000?

37
00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:38.520
-Obvious.
 -For real?

38
00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:44.360
If you sit tight, it is clear that I help.

39
00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:50.400
Here you have one ... I had one more ... there!

40
00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:54.560
- There you have another one.
 -Good.
 Thanks.

41
00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:59.320
I have more in here.
 Here is a ... on the shelf.

42
00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:02.000
Where are you going?

43
00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:08.240
- Tjena, Bullen.
 - Hi, boys.

44
00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:15.160
Me and my brother go around to the neighbors and offer services.

45
00:04:15.320 --> 00:04:20.760
- We need extra money.
 -Are you interested?

46
00:04:20.920 --> 00:04:24.680
Well, you think so?

47
00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:31.960
I don't know if that's something I would need to do.
 I do not think so.

48
00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:37.960
We do anything.
 We can rake or wash.

49
00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:43.360
Soot the chimney or clean the gutters.

50
00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:46.960
Do you hear ... boys ...

51
00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:55.520
It is bad about women here and it was a long time since I had to empty myself.

52
00:04:55.680 --> 00:05:01.760
We do not conduct any pimp operations.
 We can't fix women's timber.

53
00:05:01.920 --> 00:05:06.520
You probably have a mouth, you too ...

54
00:05:08.640 --> 00:05:12.800
Stop!
 No.
 It is a misunderstanding.

55
00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:17.680
- You get 10,000. It's going fast.
 -No in my entire life.

56
00:05:17.840 --> 00:05:23.480
Fy fuck, the bun.
 I didn't believe that about you.

57
00:05:23.640 --> 00:05:29.840
You know where the door is if you change.
 10,000 ...

58
00:05:42.120 --> 00:05:45.920
Not a bastard wants to help.

59
00:05:47.960 --> 00:05:54.520
- I get to go and rob the bank.
 - You should not rob any bank.

60
00:05:54.680 --> 00:06:00.440
Then I might as well kill myself, if Irja is to die.

61
00:06:00.600 --> 00:06:04.560
We go to the mother and say hello.

62
00:06:04.720 --> 00:06:10.640
It is her birthday today.
 I promise we will be on something.

63
00:06:10.800 --> 00:06:14.640
It's just a lot now, Billy.

64
00:06:57.400 --> 00:07:05.000
Happy birthday mom.
 We wish you were here.

65
00:07:05.160 --> 00:07:11.680
It would have been brilliant if you got to see which achievements we succeed in.

66
00:07:11.840 --> 00:07:17.960
We manage to get fatter even though we live on the minimum of existence.

67
00:07:18.120 --> 00:07:24.240
Thank you for putting me to life!
 Nothing works.

68
00:07:24.400 --> 00:07:31.560
Everything just sucks!
 We can't even take care of a woman.

69
00:07:31.720 --> 00:07:37.880
- Curse fucking piss life!
 - Not at the mother's grave.

70
00:07:39.480 --> 00:07:46.840
We are not completely useless.
 I have kept the same weight for three months.

71
00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:52.480
Leif is grumpy because his girl has been kidnapped.

72
00:07:52.640 --> 00:07:56.160
That's why we need money.

73
00:07:56.320 --> 00:08:01.800
Do you remember the jewelry mom wore when she was buried?

74
00:08:20.440 --> 00:08:24.920
- Put off, Leif.
 - Did you know what it is worth?

75
00:08:25.080 --> 00:08:31.800
- We can buy sweets for ten years.
 - She should bring it to the angels.

76
00:08:31.960 --> 00:08:37.680
-Good night mom.
 - But God cursed, Billy.

77
00:08:37.840 --> 00:08:43.360
She is dead.
 She doesn't understand.
 It's a like you talk to.

78
00:08:43.520 --> 00:08:47.160
Come, we have jobs to do.

79
00:08:50.360 --> 00:08:55.720
Two meters down we have the answers to all our problems.

80
00:09:00.400 --> 00:09:03.400
No...

81
00:09:03.560 --> 00:09:08.160
No no no!
 Never in my life!

82
00:09:08.320 --> 00:09:12.400
We can sell it and save Irja.

83
00:09:12.560 --> 00:09:17.960
I don't let you shield the mother's grave!
 Never!

84
00:09:18.120 --> 00:09:23.760
Okay ... - you hear, mom.
 It's a nice, little guy we have.

85
00:09:23.920 --> 00:09:31.000
He became moral in older days.
 Now he can finally dry his ass.

86
00:09:31.160 --> 00:09:36.680
Happy Birthday.
 Congratulations to Billy which is so good.

87
00:09:40.120 --> 00:09:43.360
See you, the mother.

88
00:10:06.520 --> 00:10:10.680
Tjena ... are you already awake?

89
00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:15.360
Where have you been?

90
00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:25.800
- I have fixed 90,000. - How then?

91
00:10:25.960 --> 00:10:33.000
I went another beggar round and Anderssons had won on the trot.

92
00:10:33.160 --> 00:10:36.720
That's good.

93
00:10:48.840 --> 00:10:54.440
- You did, huh?
 Admitted!
 - Take it easy, Billy.

94
00:10:54.600 --> 00:10:58.120
You were violating the mother's grave.

95
00:10:58.280 --> 00:11:04.560
You plundered our own mother's grave.
 That's what you did ...

96
00:11:09.520 --> 00:11:12.160
Sorry, Billy.

97
00:11:22.320 --> 00:11:26.000
Now damn damn!

98
00:11:27.600 --> 00:11:30.320
Your damn!

99
00:11:30.480 --> 00:11:34.040
-I hate you!
 -Stop...

100
00:11:34.200 --> 00:11:39.160
- I kill you!
 - Don't you see the whole?

101
00:11:39.320 --> 00:11:44.320
Two women - mom and Irja.
 Yin and yang.

102
00:11:44.480 --> 00:11:48.680
My sperm for further our genes.

103
00:11:48.840 --> 00:11:54.800
Everything is connected.
 The circle closes, and the jewelry was the key.

104
00:11:54.960 --> 00:12:01.400
I pledged the necklace.
 We can fix it back later.

105
00:12:01.560 --> 00:12:08.400
- The mother had wanted to.
 - Look that we buy it back!

106
00:12:08.560 --> 00:12:12.320
I promise, Billy!

107
00:12:13.480 --> 00:12:16.000
Away...

108
00:12:31.120 --> 00:12:35.360
After all, 10,000 are still missing.

109
00:12:47.880 --> 00:12:50.680
Wait here, Billy.

110
00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:29.040
TV sound

111
00:13:32.640 --> 00:13:35.680
The door opens

112
00:13:39.280 --> 00:13:42.280
Vomit sound

113
00:13:42.440 --> 00:13:46.520
What did you do at Bullen?

114
00:13:46.680 --> 00:13:52.480
I saw that you went in to him.
 How did you get the money?

115
00:13:52.640 --> 00:14:00.200
Have you become a fucking spy?
 You are constantly checking what I do.

116
00:14:00.360 --> 00:14:04.560
Okay, I went to the bun!
 Sorry.

117
00:14:04.720 --> 00:14:10.000
I threatened him.
 "If I can't borrow money, I murder you."

118
00:14:10.160 --> 00:14:13.520
So he lent them.

119
00:14:13.680 --> 00:14:19.560
- I thought if you might have ... - cursed!

120
00:14:19.720 --> 00:14:26.400
I save the life of Irja and you ask like a eroded birdhouse.

121
00:14:26.560 --> 00:14:32.080
We have to go.
 We will meet the can in 40 minutes.

122
00:14:32.240 --> 00:14:35.840
He should get his fucking money.

123
00:14:36.840 --> 00:14:39.480
Come!

124
00:15:05.800 --> 00:15:11.160
Have you seen!
 Isn't it the fat brothers who have arrived?

125
00:15:11.320 --> 00:15:14.240
In time too.

126
00:15:14.400 --> 00:15:20.160
- We have the money with us too.
 - Good, Leif.

127
00:15:20.320 --> 00:15:25.320
You can trust you.
 I get the money.

128
00:15:25.480 --> 00:15:31.240
You should get your money, but first I want to see Irja.

129
00:15:44.320 --> 00:15:49.520
Hey Baby.
 Everything will be fine.
 Just be calm.

130
00:15:49.680 --> 00:15:53.280
Here she is.
 The money first.

131
00:15:57.840 --> 00:16:01.440
No danger, irja.
 You can be calm.

132
00:16:01.600 --> 00:16:08.640
Look at fuck!
 You have fixed all the money.
 How good you are!

133
00:16:08.800 --> 00:16:11.800
Release irja now.

134
00:16:13.680 --> 00:16:17.880
It's quiet, Irja.
 I'll save you.

135
00:16:26.280 --> 00:16:29.600
Come ... Irja, come.

136
00:16:30.720 --> 00:16:32.960
Irja?

137
00:16:37.600 --> 00:16:40.680
Irja, what are you doing?

138
00:16:51.400 --> 00:16:56.880
-What is going on?
 - Consult me, Leif.
 I needed the money.

139
00:16:57.040 --> 00:17:00.760
But I loved you, and ...

140
00:17:06.920 --> 00:17:13.760
Your peas!
 It was we who planted Irja from the beginning.

141
00:17:16.640 --> 00:17:20.080
Please Irja, say it's not true.

142
00:17:21.040 --> 00:17:25.480
-Forgive me.
 -I love you.

143
00:17:26.280 --> 00:17:31.440
Yes, fat!
 Then you were free from your debts.

144
00:17:35.280 --> 00:17:39.920
Irja ... please don't do this.

145
00:17:40.080 --> 00:17:42.560
I love...

146
00:18:45.160 --> 00:18:51.480
You did it anyway!
 Why didn't you say you had sex with Irja?

147
00:18:51.640 --> 00:18:58.200
- I haven't had sex with Irja.
 - What is this, then?

148
00:19:00.680 --> 00:19:04.880
The Northern sexture!

149
00:19:05.040 --> 00:19:07.880
Good job, the brother.

150
00:19:14.800 --> 00:19:18.800
Vomit sound

151
00:19:34.840 --> 00:19:39.440
