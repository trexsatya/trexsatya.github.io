00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:11.160
Diversity Charter Sweden is part of the world's largest network for diversity

3
00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:15.799
and inclusion questions for those who believe in ongoing knowledge refill

4
00:00:15.799 --> 00:00:20.320
and together with others want to move forward your

5
00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:29.960
Positions Warmly welcome to spring's last Friday creation My name is Anna

6
00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:35.040
Carlsson Sigstedt and Secretary General of Diversity Charter Sweden and today so is

7
00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:39.079
It the last day at Diversity Month something we have done together

8
00:00:39.079 --> 00:00:45.239
with the entire EU the 27 countries where we have really focused on showing

9
00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:51.960
the weight and of a more inclusive working life and there have been made lots of different

10
00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:56.640
activities I have seen someone have produced a movie I have seen some

11
00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:00.879
big banks that have been out and gone and in this way talked more about these

12
00:01:00.879 --> 00:01:05.280
the questions and there have been lots of different seminars so it has been very much

13
00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:09.040
And there you can go in and look at the Diversity Month website therefore you can

14
00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:12.200
Of course click on activities and see what has been done in the different countries

15
00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:15.360
And it may happen that there are still activities today and among

16
00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:19.320
Otherwise, there is this activity Friday's knowledge since we have the last

17
00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:23.400
Friday in every month and today we actually have one

18
00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:29.119
small unique prior knowledge for the first time so we have gathered the representative from

19
00:01:29.119 --> 00:01:34.000
All the Riksdag parties and we are the party we do not belong to any party but we

20
00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:38.880
think it is so important to be in the service of democracy and especially now that

21
00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:43.320
here the euval which is June 9 and when I talk to people about the election, people can be

22
00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:47.119
So no yes, a choice now comes they have not so much information and then thought

23
00:01:47.119 --> 00:01:51.360
We like this then we want to serve for you what the parliamentary parties do in these

24
00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:54.799
the questions we are passionate so much for a more inclusive

25
00:01:54.799 --> 00:01:59.520
work life and as usual, it is not me who will lead this call in

26
00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:02.439
Today we brought in a

27
00:02:05.119 --> 00:02:12.080
Professional model from Lead 20 Thank you so much Anna Thanks for being here eh yes

28
00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:17.000
and I have received the great benefit and moderate this call and my name is

29
00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:23.000
As I said Liselott v Her Maggie Eh and I think that this moderator's role

30
00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:29.200
Today might rather be about being a little time pair

31
00:02:29.959 --> 00:02:33.120
These candidates to the European Parliament from the various parties and we want to

32
00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:37.080
they should have space all to come to speak so if they think I am a bit

33
00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:41.040
hard and go in and say that now the time is out, it is just because I want to

34
00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:47.360
Everyone should have the time that, like yes, they should be entitled to so to speak eh but we are so

35
00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:53.480
Glad we have several candidates with us today eh and participate in this

36
00:02:53.480 --> 00:03:01.280
The conversation makes Abir Al Salani from the Center Party Eh M Hollis as

37
00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:05.720
represents the Christian Democrats Karin Karlsbro from

38
00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:13.319
Liberals Magnus P Volin from the Environmental Party The Green Evin Ins from

39
00:03:13.319 --> 00:03:20.159
Social Democrats Jesper Skarberg Karlsson from the Moderates and Z Vera as

40
00:03:20.159 --> 00:03:23.920
represents the Left Party eh Sweden Democrats' representative's shoulder

41
00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:29.760
also been involved but have been prevented so those candidates should we listen to

42
00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:33.200
Eh but i want to give some instructions it is that we have one

43
00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:37.560
chat but in this Friday fun creator you will not be able to ask questions in

44
00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:42.480
The chat on the other hand, there will be ongoing information eh we will also

45
00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:47.760
set up a link to the page where all parties have answered questions about how they

46
00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:52.280
will drive diversity and inclusion perspective in the EU and it is

47
00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:57.959
What is the theme of this call the arrangement will be like that

48
00:03:57.959 --> 00:04:02.720
that all candidates will get first three minutes were to lift it as they

49
00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:06.000
think is most important the most important thing they will drive linked to these

50
00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:12.079
the questions in the Eup Parliament EH and then we will make one to round a couple

51
00:04:12.079 --> 00:04:15.360
minutes where each representative is allowed to comment on something that is said or

52
00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:19.639
clarify some of what one wants to highlight from one's party and so can

53
00:04:19.639 --> 00:04:21.960
it be that I can with some one too

54
00:04:21.960 --> 00:04:27.560
follow -up question but i should not take up more time but i was going to leave over instead

55
00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:33.039
the word to the first of our candidates to the Eup Parliament and then

56
00:04:33.039 --> 00:04:39.400
Do I want to give the word to you abir from the center party

57
00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:45.000
Please thank you so much and for this seminar and for the invitation because I

58
00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:50.080
may be here and good morning on you all all committed people in

59
00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:56.479
diversity issues my name is abir and i have previously worked

60
00:04:56.479 --> 00:05:02.440
with diversity as diversity as a project for a diversity project that we had what

61
00:05:02.440 --> 00:05:10.080
Applies to precisely political organizations and eh it is a very big job

62
00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:17.240
But with diversity and much is actually about both political will and

63
00:05:17.240 --> 00:05:24.400
Priority and leadership eh I Center Party consider that many of

64
00:05:24.400 --> 00:05:29.520
labor market issues in the first place should be handled by

65
00:05:29.759 --> 00:05:35.600
had in Sweden a tradition of eh and that is because it is after all

66
00:05:54.639 --> 00:05:58.800
Labor market policy works at I level or at home in Sweden should detail

67
00:05:58.800 --> 00:06:04.400
The labor market, for example, through the works quotation or

68
00:06:06.960 --> 00:06:12.919
The wage guarantee hike, on the other hand, should, after all, guarantee all people's

69
00:06:12.919 --> 00:06:17.720
equal rights and opportunities for example by ensuring protection against

70
00:06:17.720 --> 00:06:23.000
After all, discrimination and the Center Party have worked actively on the issue of EU

71
00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:26.120
common standards for equality body

72
00:06:26.120 --> 00:06:30.479
Eh what is then equivalent to discrimination as the man in Sweden we

73
00:06:30.479 --> 00:06:35.800
have pushed on politically for the Council of Ministers to adopt

74
00:06:43.720 --> 00:06:46.800
Anti -discrimination agency Fald without it must also be a legal

75
00:06:46.800 --> 00:06:50.840
Backing and Antidal Discrimination Date

76
00:06:59.639 --> 00:07:04.160
also create a union for all eh a union that is available to all there

77
00:07:04.160 --> 00:07:09.720
our freedoms that we have won as citizens should also apply to everyone on the same

78
00:07:09.720 --> 00:07:13.919
way and therefore the functional law council has

79
00:07:18.840 --> 00:07:25.160
with and lately we have as one as a profit that we have then won is after all

80
00:07:25.160 --> 00:07:28.160
The Functional Law Convention

81
00:07:29.759 --> 00:07:34.759
within the Union for people with different disabilities and that I

82
00:07:34.759 --> 00:07:39.759
would like to be that then eh work continued to work as we have done

83
00:07:39.759 --> 00:07:43.400
In the Center Party that we wear three glasses that we have then as we

84
00:07:43.400 --> 00:07:47.759
The Center Party considers incredibly important one to be equal

85
00:07:47.759 --> 00:07:51.599
the equality perspective between men and women it is

86
00:07:51.599 --> 00:07:57.560
functional right and that is the anti -racist perspective and by having these three

87
00:07:57.560 --> 00:08:02.199
different glasses all the time on in on it when we work with

88
00:08:02.199 --> 00:08:07.479
Legislation so we believe that we can also take concrete steps forward in terms of increased

89
00:08:07.479 --> 00:08:13.000
Diversity but one last thing I want to say is that representation Matters and

90
00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:18.960
It doesn't matter how eh how well one speaks of diversity

91
00:08:18.960 --> 00:08:23.759
If you look at the parties' lists, I think that including my own party

92
00:08:23.759 --> 00:08:29.680
I am equally critical of all, so it leaves a part to be desired in terms of eh

93
00:08:29.680 --> 00:08:35.719
diversity of different candidates so we have a lot to do and work on both

94
00:08:35.719 --> 00:08:39.360
internally in political life at home in Sweden that party political life but

95
00:08:39.360 --> 00:08:41.560
also

96
00:08:44.290 --> 00:08:48.320
[Music] Legislative Power to Mikaela afterwards

97
00:08:48.320 --> 00:08:52.600
that presents the Christian Democrats

98
00:08:52.600 --> 00:08:57.760
Mikaela thanks so very much Mikel Hollis is my name I come from Gränna there

99
00:08:57.760 --> 00:09:01.360
Karin is sitting now so I see my old high school and its flags in

100
00:09:01.360 --> 00:09:07.200
background nice to see this we this morning eh very fun to be

101
00:09:07.200 --> 00:09:11.040
here very fun to get into these issues I am not sitting in

102
00:09:11.040 --> 00:09:15.079
The European Parliament so it becomes that you can read as well as what has been said

103
00:09:15.079 --> 00:09:19.680
the last eh five years but i think this has been exciting questions to

104
00:09:19.680 --> 00:09:24.440
Get to learn more about too and I thank you so much for arranging

105
00:09:24.440 --> 00:09:30.440
This this morning I work for everyday as General Secretary for

106
00:09:30.440 --> 00:09:35.880
Christian Democratic International Center We work a lot with countries where not

107
00:09:35.880 --> 00:09:39.480
is there any democracy or there is very little democracy and a lot of it

108
00:09:39.480 --> 00:09:43.720
work we do and in all parties represented here have such

109
00:09:43.720 --> 00:09:48.760
organizations and what you work it it is precisely to get eh groups that

110
00:09:48.760 --> 00:09:54.600
are under -represented eh and strengthen them in politics eh and so there is some kind

111
00:09:54.600 --> 00:09:59.600
anti -discrimination we work with that I still work with for everyday ehm

112
00:09:59.600 --> 00:10:03.880
And for the Christian Democrats and I mean sure it is for everyone here

113
00:10:03.880 --> 00:10:07.720
so these questions are about an inclusive working life very very

114
00:10:07.720 --> 00:10:13.480
Important but with that said so so we still think that

115
00:10:13.480 --> 00:10:19.000
labor market policy is something that one should have at national level and as

116
00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:24.600
We the member states ourselves should control the eh and then of course we have an Indre

117
00:10:24.600 --> 00:10:29.320
market where we compete with each other eh and then it is clear that we think that

118
00:10:29.320 --> 00:10:33.399
Also the countries that are part of the internal market must have the nice conditions

119
00:10:33.399 --> 00:10:39.079
eh and work against discrimination eh but in Sweden we have a very

120
00:10:39.079 --> 00:10:43.040
strong discrimination protection EH in the Discrimination Act

121
00:10:43.040 --> 00:10:49.240
eh and that it involves all forms of discrimination and ensures that they

122
00:10:49.240 --> 00:10:53.680
Human rights are respected in working life and on a number of other

123
00:10:53.680 --> 00:10:58.399
social areas ehm and there decides there are also

124
00:10:58.399 --> 00:11:02.240
provision for employers to work very actively and continuously

125
00:11:02.240 --> 00:11:06.360
also to strengthen these rights and, like all the time

126
00:11:06.360 --> 00:11:09.200
work so that there is no discrimination

127
00:11:09.200 --> 00:11:14.480
Eh but I think we can have a stronger exchange of experience in Europe VI i

128
00:11:14.480 --> 00:11:19.120
Sweden we often hit our chest because we are the best in these questions eh

129
00:11:19.120 --> 00:11:24.959
maybe we are not always but we can also be eh be good at that

130
00:11:24.959 --> 00:11:29.800
Exchange experiences I think eh But the Christian Democrats do not believe you should

131
00:11:29.800 --> 00:11:34.279
lift up these issues eh at an eunal level for there is risk then we

132
00:11:34.279 --> 00:11:39.160
Compromise with what works well in Sweden and we don't want to do that

133
00:11:39.160 --> 00:11:45.360
I still emphasize eh so should see a little more jo eh yes but one thing like me too

134
00:11:45.360 --> 00:11:51.040
want to say that is that a challenge ahead we think is that if one now as well as

135
00:11:51.040 --> 00:11:55.000
proceed at eunal level to go into these issues and that it becomes for

136
00:11:55.000 --> 00:12:01.000
Of course, detail rules eh there are a number of conventions that are eh that are

137
00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:03.600
very good and I know abir mentioned this with working to

138
00:12:03.600 --> 00:12:08.839
Disabled people should be given rights in working life and so on and that is

139
00:12:08.839 --> 00:12:13.279
something that all of which all countries must take their responsibility and the EU states there

140
00:12:13.279 --> 00:12:18.279
the strengthened in terms of basic human rights and that we must

141
00:12:18.279 --> 00:12:23.440
protect eh all people so it is important but we don't think we need

142
00:12:23.440 --> 00:12:27.560
lift it up at euns level with special directives in that way and then begins

143
00:12:27.560 --> 00:12:32.959
Finally with regard to EH companies' sustainability reporting, we think that

144
00:12:32.959 --> 00:12:38.560
It is very good thus this CS RD Directive EH which was one of the questions

145
00:12:38.560 --> 00:12:42.880
from you but I still want to say that we may be careful so that it does not become

146
00:12:42.880 --> 00:12:47.560
Too great workload for small businesses so that you can't cope with that

147
00:12:47.560 --> 00:12:50.959
becomes too much administration It is clear that large companies can handle this

148
00:12:50.959 --> 00:12:56.480
good but but we must also make sure not to have too much eh detail regulation in

149
00:12:56.480 --> 00:13:01.480
In the EU that's what I wanted to say thank you so very big thanks Mikael thanks for

150
00:13:01.480 --> 00:13:06.279
That then I think I should invite the next representative and then it will be Karin

151
00:13:06.279 --> 00:13:09.600
representing the Liberals and I will say that I know that several of you are

152
00:13:09.600 --> 00:13:14.959
after all in the middle of campaign several of these candidates eh so that it is very happy

153
00:13:14.959 --> 00:13:18.160
That you are with us I know Karin is one of those who are on the move but

154
00:13:18.160 --> 00:13:23.279
Please Karin thank you so much eh yes my name is

155
00:13:23.279 --> 00:13:29.199
Karin Karlsbro I am the top candidate of the Liberals eh I'm just as you said

156
00:13:29.199 --> 00:13:33.519
I'm on a trip I'm on my way to Stockholm but right now I'm sitting on

157
00:13:33.519 --> 00:13:40.760
a park bench in beautiful Gränna so I Mikaela in your home areas and it was

158
00:13:40.760 --> 00:13:45.279
Great to be able to share the morning coffee and a little lovely moment in this

159
00:13:45.279 --> 00:13:50.600
hectic time with you and talk about these important issues and

160
00:13:50.600 --> 00:13:55.839
Before I became a European Parliamentarian as I became in 2019, I worked as

161
00:13:55.839 --> 00:14:00.720
sustainability manager in the real estate industry so that these issues are also lies

162
00:14:00.720 --> 00:14:04.360
personally in the professional life very hot about

163
00:14:04.360 --> 00:14:11.199
The heart the Liberals go to election on a message a stronger Europe for a

164
00:14:11.199 --> 00:14:17.399
Stronger Sweden and we live in a very dangerous time with Russia's war

165
00:14:17.399 --> 00:14:23.839
against Ukraine who threatens everyone's peace and freedom and we liberals say we we

166
00:14:23.839 --> 00:14:30.800
want to see a stronger EU that stands up against Russia that can stop the war that can

167
00:14:30.800 --> 00:14:35.759
take on the common challenges that Europe stands

168
00:14:35.759 --> 00:14:42.000
For those issues that do not stop at national borders, there are parties that

169
00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:46.600
We make sure on the outer edges both to the left and right who want to see a

170
00:14:46.600 --> 00:14:52.120
weaker EU or a decent EU and then we want to exactly

171
00:14:52.120 --> 00:14:56.800
on the contrary, we think that the issue of human rights for that is

172
00:14:56.800 --> 00:15:02.240
actually what we talk about democrat and human rights is a matter

173
00:15:02.240 --> 00:15:08.000
that lacks boundaries that we have to handle jointly together over

174
00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:14.480
national borders and between countries that they are far too important to not yes

175
00:15:14.480 --> 00:15:20.759
simply ending a pact globally and we have at the UN level global level eh come

176
00:15:20.759 --> 00:15:27.320
a bit late in compliance catastrophic but eunal level is actually very important for

177
00:15:27.320 --> 00:15:34.279
these issues and at this time where we yes wrestle with war with freedom

178
00:15:34.279 --> 00:15:40.920
and oppression and we see how democracy is mounted down in several EU countries and threatened

179
00:15:40.920 --> 00:15:45.000
I think primarily about what has happened in Hungary development in Hungary de

180
00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:51.560
In recent years, we should be aware that eh EU Europe is not vaccinated either

181
00:15:51.560 --> 00:15:59.040
against eh one one very negative development and there the EU comes in and we

182
00:15:59.040 --> 00:16:04.240
thinks it is important that just these issues of human rights

183
00:16:04.240 --> 00:16:09.560
actually lies at euns level that's not details that is where this is exactly where we

184
00:16:09.560 --> 00:16:16.160
Must be because our vision is that the EU is a home port for democracies internally

185
00:16:16.160 --> 00:16:21.519
in Europe but also a strong vote globally for a democratic world and are one with

186
00:16:21.519 --> 00:16:25.199
In the EU then they have actually signed to stand up for democracy and

187
00:16:25.199 --> 00:16:29.120
Human rights and countries that violate those like Hungary for example

188
00:16:29.120 --> 00:16:34.199
To yes, you should withdraw the support for you should be sanctioned to get rid of

189
00:16:34.199 --> 00:16:39.680
voting right eh because eh man it is simply not acceptable

190
00:16:39.680 --> 00:16:46.600
eh with dismantling democracy, you also see a negative development for

191
00:16:46.600 --> 00:16:52.519
eh diversity issues eh gender equality issues eh and all questions

192
00:16:52.519 --> 00:16:56.079
that are linked to this so you can't see it isolated and it is

193
00:16:56.079 --> 00:17:00.920
Therefore, it is so important to protect this and in terms of what the EU can

194
00:17:00.920 --> 00:17:05.720
and should do in concrete terms so my colleagues have mentioned some things and we are

195
00:17:05.720 --> 00:17:11.160
also very positive tilla discrimination or antidime

196
00:17:14.120 --> 00:17:17.120
Discrimination date

197
00:17:19.160 --> 00:17:25.760
in the EU to eh we have an internal market a common labor market and certainly we

198
00:17:25.760 --> 00:17:30.240
Also defends the Swedish model EH it is a bite support the Swedish

199
00:17:30.240 --> 00:17:36.720
the parties but the issue of gender equality is also a human rights issue

200
00:17:38.880 --> 00:17:44.280
eh then when it comes to eh sustainability reporting and the eh de

201
00:17:44.280 --> 00:17:49.039
the questions then there is something that is left to stay and we also see in

202
00:17:49.039 --> 00:17:53.840
other eula law that social sustainability is woven in I have to

203
00:17:53.840 --> 00:17:57.760
Example negotiated EU's

204
00:17:59.120 --> 00:18:05.360
Sustainability to do you can think of yes today when we work with such a pretty

205
00:18:05.360 --> 00:18:11.240
Technical really climate law founding so you weave in human rights eh

206
00:18:11.240 --> 00:18:15.799
working conditions eh elsewhere in the world so that it is also linked to

207
00:18:15.799 --> 00:18:21.200
This but in the end the EU is one union and should be and we have to guard guard

208
00:18:21.200 --> 00:18:28.799
about E's role as union for democracies and then racism eh homophobia has Islamophobia

209
00:18:28.799 --> 00:18:34.640
In anti -Semitism and all that now we can put words into has no place in our

210
00:18:34.640 --> 00:18:41.159
Union and then we together have to set up rules EH that counteracts eh hatred and

211
00:18:41.159 --> 00:18:45.919
threats and the restriction of

212
00:18:59.000 --> 00:19:04.360
AG and organizations jobs together in the same direction but don't forget EU weight in

213
00:19:04.360 --> 00:19:08.960
This I stay there and then I will turn off the camera because we will sit in

214
00:19:08.960 --> 00:19:13.400
The car and drive on to Stockholm but I am listening and hope can

215
00:19:13.400 --> 00:19:18.159
jump in but only I apologize that it might get a little a little worse a little

216
00:19:18.159 --> 00:19:23.080
worse sound and picture and so on but then you know why no danger giant attack too

217
00:19:23.080 --> 00:19:29.400
you Karin eh I quickly leave the word to Magnus representing

218
00:19:29.400 --> 00:19:34.480
Environmental Party The Greens Be Magnus Yes but thank you so much my name

219
00:19:34.480 --> 00:19:40.320
Magnus Pevin and is Municipal Restsjö but also number four on the Environmental Party's list

220
00:19:40.320 --> 00:19:45.280
to the euval and it is very exciting times eh right now of course

221
00:19:45.280 --> 00:19:48.760
And I would have been out and campaigned today too but have I gone on throat flux

222
00:19:48.760 --> 00:19:54.720
So I get to sit at home and take care of the work digitally instead of this term of office

223
00:19:54.720 --> 00:19:59.400
That has passed has been extremely important and we have mainly had Alice here

224
00:19:59.400 --> 00:20:05.960
Bakke as our eh pioneer so to speak in these work areas and she got

225
00:20:05.960 --> 00:20:10.039
already at the beginning of the term of office as

226
00:20:10.480 --> 00:20:14.679
main hearing on democracy and equality and anti -discrimination

227
00:20:14.679 --> 00:20:19.240
which we are very proud of the work needs to be ongoing and it needs to be

228
00:20:19.240 --> 00:20:24.720
powerful and we need to put a very strong pressure on the Commission EH

229
00:20:24.720 --> 00:20:30.000
For this is about human rights, thus to be able to work to

230
00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:34.880
able to have a job no matter who one is whether one has a disability

231
00:20:34.880 --> 00:20:39.600
or not where one comes from or whatever it may be about is about

232
00:20:39.600 --> 00:20:44.159
human rights and here we don't have to be so frightened around it

233
00:20:44.159 --> 00:20:49.080
The Swedish model because this is about a framework legislation at EU level

234
00:20:49.080 --> 00:20:52.840
that must antiden discrimination legislation to

235
00:20:52.840 --> 00:21:00.360
Examples that have been blocked since 2008 thus for 16 years it is absolutely incredible

236
00:21:00.360 --> 00:21:05.200
EH and here Alice and the environmental partners have the green group in the EU

237
00:21:05.200 --> 00:21:08.000
The last term of office worked very hard to

238
00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:13.840
The Commission should get rid of this but it is also about the fact that we cannot have

239
00:21:13.840 --> 00:21:19.520
individual countries that slow down development in the field of human rights and then

240
00:21:19.520 --> 00:21:25.559
Do we have to remove the veto in the Council of Ministers on these issues because it is absolutely incredible

241
00:21:25.559 --> 00:21:32.320
That Aban in Hungary can sit with several should be said and slow down this type of

242
00:21:32.320 --> 00:21:35.559
extremely important legislation that must come to

243
00:21:35.559 --> 00:21:41.559
eh then we need to remove the veto and we will fight hard for that eh it

244
00:21:41.559 --> 00:21:45.760
is also about this about having to know what actually happens and

245
00:21:45.760 --> 00:21:49.080
We go ahead and are very clear that we have to pick up

246
00:21:49.080 --> 00:21:54.360
Equality data We need to know what it looks like in the labor market which are the ones

247
00:21:54.360 --> 00:21:59.840
are discriminated against which ones do not get jobs which is it that not for part out of

248
00:21:59.840 --> 00:22:04.520
Salary increases We know we have a wage gap between men and women of 13 %

249
00:22:04.520 --> 00:22:09.159
that has not changed over the past 10 years it is a disaster and it must

250
00:22:09.159 --> 00:22:14.559
we do something about but then we need to know who it is and so we have to

251
00:22:14.559 --> 00:22:18.159
actually work with quotation in the environmental party The green so we are completely

252
00:22:18.159 --> 00:22:22.679
convinced that in fact, sometimes with legislation must be told

253
00:22:22.679 --> 00:22:28.840
How you want and how we want it to look like the increased gaps de ekon omis

254
00:22:28.840 --> 00:22:33.240
Increased gaps, not least in Sweden, perhaps increasing among the OECD countries

255
00:22:33.240 --> 00:22:37.600
is a challenge as well for the labor market and here one cannot then

256
00:22:37.600 --> 00:22:41.240
as the Swedish government go in and say that we remove the contribution to

257
00:22:41.240 --> 00:22:45.039
employers who have high sick pay costs that are total

258
00:22:45.039 --> 00:22:48.960
counterproductive, but we must increase the security of people at

259
00:22:48.960 --> 00:22:53.840
the labor market to be able to be retrained to be able to become employed even if one has one

260
00:22:53.840 --> 00:23:00.120
disease picture behind it that our companies should feel confident in hiring the right

261
00:23:00.120 --> 00:23:04.679
competence even though this person seeking the work has previously been

262
00:23:04.679 --> 00:23:09.840
Sick -sick, for example, then you cannot reduce the contributions to that way

263
00:23:09.840 --> 00:23:14.760
eh in some kind of ideal world create incentives for more people to come in

264
00:23:14.760 --> 00:23:19.960
work without we believe that it is totally counterproductive but basically as I said

265
00:23:19.960 --> 00:23:24.279
So I have to say that this is about human rights and fearful

266
00:23:24.279 --> 00:23:30.000
the hot around the Swedish model or speech that the EU should be v law on it

267
00:23:30.000 --> 00:23:34.320
may not be about human rights these are frame laws that need to and

268
00:23:34.320 --> 00:23:37.400
Then it is up to Sweden and the Labor Market Party to make sure that

269
00:23:37.400 --> 00:23:43.799
It will be reality thank you very much thank you also to you Magnus Eh and then

270
00:23:43.799 --> 00:23:47.360
I think I leave the word to Evin representing

271
00:23:47.360 --> 00:23:52.559
The Social Democrats were evin yes but thank you very much

272
00:23:52.559 --> 00:23:59.960
Eh good has been said Ieren, but we can start by saying that EHM EU: S

273
00:23:59.960 --> 00:24:05.840
The slogan is united in diversity EHM and this shows that the EUlands

274
00:24:05.840 --> 00:24:12.960
should really take eh diversity issues inclusive from the saw eh and

275
00:24:28.520 --> 00:24:34.000
Without it means that all EH the entire population of the European Union must

276
00:24:34.000 --> 00:24:39.520
be seen and must be included eh I have myself during this term of office

277
00:24:39.520 --> 00:24:45.520
that has gone as sitting as, among other things, in a cross -political intergroup

278
00:24:45.520 --> 00:24:53.399
and called eh anti anti -racism and diversity eh intergroup where i have

279
00:24:53.399 --> 00:24:57.320
Worked, among other things, with these eh inclusion FRR

280
00:24:57.320 --> 00:25:04.200
Ågor an eh important eh question as or an important legislation that has been raised

281
00:25:04.200 --> 00:25:10.240
As I think is worth mentioning again as like the EU should EH continue to negotiate

282
00:25:10.240 --> 00:25:13.600
around and then assume it is after all

283
00:25:29.520 --> 00:25:34.640
I think that would be a hugely important step forward to it I must too

284
00:25:34.640 --> 00:25:39.480
may also mention that I mean in the EU's eh fundamental rights statute so is

285
00:25:39.480 --> 00:25:43.720
all of course the inclusion anti -racism and everything like that is very very or

286
00:25:43.720 --> 00:25:49.720
Anti -discrimination very very clear so all of all EU's really

287
00:25:49.720 --> 00:25:57.279
Basic eh document eh rests, after all, that eh that eh the whole community should join and

288
00:25:57.279 --> 00:26:05.000
included and discrimination is not acceptable since so eh

289
00:26:05.000 --> 00:26:08.000
The Functional Law Convention

290
00:26:12.279 --> 00:26:19.919
and was one of the eh shadow reports as they are then called Social Democratic

291
00:26:19.919 --> 00:26:24.559
the group's then eh representative in the negotiations precisely about this card

292
00:26:24.559 --> 00:26:29.120
eh we also have during this term of office for as things as

293
00:26:29.120 --> 00:26:37.000
Also is positive eh with EU's first eh eh anti

294
00:26:37.000 --> 00:26:45.080
Eh what is the name of the anti -racism action plan eh in place ehm and but

295
00:26:45.080 --> 00:26:49.080
Of course there is very much left to do especially what it

296
00:26:49.080 --> 00:26:51.919
applies to go from OT to action I also fully hold

297
00:26:51.919 --> 00:26:57.799
Of course eh that representation plays role politics and representation thus

298
00:26:57.799 --> 00:27:02.200
political suggestions and representation must go hand in hand because we must after all

299
00:27:02.200 --> 00:27:06.520
ensure that all our citizens know themselves recognize themselves in

300
00:27:06.520 --> 00:27:11.960
decision makers but also in other people around EH I in the community

301
00:27:11.960 --> 00:27:18.000
Because it is also only when you feel that yes but eh can they so can I

302
00:27:18.000 --> 00:27:23.159
And there I see that there is a huge defect but partly among political

303
00:27:23.159 --> 00:27:26.960
the parties but also in society at large and the further up the hierarchy you come

304
00:27:26.960 --> 00:27:32.120
eh i i different at different workplaces the more the more

305
00:27:32.120 --> 00:27:41.200
ehm homogenic eh the most often man white hetro eh without any kind of

306
00:27:41.200 --> 00:27:45.840
function variation eh so with that said there is very much to

307
00:27:45.840 --> 00:27:49.840
do but one of the most important things comes in the coming term of term V

308
00:27:49.840 --> 00:27:54.159
would actually be to ensure one

309
00:28:00.840 --> 00:28:06.360
Big thanks also to you Evin for that then I think I give the word of course

310
00:28:06.360 --> 00:28:14.679
Also to Jesper who represents the Moderates big eh big thank you too

311
00:28:14.679 --> 00:28:20.640
for the opportunity to be with you here today eh yes but the EU should include a

312
00:28:20.640 --> 00:28:26.200
collaboration that increases idea exchange between countries eh that also spreads good

313
00:28:26.200 --> 00:28:31.360
Example reinforced exchange of experience is and and will remain

314
00:28:31.360 --> 00:28:37.159
One of the foremost forms of cooperation in the labor market and the EU should, of course

315
00:28:37.159 --> 00:28:42.640
Of course, put the majority of their power and focus on issues where intercourse

316
00:28:42.640 --> 00:28:49.880
required eh war threat and the weak competitiveness for example we

317
00:28:49.880 --> 00:28:54.039
Moderates yes but we believe that labor market policy should be designed by

318
00:28:54.039 --> 00:28:59.480
Member States themselves eh it is our way of safeguarding the Swedish model it

319
00:28:59.480 --> 00:29:04.320
also provides the opportunity to develop the same I think it is also worthwhile to

320
00:29:04.320 --> 00:29:08.360
note when I listen to this discussion that companies that are more

321
00:29:08.360 --> 00:29:15.519
Equal more inclusive also have higher profitability over time tips eh

322
00:29:15.519 --> 00:29:19.480
At the same time, I would like to emphasize that the EU should ensure that all member states

323
00:29:19.480 --> 00:29:23.600
have good protection against discrimination we moderates also think it is

324
00:29:23.600 --> 00:29:29.640
Reasonable for the Statute of Rights to be extended with certain additional rights and here

325
00:29:29.640 --> 00:29:35.120
Need the EU to ensure that every country takes responsibility for its part in that commitment

326
00:29:35.120 --> 00:29:41.080
Eh you can describe it as the floor needs to be raised and the whole toolbox

327
00:29:41.080 --> 00:29:48.279
Need to be used then there was a question in advance regarding the CSR directive eh

328
00:29:48.279 --> 00:29:53.399
And on an overall level, we are moderates positive to the CSR Directive

329
00:29:53.399 --> 00:29:57.679
We believe that it is a problem that sustainability reporting eh it is good

330
00:29:57.679 --> 00:30:00.120
that sustainability reporting becomes more

331
00:30:00.120 --> 00:30:05.080
Standardized for that has been a problem with low unable hot between

332
00:30:05.080 --> 00:30:09.399
countries and companies and there has also been very lacking in some cases

333
00:30:09.399 --> 00:30:15.519
Quality in the information that the companies leave and here I would say

334
00:30:15.519 --> 00:30:20.240
that I notice that many in business at least the part of the business community that

335
00:30:20.240 --> 00:30:24.760
Feel free to talk to politicians are positive to increased standardization on

336
00:30:24.760 --> 00:30:27.960
this area at the same time it is worth having

337
00:30:27.960 --> 00:30:32.120
In mind that this is an EU Directive that is very extensive and therefore has

338
00:30:32.120 --> 00:30:36.799
It has been important for us in the Moderates to keep us at a reasonable level for

339
00:30:36.799 --> 00:30:42.440
to safeguard the competitiveness of the companies and especially the small and medium -sized

340
00:30:42.440 --> 00:30:48.840
companies that are often under suppliers and lack these great legal

341
00:30:48.840 --> 00:30:53.799
resources that occasionally required and that is also the background to why we have

342
00:30:53.799 --> 00:30:58.880
implemented this directive at an EH minimum level

343
00:30:58.880 --> 00:31:05.039
thanks big thanks Jesper eh and now I think I leave the word to z as

344
00:31:05.039 --> 00:31:10.440
represents the Left Party please thank you very much and good morning

345
00:31:10.440 --> 00:31:18.360
From a little goaln North Tälje ehm I I work within the Left Party

346
00:31:18.360 --> 00:31:24.720
with education about anti -racism so it is very fun to be here and

347
00:31:24.720 --> 00:31:29.840
get talk about eh yes but equality and discrimination with you

348
00:31:29.840 --> 00:31:35.279
ehm today we have a rather insufficient insufficient picture of the width of

349
00:31:35.279 --> 00:31:40.399
discrimination within the Union EH Although there are guidelines from the Commission

350
00:31:40.399 --> 00:31:45.120
If equality data we still lack a common picture of perceived

351
00:31:45.120 --> 00:31:48.919
discrimination when we work for quite a few different parameters

352
00:31:48.919 --> 00:31:53.720
The Left Party EH thinks we need a clearer directive regarding

353
00:31:53.720 --> 00:31:58.600
equality data based on voluntariness he he iT and

354
00:31:58.600 --> 00:32:03.440
Especially self -identification eh A clearer directive would help countries

355
00:32:03.440 --> 00:32:08.600
Like, for example, Sweden not to be so embarrassingly bad at bringing statistics

356
00:32:08.600 --> 00:32:13.960
an allocated gender affiliation in the EH Census Register

357
00:32:13.960 --> 00:32:19.919
The Left Party wants the Swedish model with Partfinder

358
00:32:28.080 --> 00:32:33.519
trade union rights eh for others we want the EU to change procurement rules

359
00:32:33.519 --> 00:32:38.559
eh so it becomes possible to make demands on collective agreements at all public

360
00:32:38.559 --> 00:32:44.480
Procurement without exception eh in the third we want to

361
00:32:44.480 --> 00:32:49.720
Labor immigration shall be based on the salary and conditions that apply in

362
00:32:49.720 --> 00:32:54.720
Sweden or other EU countries should also apply to what immigrants we cannot

363
00:32:54.720 --> 00:32:59.080
retain this system we have now leading to pay dump and bad

364
00:32:59.080 --> 00:33:04.440
working conditions eh it only drives on segregation eh and creates great social

365
00:33:04.440 --> 00:33:11.679
and economic differences that provide racist power structures ehm that it

366
00:33:11.679 --> 00:33:16.639
structural racism is reflected in our workplaces is

367
00:33:16.639 --> 00:33:23.200
No wonder as long as we pursue on increased segregation at the same time eh like that

368
00:33:23.200 --> 00:33:28.519
We reduce this segregation, we want to see at least that labor market parties

369
00:33:28.519 --> 00:33:34.480
where both employers receive greater responsibility and trade unions more tools for

370
00:33:34.480 --> 00:33:41.039
put pressure on companies regarding equal eh action but then it is so that

371
00:33:41.039 --> 00:33:48.279
We have an ever -growing gig and platform economy with extensive many

372
00:33:48.279 --> 00:33:53.120
negatively racist workers who are completely out of backing from

373
00:33:53.120 --> 00:33:57.320
trade unions ehm and if we don't get buck on it so

374
00:33:57.320 --> 00:34:01.559
Will we not get very far that is why we want platform companies to

375
00:34:01.559 --> 00:34:05.559
regarded as employer and platform work should be regarded as

376
00:34:05.559 --> 00:34:09.320
workers to enable

377
00:34:10.720 --> 00:34:17.760
party interrogation what everyone has mentioned a bit about the ehm eh left party is positive

378
00:34:17.760 --> 00:34:22.560
to EH systems like CSR what enables companies to take responsibility for their entire

379
00:34:22.560 --> 00:34:26.960
However, value chains eh we want the requirements for companies to be raised for

380
00:34:26.960 --> 00:34:33.079
Environmental and Social Ehm Social Sustainability Ehm therefore we want

381
00:34:33.079 --> 00:34:39.760
that justice should be a more central part of CSR and that legislation should in a lot

382
00:34:39.760 --> 00:34:44.800
a greater extent apply to subcontractors therefore we also want

383
00:34:44.800 --> 00:34:51.679
that we introduce a limitation of max two stages of eh subcontractors throughout the EU

384
00:34:51.679 --> 00:34:59.720
Ehm i stop there thank you very big thanks too to you c yes as much as

385
00:34:59.720 --> 00:35:04.760
You say so much wise so much interesting eh now is that everyone should

386
00:35:04.760 --> 00:35:08.720
Get an opportunity was one of you to see as well as is something you want to comment

387
00:35:08.720 --> 00:35:12.440
as any other representative has said or perhaps something you wish to clarify

388
00:35:12.440 --> 00:35:16.359
Or as you don't have with the first round so now we run one like this a little faster

389
00:35:16.359 --> 00:35:21.000
round but everyone should have the opportunity for a few more minutes and then I do so completely

390
00:35:21.000 --> 00:35:24.920
simple that I go after my order so I give the word to abir from

391
00:35:24.920 --> 00:35:31.520
The Center Party first yes very wisely has been said and it is

392
00:35:31.520 --> 00:35:36.760
Great fun to see that there is such a commitment to the question EH but I think

393
00:35:36.760 --> 00:35:41.560
that somewhere if I am to stick to today's theme and that n I

394
00:35:41.560 --> 00:35:46.760
organizes about precisely diversity in the labor market and how to think then eh

395
00:35:46.760 --> 00:35:54.200
Work for it so there is very much thrown with concepts here as in eh

396
00:35:54.200 --> 00:35:59.000
I do not want to be the one that is that shows that one really does not

397
00:35:59.000 --> 00:36:05.640
Join this match we have then a labor market policy in Sweden that is

398
00:36:05.640 --> 00:36:11.760
Swedish and according to the EU City City, it should be the case that labor market policy

399
00:36:11.760 --> 00:36:16.319
It is a national matter and I think it is a good and good order

400
00:36:16.319 --> 00:36:21.599
It has served us well now there are then some groups that have not been allowed to join

401
00:36:21.599 --> 00:36:26.960
And where we then have in Sweden because of the Swedish labor market model but

402
00:36:26.960 --> 00:36:32.079
Also on GR of the inability of the social parties to also have inclusion and

403
00:36:32.079 --> 00:36:37.319
diversity in their negotiation rounds as a priority

404
00:36:37.319 --> 00:36:43.160
Ask eh also ended up in the aftermath and created high thresholds for people who

405
00:36:43.160 --> 00:36:49.800
Do not meet the requirements of the norm yes I just want to give an example so svia

406
00:36:49.800 --> 00:36:56.079
would hire people to Arlanda and on that on the ad they had so had

407
00:36:56.079 --> 00:37:02.640
they wrote that one of the requirements is that eh those who seek work work must be able to

408
00:37:02.640 --> 00:37:08.520
fluent Swedish in speech and writing when they then got when they got a lot

409
00:37:08.520 --> 00:37:12.640
Applications but no one really was good enough to be able to work there

410
00:37:12.640 --> 00:37:17.440
And then they got help from some diversity expert and this diversity

411
00:37:17.440 --> 00:37:23.680
The expert studied the workplace and studied the job ad and then realized

412
00:37:23.680 --> 00:37:29.400
This this consulting company that really so you don't have to have eh

413
00:37:29.400 --> 00:37:35.000
fluent and great Swedish in speech and writing to 90 % of the time as

414
00:37:35.000 --> 00:37:41.400
The people who work for Swedavia talk about language other than just Swedish so

415
00:37:41.400 --> 00:37:47.040
After all, we have an outdated an outdated way of working in recruitment what

416
00:37:47.040 --> 00:37:51.200
applies to seeing people's skills we have after all

417
00:37:51.200 --> 00:37:56.760
giant otter skills for example we we usually laugh a little but it is a

418
00:37:56.760 --> 00:38:03.400
Incredibly great finds we make we have the world's most educated

419
00:38:03.400 --> 00:38:06.400
Taxi driver training

420
00:38:27.520 --> 00:38:32.560
Both have politics with them but also the social parties I am quite critical

421
00:38:32.560 --> 00:38:37.839
against both eh eh as well as nutrition employer side and employee side

422
00:38:37.839 --> 00:38:44.440
where one does not have a conscious work on having members of their

423
00:38:44.440 --> 00:38:49.280
organizations that have a different background and actually give them space one of my

424
00:38:49.280 --> 00:38:54.319
Biggest Problem has been in politics has been that yes abir yes exactly it was

425
00:38:54.319 --> 00:38:58.400
just like this is clear we all want to join and discuss thanks so much

426
00:38:58.400 --> 00:39:02.280
And thanks for like concrete examples, I think it also helps to

427
00:39:02.280 --> 00:39:06.480
Understand the Eun level so thank you so much I apologize for interrupting but I

428
00:39:06.480 --> 00:39:09.760
Thinking everyone should catch up and comment on something and Mikaela I thought

429
00:39:09.760 --> 00:39:14.359
I leave the word to you yes but thank you very much I think it was

430
00:39:14.359 --> 00:39:18.079
very interesting and it is interesting what abir says about validation it is

431
00:39:18.079 --> 00:39:22.480
The of course incredibly important it has been pushing for a long time that one must become a lot

432
00:39:22.480 --> 00:39:27.800
much better at being able to do it eh eh and precisely in terms of

433
00:39:27.800 --> 00:39:31.640
The language then I still just want to lift into this debate now it becomes like a

434
00:39:31.640 --> 00:39:37.079
mass from above perspective on in terms of discrimination in terms of human

435
00:39:37.079 --> 00:39:41.560
rights how to treat eh people with other skin color or or

436
00:39:41.560 --> 00:39:46.440
And so on but somewhere I still want to say that here we have a

437
00:39:46.440 --> 00:39:53.040
responsibility also as parents eh as in the school eh at the municipal level thus on

438
00:39:53.040 --> 00:39:57.960
many different levels to bring in eh the right values for how to look at their

439
00:39:57.960 --> 00:40:00.319
Fellow human beings I think we also have to talk about in this

440
00:40:00.319 --> 00:40:04.200
The context so it is not just that we put on a lot of directives and how

441
00:40:04.200 --> 00:40:08.880
one is going to work so everyone would have a good way to look at

442
00:40:08.880 --> 00:40:11.920
sin on their next and on their fellow human beings so I don't think these

443
00:40:11.920 --> 00:40:16.119
the problems would be so big eh so I still really want to press it

444
00:40:16.119 --> 00:40:19.920
And you work that I myself am involved in the City of Stockholm We work after all

445
00:40:19.920 --> 00:40:25.560
hard for that in our operations that it should be inclusive in I in the municipality's

446
00:40:25.560 --> 00:40:29.599
Own businesses and that, like S, should be upwards even then eh so it wants

447
00:40:29.599 --> 00:40:33.760
I say then I think it's good that as Karin Karlsbro said that it

448
00:40:33.760 --> 00:40:38.480
Is this tool on the rule of law and that you land

449
00:40:38.480 --> 00:40:42.560
As for example, then Hungary who does not live up to human rights then

450
00:40:42.560 --> 00:40:46.800
Must one be able to pull away the eustic that still exists to such countries and

451
00:40:46.800 --> 00:40:50.760
I think that could be used to a much greater extent actually

452
00:40:50.760 --> 00:40:56.720
Thank you big thanks Mikael so very good Karin should see if Karin is with us or

453
00:40:56.720 --> 00:41:03.040
If she's on the run but I leave the word but i'm with yes well so hello yes no

454
00:41:03.040 --> 00:41:07.640
But very very wise have said when I thought maybe a few questions in order to

455
00:41:07.640 --> 00:41:12.079
You should get a clearer picture of the differences between the parties

456
00:41:12.079 --> 00:41:17.240
Also and eh that I started with so the Liberals are a very European friend LT

457
00:41:17.240 --> 00:41:21.920
party because we believe we need stronger cooperation on all the issues there

458
00:41:21.920 --> 00:41:26.839
We have to solve common problems or where we need to guard the joint

459
00:41:26.839 --> 00:41:32.040
Right is we are we are so positive about the EUSAM work so we want Sweden

460
00:41:32.040 --> 00:41:38.960
shall change the crown with the euro for example eh but labor market policy is after all is

461
00:41:38.960 --> 00:41:44.680
After all, it is national and we also guard the Swedish model but

462
00:41:44.680 --> 00:41:50.880
At the same time, we are challenged by eh new business models new new

463
00:41:50.880 --> 00:41:55.200
forms of employment, so to speak and then I think of gigg work and there have

464
00:41:55.200 --> 00:42:00.880
EU now eh worked out this as one calls

465
00:42:11.200 --> 00:42:14.200
platform doors

466
00:42:15.800 --> 00:42:22.240
Text about it and and so and it shows that we live in a global economy and

467
00:42:22.240 --> 00:42:28.079
Also, a European labor market has at the same time as the digitalisers regen eh

468
00:42:28.079 --> 00:42:33.559
challenges us in a whole new way so that you have to be able to EH also find new ones

469
00:42:33.559 --> 00:42:38.160
new regulations that, to solve the problems you want to access it is a late

470
00:42:38.160 --> 00:42:41.800
A question that I get quite often in these contexts it is about

471
00:42:41.800 --> 00:42:46.319
quotation and then I was just thinking of telling us we are from the Liberals' side

472
00:42:46.319 --> 00:42:49.880
very committed to gender equality issues and have always been

473
00:42:49.880 --> 00:42:54.680
And here is the question that we have because it is also a matter of equality but

474
00:42:54.680 --> 00:42:58.880
It is also a matter of growth for Europe that we cannot afford that so many

475
00:42:58.880 --> 00:43:03.760
Women in Europe do not fully participate in the labor market and that is because of the fact that

476
00:43:03.760 --> 00:43:08.440
Man in the Member States has legislation such as joint taxation you have

477
00:43:08.440 --> 00:43:12.800
a family policy that does not make it profitable for women and work and we

478
00:43:12.800 --> 00:43:16.480
usually go as far as we say that but for the EU sake for Europe's sake we have

479
00:43:16.480 --> 00:43:21.280
not advice then eh to have the best of the world and the world's well -educated eh as well

480
00:43:21.280 --> 00:43:25.720
housewives because eh this is, after all, affects everyone's economy and it is

481
00:43:25.720 --> 00:43:29.760
Also one it is a right is called fair question of gender equality so that

482
00:43:29.760 --> 00:43:33.880
There is and here we need to work together in the Union to eh

483
00:43:33.880 --> 00:43:40.119
strengthen women's eh labor market and gender equality in the labor market eh and

484
00:43:40.119 --> 00:43:43.079
Then you usually get the question as a letter on the post what do you think about

485
00:43:43.079 --> 00:43:49.000
Quotation to corporate boards it is a hot issue and here has the Liberals

486
00:43:49.000 --> 00:43:54.720
landed in the fact that we are we think it is a bad idea with quotation to

487
00:43:54.720 --> 00:43:59.160
Board of Directors without we have to find other seats but yes these issues

488
00:43:59.160 --> 00:44:05.000
If you are often wrestled in when talking about this kind of eh of questions so

489
00:44:05.000 --> 00:44:09.720
that yes I just wanted to clarify some points where we often get questions I

490
00:44:09.720 --> 00:44:15.200
Stay there thanks great thanks Karin Eh for that eh

491
00:44:15.200 --> 00:44:19.680
Magnus I thought the word is going to you now yes but thanks so much no but it is

492
00:44:19.680 --> 00:44:23.760
many things that have been said here and that are important to lift up I believe and not

493
00:44:23.760 --> 00:44:29.440
At least that CS RD Directive is completely deciding and where we are with our green

494
00:44:29.440 --> 00:44:34.079
main hearing on precisely that one should be able to increase the requirements of reporting social

495
00:44:34.079 --> 00:44:37.680
human rights and diversity issues but this needs

496
00:44:37.680 --> 00:44:42.160
Go further this applies to companies with 500 employees and a turnover of 40

497
00:44:42.160 --> 00:44:47.640
Million euro eh there are thus very few companies actually that end up here

498
00:44:47.640 --> 00:44:53.119
And we believe that the companies that may be at the forefront that can report that they

499
00:44:53.119 --> 00:44:57.760
are sustainable will also win in the future because we will set

500
00:44:57.760 --> 00:45:02.359
requirements for public procurement, for example, we already have many companies that

501
00:45:02.359 --> 00:45:06.680
themselves set demands in their procurement of subcontractors and need to get in

502
00:45:06.680 --> 00:45:12.200
This type of reports then of course needs smaller companies one

503
00:45:12.200 --> 00:45:17.319
Support in this accounting and it is quite obvious eh it is so that when

504
00:45:17.319 --> 00:45:22.160
one talks about these things to happen at eunal level the parties that often talk about

505
00:45:22.160 --> 00:45:28.200
That the EU should be more decent, so you are happy to talk about what we war in Europe and we

506
00:45:28.200 --> 00:45:32.800
have to work together toward Russia we have a problem with

507
00:45:32.800 --> 00:45:37.079
competitiveness in Europe and we have to work together with it but you mention

508
00:45:37.079 --> 00:45:41.280
thus not human rights in the same sense it is a problem

509
00:45:41.280 --> 00:45:47.200
Human rights are one of the foundations that the EU was built at one time

510
00:45:47.200 --> 00:45:53.079
In time we have to keep up and when we take frame laws at euns level

511
00:45:53.079 --> 00:45:58.400
Human rights will affect Swedish labor market policy and

512
00:45:58.400 --> 00:46:02.200
It should affect Swedish labor market policy it is up to

513
00:46:02.200 --> 00:46:06.640
The parties make sure it happens eh and if it does not happen then it must come

514
00:46:06.640 --> 00:46:12.520
Pressures from the EU It is entirely in order and then it is again that

515
00:46:12.520 --> 00:46:18.240
We need to have a zero tolerance against racism we need a directive a legislation

516
00:46:18.240 --> 00:46:23.280
which is clear and that must not be slowed down by individual countries in the Council of Ministers and

517
00:46:23.280 --> 00:46:28.319
We need a powerful eub budget that actually spends money on civil society

518
00:46:28.319 --> 00:46:32.559
and the organizations that are fighting for human rights as well on

519
00:46:32.559 --> 00:46:37.640
The labor market please yes thank you so much for that too

520
00:46:37.640 --> 00:46:45.760
Magnus I leave the Word to Evin here NO NO but also to make

521
00:46:45.760 --> 00:46:49.760
a little difference between things that have been said by different people from

522
00:46:49.760 --> 00:46:53.520
Of course, different parties are so that we are of course as Social Democrats

523
00:46:53.520 --> 00:46:59.319
Even with the fact that labor market issues are of course mainly a national

524
00:46:59.319 --> 00:47:03.920
Ask but this is not about EH just about labor market issues it

525
00:47:03.920 --> 00:47:08.440
is about securing access to the labor market for when it comes

526
00:47:08.440 --> 00:47:13.599
To wage formation and everything like that and eh, of course the EU should not hold on

527
00:47:13.599 --> 00:47:17.760
and poke in our contract module

528
00:47:26.960 --> 00:47:33.720
So this will be eh even if it goes into labor market issues so it will be

529
00:47:33.720 --> 00:47:39.319
Ju a matter of fundamental rights ehm the secure of fundamental

530
00:47:39.319 --> 00:47:43.800
Rights and then you have to think broadly it is about women and men

531
00:47:43.800 --> 00:47:49.880
of course it is about eh hbtq people it is about people with

532
00:47:49.880 --> 00:47:54.480
Functional Variation This is about people who are outside born outside

533
00:47:54.480 --> 00:47:59.920
Sweden and EU borders Eh or or people with as me that is a bit

534
00:47:59.920 --> 00:48:07.559
slightly darker eh tone eh in skin tone ehm so we really have to address also

535
00:48:07.559 --> 00:48:14.359
the question eh broadly to ensure that the EH Eh Eh's slogan on

536
00:48:14.359 --> 00:48:20.160
real eh realize so it not only becomes word eh and not just on some

537
00:48:20.160 --> 00:48:24.839
Areas EH thus the labor market area is hugely important but we get with us

538
00:48:24.839 --> 00:48:30.640
that it is usually related to also eh lack of inclusion and actually eh

539
00:48:30.640 --> 00:48:36.240
racism and discrimination on in other parts of society eh there are they eh

540
00:48:36.240 --> 00:48:41.079
In our society that does not even want to go and visit the social services because one knows

541
00:48:41.079 --> 00:48:44.760
to go there, you are already dead in advance and you will not get it

542
00:48:44.760 --> 00:48:50.520
the help eh as when you want to have or you are not believed at that help

543
00:48:50.520 --> 00:48:55.720
that one would not as you would need because you have bad experiences or

544
00:48:55.720 --> 00:49:02.000
other person with the same background eh as one's self has bad experiences eh with

545
00:49:02.000 --> 00:49:06.040
The education system is hugely important so we really need a large

546
00:49:06.040 --> 00:49:12.040
grip eh about inclusion and anti -discrimination in all parts of

547
00:49:12.040 --> 00:49:15.319
the community for that is actually related to just

548
00:49:15.319 --> 00:49:21.040
eh discrimination in the labor market but as I said you need

549
00:49:21.040 --> 00:49:26.799
just distinguish the labor market our labor market model

550
00:49:26.799 --> 00:49:32.480
the eh with just eh precisely anti -discrimination and diversity issues

551
00:49:32.480 --> 00:49:38.079
eh because this is actually basically about fundamental free and

552
00:49:38.079 --> 00:49:43.440
rights thanks so much evin too those for the clarifications eh then we have

553
00:49:43.440 --> 00:49:47.520
Jesper next in turn

554
00:49:47.640 --> 00:49:53.119
Jesper we shall use the intergovernmental European cooperation to

555
00:49:53.119 --> 00:50:00.280
Sweden should be able to be more freer safer and richer but there seems to be a picture

556
00:50:00.280 --> 00:50:05.559
in many that it will become reality by the fact that the entire EU must become eh exactly

557
00:50:05.559 --> 00:50:11.160
As Sweden and otherwise member states, in principle, EH should be sent out of the Union

558
00:50:11.160 --> 00:50:15.920
And here I find it important to have the perspective that the EU can work

559
00:50:15.920 --> 00:50:21.440
purposefully constructive and long -term to persuade member states that

560
00:50:21.440 --> 00:50:25.920
really meet the minimum requirements for human rights it is through

561
00:50:25.920 --> 00:50:33.000
This continuous work eh in processing these countries inside the Union

562
00:50:33.000 --> 00:50:39.559
as we can make sure that Jews in Hungary Roma in Romania women in Poland get a

563
00:50:39.559 --> 00:50:45.760
better or at least a decent eh life situation and it is difficult to

564
00:50:45.760 --> 00:50:51.760
Write it on a Vala Fish like a slogan eh but this is this continuous

565
00:50:51.760 --> 00:50:57.480
the work of raising the floor and using the toolbox within the Union it is as

566
00:50:57.480 --> 00:51:02.839
We can get a working union to feel eh pride

567
00:51:02.839 --> 00:51:10.040
because yes thank you so much Jesper and eh last but not least in this round so

568
00:51:10.040 --> 00:51:15.680
I leave the word to the Zi Left Party please thank you very much eh and I want to

569
00:51:15.680 --> 00:51:20.680
just say that there have been a lot of wise eh input here so I will actually

570
00:51:20.680 --> 00:51:23.280
keep me pretty brief i want to say that it is very wise of what

571
00:51:23.280 --> 00:51:27.760
becomes in descriptions of the Swedish labor market and that all parties

572
00:51:27.760 --> 00:51:32.319
characterized by a slightly outdated way of thinking I would like to see more people in

573
00:51:32.319 --> 00:51:38.280
Companies municipalities regions trade unions that work actively with education in

574
00:51:38.280 --> 00:51:43.520
discrimination but specifically eh anti -racism as i do in the left party

575
00:51:43.520 --> 00:51:49.240
eh then I want to clarify that the Left Party is also against

576
00:51:49.240 --> 00:51:54.280
Low -wage country The Swedish model in games and further stagnate salary development

577
00:51:54.280 --> 00:52:00.359
eh over time and increase eh i stay there please

578
00:52:00.359 --> 00:52:06.760
very big thank you to yes corner i would part i can say i would wish

579
00:52:06.760 --> 00:52:11.280
that we had all day on us and talk about these important perspectives to hear

580
00:52:11.280 --> 00:52:15.000
also even more from the representatives of the different parties about how to look at

581
00:52:15.000 --> 00:52:19.359
perspectives diversity and inclusion in the EU but it is noticed in any case that you all

582
00:52:19.359 --> 00:52:24.400
are incredibly engaged which I think is very very important we want to

583
00:52:24.400 --> 00:52:29.599
Those who represent us in us yes Sweden in the European Parliament they drive

584
00:52:29.599 --> 00:52:34.119
Here the questions we think that in ie charter is very important eh and before I leave

585
00:52:34.119 --> 00:52:39.640
Over the word to Anna who will round this Friday's knowledge so I want

586

596
00:53:29.920 --> 00:53:33.079
Like this foundation it is the human rights we like

597

After all, under the EU Commission and we are, as I said, we do not take any party but we
