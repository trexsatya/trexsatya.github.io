1
00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:59.360
I have the jacket full of broth.

2
00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:08.280
Want to see my broth now?

3
00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:11.840
It's broth everything.

4
00:01:55.760 --> 00:02:01.280
In that book you can learn how to navigate your inner countryscape.

5
00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:11.800
You can have a dedicated copy, if you like.
 I do it special for you.

6
00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:24.360
It would have come yesterday.

7
00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:27.920
Oops...

8
00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:34.720
- Should I throw it there?
 - We must try ... Absolutely.

9
00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:46.160
No, this should not happen.
 Absolutely.

10
00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:53.400
Sure.
 I have the whole order here in front of me.
 In the computer, but ...

11
00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:59.440
What had you ordered?

12
00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:07.200
It's a bit sad.
 They have put me on a project with Tord now.

13
00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:14.680
No, I should not say idiot.
 But he's a little after ...

14
00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:20.600
He is sluggish in some way, and as I said ... he does not smell roses.

15
00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:28.600
If you think you have had garbage standing in the apartment ...

16
00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:35.560
Yes!
 Old milk that has been in the sun and buzzed - just so Tord smells.

17
00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:40.760
But you have to fight.
 It is good.
 Thanks.
 Hello.

18
00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:46.640
Okay, Tord ... where were we?

19
00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:56.240
God, what he is looking.

20
00:03:56.400 --> 00:04:03.160
He thinks I'm a photo model.
 Everyone thinks I'm a photo model.

21
00:04:03.320 --> 00:04:09.320
"Hello! Okay, I look like a photo model, but I'm not."

22
00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:12.640
Cranky, right?

23
00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:23.640
It's the same thing.
 Real models do not look like models privately.

24
00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:29.440
They just look like photo models when they have a lot of makeup, but I then ...

25
00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:36.880
I swear, I have no makeup at all.
 I still look like a photo model.

26
00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:42.480
But you ... you couldn't work as a photo model ...

27
00:04:42.640 --> 00:04:48.440
If you look at my neck - it's long and slim.
 But your neck ...

28
00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:52.080
It is more compact.

29
00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:58.400
- Yeah, though I haven't thought ... - did you know what?
 I gotta go.

30
00:04:58.560 --> 00:05:03.280
I'll meet Natalie.

31
00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:07.400
Take, da.

32
00:05:07.560 --> 00:05:10.080
La, La!

33
00:05:20.920 --> 00:05:25.160
-Damn!
 This job, then ... - what?

34
00:05:25.320 --> 00:05:30.080
I think you feel so exposed.

35
00:06:17.200 --> 00:06:20.200
Home - Sweet Home.

36
00:06:23.360 --> 00:06:28.240
- Do you have a home computer?
 - Yes, I have a computer.

37
00:06:28.400 --> 00:06:34.240
Have you connected it to this worldwide intranet?

38
00:06:34.400 --> 00:06:38.520
- Interior, yes.
 - Of course it's fantastic ...

39
00:06:38.680 --> 00:06:44.960
I'm going to New York.
 I sent an electric letter to the travel agency:

40
00:06:45.120 --> 00:06:49.240
"Hello. I want to travel every now and then."
 So it was clear.

41
00:06:49.400 --> 00:06:54.880
- Giant practical.
 -Certainly.
 This with data is getting big!

42
00:06:55.040 --> 00:07:01.680
You can put everything possible on data.
 Pen and paper are soon passé.

43
00:07:01.840 --> 00:07:06.000
Computerization has been going on for a long time now ...

44
00:07:06.160 --> 00:07:11.960
- You have also joined the internet?
 -Joined?
 I email and so ...

45
00:07:12.120 --> 00:07:16.920
After all, we can start sending electric mail to each other.

46
00:07:17.080 --> 00:07:22.440
You can send message on the mobile phone as well.

47
00:07:22.600 --> 00:07:28.240
- A voice message?
 - No, text ... do you have a mobile phone?

48
00:07:28.400 --> 00:07:33.640
I am writing to you - a little message ...

49
00:07:33.800 --> 00:07:39.400
- Is that morse alphabet?
 - No, it's usual text.

50
00:07:39.560 --> 00:07:45.320
"Hello!"
 Now I send it, and you can read it on your mobile.

51
00:07:51.440 --> 00:07:55.440
Where do you mean I can see this now?

52
00:07:55.600 --> 00:08:02.880
- You may have a slightly newer model.
 - It goes so fast now with everything.

53
00:08:11.480 --> 00:08:18.200
Can you be a little quieter!
 There are those who have a ten -point stent tomorrow.

54
00:08:52.480 --> 00:08:57.960
- Do you think this is a microphone?
 -No.

55
00:08:58.120 --> 00:09:01.960
Why are you talking in it, then?

56
00:09:07.480 --> 00:09:10.480
Hello!

57
00:09:11.680 --> 00:09:15.680
God how fun!

58
00:09:16.200 --> 00:09:21.880
-Welcome.
 -Thanks.
 Now we will stay here together!

59
00:09:22.040 --> 00:09:25.960
-Yes finally.
 - It's a third, huh?

60
00:09:26.120 --> 00:09:31.600
- No, it's a second.
 -Okay.
 I thought it was a third.

61
00:09:31.760 --> 00:09:37.480
- You thought so.
 - The most important thing is that we live together.

62
00:09:37.640 --> 00:09:40.400
Yes indeed.

63
00:09:40.560 --> 00:09:46.640
Well, you have it like this ... you like to have it like this ... plot rich.

64
00:09:46.800 --> 00:09:49.800
Well, I do.

65
00:09:49.960 --> 00:09:56.240
Yes, think ... The taste is like the butt - split!

66
00:09:56.400 --> 00:09:59.840
- But you, Lotta ... - Linda.

67
00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:06.320
God, sorry!
 I'm so stupid.
 Wind.
 Pax for this room.

68
00:10:06.480 --> 00:10:12.240
I already live here.
 I have done really well for you in the living room.

69
00:10:12.400 --> 00:10:17.080
No, I'm going to live here.

70
00:10:19.600 --> 00:10:24.560
But, God ... Oh, Fy!
 Shit, what a disgusting aunt!

71
00:10:24.720 --> 00:10:28.560
She has no hair.
 I'll remove it.

72
00:10:28.720 --> 00:10:33.920
No, it's my mom.
 She died of cancer last year.

73
00:10:34.080 --> 00:10:42.320
Ugh then.
 But you ... in that case it is well on time that you forget her.

74
00:10:42.480 --> 00:10:47.400
- Yes, that's it.
 - Gum!

75
00:10:52.240 --> 00:10:56.200
- Ta, then ... –la, la!

76
00:11:00.520 --> 00:11:06.640
I also think you should have equal pay.
 It's not that...

77
00:11:06.800 --> 00:11:11.480
Still, I think men should be men.

78
00:11:11.640 --> 00:11:17.440
I don't want to come home and find my guy who beds or something.

79
00:11:17.600 --> 00:11:22.040
We are different in nature.
 We are.

80
00:11:22.200 --> 00:11:27.600
But that doesn't stop me from driving a car for example.

81
00:11:32.560 --> 00:11:36.360
I have never been to New York.

82
00:11:36.520 --> 00:11:41.880
I'm going to go up in the Statue of Liberty, the World Trade Center and ...

83
00:11:42.040 --> 00:11:46.120
After all, the World Trade Center has collapsed.

84
00:11:46.280 --> 00:11:50.160
Huh?
 What the hell are you saying?

85
00:11:50.320 --> 00:11:55.960
- The tower have collapsed!
 -Yes.
 Do not you know that?

86
00:11:56.120 --> 00:12:00.840
What in ... How did it go?

87
00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:05.760
Some terrorists flew straight into the towers.

88
00:12:05.920 --> 00:12:11.160
Is it true?!
 How the hell can I have missed it?

89
00:12:11.320 --> 00:12:16.640
- Yes, it's a bit strange.
 - Her god, it's a great thing.

90
00:12:16.800 --> 00:12:23.160
That they don't take it up in the media!
 It can have consequences for ...

91
00:12:25.520 --> 00:12:31.360
- It has been quite a lot of talk.
 - But I look at the news ...

92
00:12:31.520 --> 00:12:35.520
But you are a little drowsy forward nine.

93
00:12:35.680 --> 00:12:41.320
I must have nodded ... I still think I'm hanging out.

94
00:12:41.480 --> 00:12:47.200
- What should we do this weekend?
 –Wa?
 I was going to go a round golf ...

95
00:12:47.360 --> 00:12:53.120
I asked for help with the summer tires and then you were so stiff in the back ...

96
00:12:53.280 --> 00:12:57.320
But now it's better, actually ...

97
00:13:02.840 --> 00:13:08.040
Great - Stina sat on Gärsgårn and the rods came and look '

98
00:13:08.200 --> 00:13:13.640
  Big - Stina got pissed and screamed: Have you never seen a yard?
 Hello!

99
00:13:13.800 --> 00:13:18.680
-Hello.
 - Don't you see it's an overall party?

100
00:13:18.840 --> 00:13:23.960
  So we eventually lean ... Don't extinguish!

101
00:13:31.960 --> 00:13:35.960
-Bowl!
 - bowl on you, Per - Arne!

102
00:13:40.440 --> 00:13:44.360
You had mixed it well, Carita.

103
00:13:44.520 --> 00:13:50.160
Do you think?
 I think it tastes a bit strange.

104
00:13:50.320 --> 00:13:53.880
Do you think so?

105
00:13:54.040 --> 00:13:57.760
Yes, when you say so, so ...

106
00:13:57.920 --> 00:14:03.560
- But isn't it more like an odor?
 -Yes it is.

107
00:14:03.720 --> 00:14:08.560
But what in the name of the Lord is what smells?

108
00:14:10.480 --> 00:14:15.720
Carita, you know what I'm sitting here thinking about ...

109
00:14:15.880 --> 00:14:21.680
I wonder how long since it was we really managed hygiene?

110
00:14:26.840 --> 00:14:32.640
This is what is allowed to stand back when there is a lot with other things.

111
00:14:32.800 --> 00:14:38.800
It is as true as it is said.
 One cannot catch everything in the world

112
00:14:38.960 --> 00:14:41.960
I mean it.

113
00:14:47.480 --> 00:14:51.160
Yes...

114
00:15:04.760 --> 00:15:09.800
Why has Astrid Lindgren not received the Nobel Prize ...

115
00:15:09.960 --> 00:15:15.480
As much as she has done for all children!
 Who had I been today-

116
00:15:15.640 --> 00:15:22.640
- If I didn't fall asleep to Emil, Alfons, Pippi and all the fairy tale characters?

117
00:15:25.240 --> 00:15:30.560
This customer meeting we would arrange ...

118
00:15:30.720 --> 00:15:36.120
Can't we keep it a little easy?
 We go out to the Japanese SPA: ET–

119
00:15:36.280 --> 00:15:39.880
–And we have a meeting during the day and party in the evening ...

120
00:15:40.040 --> 00:15:45.760
The problem with that proposal, Tord, is that it is ... bad.

121
00:15:47.080 --> 00:15:50.120
- Giant!
 -Okay.

122
00:15:50.280 --> 00:15:56.080
We do this instead: Review in the office, we go to the theater ...

123
00:15:56.240 --> 00:16:01.560
... and then we end with a good dinner out in town.

124
00:16:01.720 --> 00:16:06.920
Wait a little, I'll just make a note.

125
00:16:07.840 --> 00:16:11.840
-Today's date?
 - The 24th.

126
00:16:12.520 --> 00:16:20.920
"Dear Diary! Today I heard the stupid suggestion I ever heard!"

127
00:16:21.080 --> 00:16:27.160
"Colleague Paul, as I mentioned before, surpassed himself in stupidity."

128
00:16:28.760 --> 00:16:34.360
"Good God, give me the power to stand out with his stupidity and his bad smell"

129
00:16:35.320 --> 00:16:38.360
Sorry, where were we?

130
00:16:45.320 --> 00:16:51.760
-How is it?
 You seem a little low.
 - Robban's mother was visiting.

131
00:16:51.920 --> 00:16:58.240
She has a fucking need for control!
 I do not decide in my own apartment.

132
00:16:58.400 --> 00:17:03.880
-I'm going crazy!
 What should I do?
 - Such there is hard.

133
00:17:04.040 --> 00:17:11.680
There is a plant called Spik -Club.
 Take 100-125 seeds from it.

134
00:17:11.840 --> 00:17:19.440
You cook a strong chili, and put on plates in the kitchen.

135
00:17:19.600 --> 00:17:25.920
You sprinkle in the seeds in her plate and black pepper on the others.

136
00:17:26.080 --> 00:17:32.720
Then she dies guaranteed.
 Much safer than putting someone performing a staircase ...

137
00:17:38.240 --> 00:17:43.840
Or you can just try to explain to her what you feel ...

138
00:18:02.360 --> 00:18:05.480
I have a fox in a box.

139
00:18:20.640 --> 00:18:25.120
How would you say human being get happy?

140
00:18:26.680 --> 00:18:32.120
You have to find your inner Landscape and Learn How To Navigate It.

141
00:18:32.280 --> 00:18:38.480
Then you will be able to experience positive energy and also spread it.

142
00:18:38.640 --> 00:18:43.560
Because Happiness is in the Universe.

143
00:18:49.960 --> 00:18:53.920
You are the universe.

144
00:18:54.080 --> 00:18:58.920
I'm just a little tired and weird.

145
00:18:59.080 --> 00:19:02.480
"Universe" ...

146
00:19:13.880 --> 00:19:18.800
Time flies!
 Next month we celebrate a wooden wedding.

147
00:19:18.960 --> 00:19:23.960
- How much is a wooden wedding?
 - Five wonderful years.

148
00:19:24.120 --> 00:19:29.440
We are in our seventh now.
 What is it called?

149
00:19:29.600 --> 00:19:32.600
Ash...

150
00:19:32.760 --> 00:19:35.960
Dung!

151
00:19:36.120 --> 00:19:42.120
No, it's been great years.
 There you have something to look forward to.

152
00:19:42.280 --> 00:19:46.680
- You have just met.
 - Sex months.

153
00:19:46.840 --> 00:19:52.600
- It only gets better over the years.
 - The relationship deepens.

154
00:19:52.760 --> 00:19:57.640
You get to know each other ... as you didn't do in the beginning ...

155
00:19:57.800 --> 00:20:03.120
You get very close to each other.

156
00:20:03.280 --> 00:20:07.280
- More bread?
 -It is good.

157
00:20:07.440 --> 00:20:11.360
More bread?
 Hello...

158
00:20:11.520 --> 00:20:17.600
This community is very important in the relationship.
 I usually say that ...

159
00:20:17.760 --> 00:20:24.280
Kristina and I are not just married.
 She is one of my better friends.

160
00:20:24.440 --> 00:20:31.080
A relationship becomes what we do.
 We have to take the time for each other.

161
00:20:31.240 --> 00:20:36.880
- Dare to be a little spontaneous ... - and not plan to death everyday life.

162
00:20:37.040 --> 00:20:43.040
Maybe take time off for some weekend, leave the kids, go to some spa or so ...

163
00:20:43.200 --> 00:20:48.600
Just a flower or a friendly word means a lot.

164
00:20:48.760 --> 00:20:52.880
It must not be a slentrian.

165
00:20:53.040 --> 00:20:59.000
It is true that when you have ... it is easy to take someone for granted ...

166
00:20:59.160 --> 00:21:04.360
... when you have seen a person every day for decades ...

167
00:21:04.520 --> 00:21:08.920
That we dare to be spontaneous ...

168
00:21:09.080 --> 00:21:14.280
As I usually say "we keep the flame alive" ...

169
00:21:14.440 --> 00:21:18.480
Curiosity is the best spice.

170
00:21:18.640 --> 00:21:24.240
Do you only have that spark ... then the whole relationship matures, huh?

171
00:21:24.400 --> 00:21:29.800
- Lite as a nice wine ... - or an old cheese.

172
00:21:29.960 --> 00:21:34.160
- Yeah ... - yeah ... yeah!

173
00:21:34.320 --> 00:21:37.320
OH!

174
00:21:42.800 --> 00:21:48.240
-Coffee?
 - Yes, it wouldn't have been so stupid.

175
00:21:56.040 --> 00:22:03.320
- Now it is enough ... My eczema is burning.
 - Now you are clean and smell good.

176
00:22:03.480 --> 00:22:07.800
Then it's your turn, Carita.

177
00:22:07.960 --> 00:22:12.760
No, it's expensive drops, this.

178
00:22:12.920 --> 00:22:20.600
I've been thinking about one thing, Per -Arne.
 Why is there so much evil?

179
00:22:20.760 --> 00:22:24.120
Yes, say that ...

180
00:22:25.400 --> 00:22:30.240
When a man lives in exclusion ...

181
00:22:30.400 --> 00:22:36.200
... beyond all glory and fairness, dirty and dan ...

182
00:22:36.360 --> 00:22:42.400
- Then she becomes an evil person.
 - So you mean I'm evil?

183
00:22:42.560 --> 00:22:49.160
–Wa?
 No.
 I thought of Hitler.
 - Well, the ...

184
00:22:53.040 --> 00:22:58.560
Yes, this is what it looks like.
 Nice neighbors are too.

185
00:22:58.720 --> 00:23:04.360
I usually sleep here, but you can sleep wherever you want.

186
00:23:05.880 --> 00:23:10.120
-I will take it.
 -Nice.

187
00:23:12.640 --> 00:23:19.040
Talk to lower case letters about this.
 I must not rent out in the second place.

188
00:23:19.200 --> 00:23:22.200
-Obvious!
 -You understand...

189
00:23:23.320 --> 00:23:29.440
Good good.
 You can take the macaroni.
 See you the day after tomorrow.
 The keys.
 Hello!

190
00:23:35.920 --> 00:23:38.960
Oh!
 Cozy ...

191
00:23:47.280 --> 00:23:52.240
I don't think we can be together anymore.

192
00:23:52.400 --> 00:23:56.920
Do you want to break up?
 Why?

193
00:24:00.240 --> 00:24:06.360
Frida, I've worked too much.
 It has not been so good lately.

194
00:24:07.640 --> 00:24:13.360
- You must be able to talk about it.
 - It's not about it.

195
00:24:14.120 --> 00:24:18.520
- Have you met someone else?
 -No!

196
00:24:18.680 --> 00:24:21.880
What is it then?

197
00:24:22.040 --> 00:24:26.040
Magnus, you have too little penis.

198
00:24:27.760 --> 00:24:34.040
- Do you end up for my penis?
 - Yes, I tried.
 It does not work.

199
00:24:34.200 --> 00:24:41.200
You said the size has no significance ... Is it too short, right?

200
00:24:41.880 --> 00:24:45.640
Partly that, and so it is too narrow.

201
00:24:45.800 --> 00:24:51.520
- Helt absurd!
 What is it really?
 - You have too little penis.

202
00:24:51.680 --> 00:24:57.240
There is nothing wrong with my penis.
 I have a completely normal, Swedish penis.

203
00:24:57.400 --> 00:25:02.800
Magnus, your penis is three centimeters in erected state!

204
00:25:02.960 --> 00:25:07.200
Excuse me ... that's not true.
 You know that.

205
00:25:07.360 --> 00:25:12.720
- We have measured it!
 -Yes.
 It was probably four centimeters.

206
00:25:12.880 --> 00:25:17.720
-Often!
 - Okay, but it's still small.

207
00:25:17.880 --> 00:25:23.560
- Many people have less than that.
 - It would be a squirrel then.

208
00:25:25.040 --> 00:25:30.760
Okay.
 It may be a little smaller than the average, but ...

209
00:25:31.760 --> 00:25:37.920
This with penis enlargement ... if I work overtime and sell the car -

210
00:25:38.080 --> 00:25:45.040
- So maybe I can afford to go to the US and operate myself.
 Do you want that?

211
00:25:47.000 --> 00:25:52.400
-What do you want?
 - If you want to, I do.

212
00:25:52.560 --> 00:25:57.520
Do you really want to do it for me?

213
00:25:57.680 --> 00:26:03.080
- How long will it be?
 - It gets eight to nine centimeters.

214
00:26:03.240 --> 00:26:07.240
-I love you.
 -I love you too.

215
00:26:20.280 --> 00:26:22.680
Yes.

216
00:26:22.840 --> 00:26:26.640
Paul ...

217
00:26:28.080 --> 00:26:33.280
This is your conscience that speaks.

218
00:26:36.680 --> 00:26:41.360
You talk too much.

219
00:26:41.520 --> 00:26:44.840
You do away with it.

220
00:26:45.000 --> 00:26:49.400
Your wife thinks you're embarrassing ...

221
00:26:54.520 --> 00:27:00.080
- Yes, this is what it looks like.
 -It is really pretty.
 Big and nice.

222
00:27:00.240 --> 00:27:05.640
Here I sleep, but you don't have to.

223
00:27:05.800 --> 00:27:10.080
- This is what are we taking it?
 -Absolutely!

224
00:27:10.240 --> 00:27:18.200
But be very tense ... It is not on the inner list to rent out in the third place.

225
00:27:18.360 --> 00:27:23.600
- Of course ... it was eight, huh?
 -Yes.

226
00:27:24.400 --> 00:27:28.880
-So.
 - And so the keys.

227
00:27:29.040 --> 00:27:34.040
Then we will see you tonight.
 Bye.

228
00:27:34.760 --> 00:27:41.800
--Wow, that's huge.
 - Here we can take place both.

229
00:28:12.880 --> 00:28:16.880
SVT Program texting: Lisbet Olofsdotter - Arvidsson

230
00:28:18.520 --> 00:28:26.680
Stop buying those hip -hop discs that you still don't like.

231
00:28:28.560 --> 00:28:33.680
- You don't get cool anyway.
 -No...
