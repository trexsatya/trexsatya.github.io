1
00:00:00,100 --> 00:00:03,800
- I recognize a real rack kid when I see one.
 - No problem.

2
00:00:05,720 --> 00:00:09,440
I'm going to take revenge because he made Harry so scared.

3
00:00:18,100 --> 00:00:21,060
Hello Hello!

4
00:00:21,140 --> 00:00:25,840
- We're outside ... - Green Lund!

5
00:00:25,980 --> 00:00:30,420
It's Halloween in there, and Hussein is with us.

6
00:00:30,420 --> 00:00:40,140
Do you remember when we tested costumes?
 There were a lot of people who wanted to see Hussein in his suit, so good.

7
00:00:40,140 --> 00:00:45,040
- Should I try this one?
 - What do you think?
 What do you think?
 What do you think?

8
00:00:45,040 --> 00:00:52,400
- Yes.
 Not now, but in there.
 - Walk around and scare people with it.

9
00:00:52,580 --> 00:00:58,540
- I don't think it's so scary.
 - It's great fun, will look good when running.

10
00:00:58,540 --> 00:01:01,140
Yes indeed.
 It will look fun.

11
00:01:01,140 --> 00:01:05,860
But, we have heard that Gröna Lund should be very scary this year.

12
00:01:05,860 --> 00:01:13,360
More horror houses, more ghosts, more witches, more attractions that are open.
 Here we go!

13
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:15,000
- Yes, now we drive!
 - Yay!

14
00:01:15,180 --> 00:01:18,980
Check out what a large spider, Harry.

15
00:01:23,240 --> 00:01:27,120
Hussein went to the toilet.

16
00:01:27,460 --> 00:01:31,000
- Are you peppy to see him, right?
 - What you jump.

17
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:34,240
Aaah!
 Hahaha!

18
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:46,380
- Should I walk around with this one?
 - Absolutely!
 It is absolutely amazing.
 Wait, I have to film.

19
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:50,180
It's so fun!

20
00:01:50,180 --> 00:01:55,840
It is a huge.
 And just that you sit like this on it ... your feet just ...

21
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:02,080
- Welcome!
 Do you want to have a piece of candy?
 - No, you must not eat sweets.

22
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:05,040
- Do you also want a candy piece?
 - Yes.

23
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:07,500
Hope they taste.

24
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:10,860
- It's a cheat day.
 - Yes.

25
00:02:10,860 --> 00:02:14,400
Check out Alma.
 Should we split?

26
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:20,440
- It's married!
 You can't eat that.
 - Oh my God!
 No no no.

27
00:02:27,320 --> 00:02:30,320
Just get in.

28
00:02:37,100 --> 00:02:39,380
I can not take it...

29
00:02:39,380 --> 00:02:44,700
- The legs below.
 You must have your legs underneath.
 - Well, sorry.

30
00:02:45,820 --> 00:02:49,120
I have pain in my legs.

31
00:02:49,740 --> 00:02:55,260
We are not stuck.
 You have to down with your legs.

32
00:02:56,280 --> 00:03:00,220
It is only the baby that is stuck.

33
00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:13,240
It is a special show today so there are no queues, but I still did not get a seat on this ride.

34
00:03:32,220 --> 00:03:38,320
- Now we will switch to the big area.
 - I've taken off my suit.

35
00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:45,280
- You can't walk in horror houses with a baby.
 It's not possible.
 - No, especially when sitting on your shoulders.

36
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:49,800
- What is it, Harry?
 - Up there!

37
00:03:49,820 --> 00:03:54,020
Oh yeah, the lousy pumpkin.

38
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:57,980
Hello then, please the page.

39
00:03:57,980 --> 00:04:06,420
Just right.
 Now we go through the portal to the slightly more unpleasant, scary side.

40
00:04:06,420 --> 00:04:08,840
Mo ha ha ha ha!

41
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:11,300
Are these scary?

42
00:04:11,500 --> 00:04:14,120
No, it can't move.

43
00:04:17,820 --> 00:04:22,220
Come came, my little ones ...

44
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:24,080
Stop.

45
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:30,140
Do you see over there on a big stage?
 There, the new horror attraction is the sect.

46
00:04:30,140 --> 00:04:34,360
It is the scariest thing they have here at Gröna Lund.

47
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:36,560
- Should we go there?
 - Yes.

48
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:42,200
- I'm just kidding!
 We should not go there.
 - It's really scary and brand new.

49
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:49,660
It is a 13-year limit, 11 years of adult, although it is a recommendation.
 If you dare, you can go in.

50
00:04:49,660 --> 00:04:52,500
- Do you dare, Alma?
 - No.

51
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:55,700
- Neither do I.
 - You don't have to.

52
00:04:55,700 --> 00:04:57,680
I dare to go in.

53
00:04:57,760 --> 00:05:03,880
It will be me, Axel and Hussein who then test the sect then.

54
00:05:03,880 --> 00:05:05,620
Clearly.

55
00:05:05,620 --> 00:05:10,000
- We'll find a babysitter for you, maybe.
 - Yes.

56
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:15,240
I know who - the two witches that followed us last year.

57
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:19,860
- Yes exactly.
 - Just that, the one who dropped his nose.

58
00:05:19,860 --> 00:05:22,200
They are coming soon.

59
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:27,280
- Oh, here it's a fire show.
 - Do you remember that token?

60
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:29,000
I get scared!

61
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:31,640
- Are you scared?
 - mm.

62
00:05:31,640 --> 00:05:37,700
- Why is that?
 - It is scary.

63
00:05:42,980 --> 00:05:47,620
- What do you think?
 - Eeeh ...

64
00:05:47,700 --> 00:05:51,140
Okay, weird.

65
00:05:58,840 --> 00:06:02,000
Behind you!

66
00:06:06,420 --> 00:06:10,760
Look at the teeth.
 Oh, what scary teeth!

67
00:06:10,760 --> 00:06:12,760
LOL!

68
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:18,100
- Run!
 - There is no danger, there is no danger.

69
00:06:18,180 --> 00:06:28,060
He is just an ordinary person with makeup, loose teeth and red lentils that make his eyes red.

70
00:06:30,100 --> 00:06:35,480
How quiet you are.
 Are you not happy?

71
00:06:36,380 --> 00:06:40,700
I who want happy people here at my circus.

72
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:46,760
I recognize a real rack kid when I see one.

73
00:06:52,520 --> 00:06:58,240
- Mom, maybe you should check behind you.
 - Oh!

74
00:07:04,220 --> 00:07:06,620
Come, Alma.

75
00:07:06,860 --> 00:07:09,560
Did it fall asleep?

76
00:07:09,700 --> 00:07:13,140
- Do you want to shake hands with it?
 - No.

77
00:07:13,140 --> 00:07:16,400
- May I do it?
 - Yes.

78
00:07:16,520 --> 00:07:22,780
Harry, come.
 He is really sweet.
 Check out, he's kind.

79
00:07:22,920 --> 00:07:25,840
Shake hands.

80
00:07:25,960 --> 00:07:30,880
How brave you are!
 Cool, friend!

81
00:07:31,220 --> 00:07:35,140
Check ... what a scary.

82
00:07:36,180 --> 00:07:39,800
- It wasn't so dangerous, Harry.
 - No.

83
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:44,640
- It was pretty kind.
 - It was the one who scared you so much last year.

84
00:07:44,640 --> 00:07:46,140
Yes.

85
00:07:46,280 --> 00:07:50,460
Why so urgent?
 Shouldn't we greet a little?

86
00:07:50,460 --> 00:07:55,480
Look, here we have someone who thinks she's safe behind the camera.
 As wrong as you can have.

87
00:07:55,480 --> 00:08:01,140
- Who are you?
 - I'll take care of you this stay.
 Where are we going?

88
00:08:01,140 --> 00:08:04,320
I don't know, you can suggest.

89
00:08:04,320 --> 00:08:12,360
In that case, I think in there, the sect.
 There is a nice cemetery with a coffin you can warm up in, huh?

90
00:08:12,440 --> 00:08:16,060
I'd rather not warm myself in a coffin.

91
00:08:16,060 --> 00:08:23,020
You have no choice if you go in there.
 Then you have renounced all rights to your own decisions.

92
00:08:23,020 --> 00:08:26,620
- Joanna, don't trust him.
 - No, I don't trust him.

93
00:08:26,640 --> 00:08:32,480
- It feels like there are more scary beings in the park this year.
 - Yes indeed.

94
00:08:32,480 --> 00:08:39,020
Now we make a break from the horror and go the wild mouse instead.

95
00:08:39,020 --> 00:08:41,700
Come on, Harry.

96
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:51,120
This is good.

97
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:03,260
We will go off!
 Aaah!

98
00:09:14,020 --> 00:09:19,080
There was some scary type over there.
 What did he say?

99
00:09:19,140 --> 00:09:24,420
He told me I would rest in a coffin, so Harry doesn't like him.

100
00:09:24,420 --> 00:09:26,440
Can we go now?

101
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:31,040
- Where are we going?
 - The witches are coming.

102
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:34,880
Well, oh.
 Yes, there we have one.

103
00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:37,780
Check.

104
00:09:37,780 --> 00:09:41,080
Aaahahaha!

105
00:09:41,160 --> 00:09:46,600
In here, the clowns are doing - thus, the actors.

106
00:09:46,660 --> 00:09:52,020
We should go in "Behind the scenes" - that is, behind the secret door - and check out.

107
00:09:52,020 --> 00:09:57,440
Here is the door, turn around.
 Super -exciting!

108
00:09:57,440 --> 00:10:04,680
- Will we meet some clowns?
 - No, we will not meet any scary type now.
 Check!

109
00:10:09,560 --> 00:10:15,140
Here there are creepy clown suits, and so it says the clowns' name.

110
00:10:15,180 --> 00:10:19,360
Here is one that Alma could have.

111
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:23,620
- Isn't it too big?
 - Yes, but it will be quite fun.

112
00:10:23,620 --> 00:10:28,440
- Here is one that Harry could have.
 - Yes, it's like the Joker.

113
00:10:28,460 --> 00:10:32,860
- You can wear all the clothes underneath.
 Do you want to test them?
 - Yes.

114
00:10:32,860 --> 00:10:37,760
- The green has given permission, I not only came to this.
 - Should you make up like the joker?

115
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:43,860
Yes, you can also make up if you go up the stairs.

116
00:10:48,840 --> 00:10:51,640
- Welcome.
 - Thanks.

117
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:59,620
- Is it possibly you who will be scary clowns?
 - Yes.
 Alma and I.

118
00:10:59,840 --> 00:11:01,540
All right!

119
00:11:01,740 --> 00:11:05,060
- I would have to take off the hat, is that okay?
 - mm.

120
00:11:05,260 --> 00:11:10,820
- I'll paint a little white first, on my face.
 - mm.

121
00:11:27,300 --> 00:11:29,500
So, how lousy?

122
00:11:29,500 --> 00:11:36,260
This will be the revenge of the children against all ghosts, circus directors and clowns who scared them in the park.

123
00:11:36,260 --> 00:11:39,300
Thanks, Grönan, for this.
 Great!

124
00:11:41,220 --> 00:11:43,180
Drive!

125
00:11:43,560 --> 00:11:46,640
- Aaah!
 - Aaaaaaah!

126
00:11:47,860 --> 00:11:51,120
- Scare him, he's scared.
 - Aah!

127
00:11:51,940 --> 00:11:59,160
Now I will scare the circus director.
 I'm going to take revenge because he made Harry so scared.

128
00:12:06,660 --> 00:12:09,920
What kind of horrible creatures?!

129
00:12:17,500 --> 00:12:21,980
- It has become dark, and it's been time.
 - Yes.

130
00:12:22,080 --> 00:12:24,140
- The sect.
 - The sect.

131
00:12:24,140 --> 00:12:29,040
Now we drive, we three.
 The children are and go with an employee.

132
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:34,820
- No, but I run the wild mouse instead.
 - No no no!
 Come now.

133
00:12:35,080 --> 00:12:39,340
- This one will be scary.
 - It's much, much scary than last year.

134
00:12:39,340 --> 00:12:42,180
Yes!
 It is not possible to compare.
 It is not possible to compare.

135
00:13:04,360 --> 00:13:08,280
No God, that is a real man.

136
00:13:10,620 --> 00:13:12,340
HELP ME!

137
00:13:12,340 --> 00:13:14,740
Help me!
 Help me!

138
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:18,800
Over there.

139
00:13:42,380 --> 00:13:46,860
We stand outside the entrance again, Gröna Lund has closed.

140
00:13:46,860 --> 00:13:50,880
It was only open for two hours today.
 What do you think?

141
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:54,140
- Fun.
 - Great fun, and scary.

142
00:13:54,140 --> 00:13:56,940
- Scary!
 - So scary.

143
00:13:56,940 --> 00:14:01,700
It was so scary this year!
 I don't know if it comes out in what we have filmed, but it was so ...

144
00:14:01,700 --> 00:14:06,480
- Not for me.
 No one scared me.
 - No?

145
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:11,340
Before you got this and started scaring others, wasn't it scary then?

146
00:14:11,340 --> 00:14:15,580
- I scared people twice.
 - Yes.

147
00:14:15,580 --> 00:14:19,900
- But you also got scared.
 - You got a little scared too, huh?

148
00:14:19,900 --> 00:14:21,020
Yes.

149
00:14:21,020 --> 00:14:26,480
- The circus director was the worst.
 - Yes, he was.
 He was definitely the worst.

150
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:32,540
I thought we should take a question of today, which we have taken before, but it comes every week from several people.

151
00:14:32,540 --> 00:14:38,260
And it is: "Where is Hussein?", "What does Hussein do?", "Where does Hussein live?".

152
00:14:38,260 --> 00:14:44,800
Okay, what should I say now ... I'm plugging.
 I don't live with The Swedish Family anymore.

153
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:49,480
- Hussein has moved away from home, become an adult.
 - Yes exactly.

154
00:14:49,480 --> 00:14:52,220
Mom, why did he live with us?

155
00:14:52,220 --> 00:14:59,540
I needed a home, I was homeless.
 I found you - or, you found me - I got to stay with you.

156
00:14:59,540 --> 00:15:03,480
- I'm so happy we found you.
 - Yes, we really are.

157
00:15:03,480 --> 00:15:05,140
I also.

158
00:15:05,140 --> 00:15:10,940
It is not even possible to describe - when Alma and Harry saw Hussein, run towards him, jump up and ...

159
00:15:10,940 --> 00:15:17,740
- Alma just "he's my brother", from the first day.
 - super cozy.
 You have really been like siblings.

160
00:15:17,800 --> 00:15:24,300
You who like me and are interested in what I do can follow my Instagram down here.

161
00:15:24,300 --> 00:15:28,480
