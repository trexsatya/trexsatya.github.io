How to sell your home without a broker - 7 steps.

2
00:00:04,320 --> 00:00:06,640
1. Evaluate the home.

3
00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:10,440
Check out what similar housing in the same area has been sold for-

4
00:00:10,520 --> 00:00:13,840
-Or ask some brokers to make a free valuation.

5
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:18,480
You can also hire a valuation person.
 However, it costs money.

6
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:21,160
2. Make a sales ad.

7
00:00:21,240 --> 00:00:24,120
Try to formulate you as a real broker.

8
00:00:24,200 --> 00:00:26,640
Add nice pictures to the home.

9
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:30,680
Ask family and friends to spread your ad on social media-

10
00:00:30,760 --> 00:00:33,000
-And post on standalone sites.

11
00:00:33,080 --> 00:00:37,600
As a private person, you cannot post an ad on Hemnet.

12
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:40,600
3. Perform an inspection.

13
00:00:40,680 --> 00:00:43,800
Normally, it is the buyer who inspects the home.

14
00:00:43,880 --> 00:00:47,160
If you carry out an inspection before the sale-

15
00:00:47,240 --> 00:00:51,840
-Keeps the buyer safer and hopefully want to make a higher bid.

16
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:54,120
4. Arrange view.

17
00:00:54,200 --> 00:00:57,320
Make the home ready to be shown.

18
00:00:57,400 --> 00:01:00,200
Keep in mind that more than one show may be required.

19
00:01:00,280 --> 00:01:03,760
Don't miss out on contact details to speculator-

20
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:06,640
-So that you can contact me after the show.

21
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:08,520
5. Bidding.

22
00:01:08,600 --> 00:01:12,360
Contact the speculators and hear if anyone wants to place a bid.

23
00:01:12,440 --> 00:01:15,240
Keep them updated on bids coming in.

24
00:01:15,320 --> 00:01:19,880
You decide to whom you want to sell and what price you accept.

25
00:01:19,960 --> 00:01:23,560
6. Check the buyer's finances.

26
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:27,280
Ask to see proof that the buyer has the funding clear-

27
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:29,800
-or to see a loan promise.

28
00:01:29,880 --> 00:01:33,240
7. Write purchase agreements.

29
00:01:33,320 --> 00:01:37,680
To exit the sale, you must design a purchase agreement-

30
00:01:37,760 --> 00:01:40,480
-When both you and the buyer write on.

31
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:43,160
There are templates online to use.

32
00:01:43,240 --> 00:01:46,320
Take the help of a lawyer if you feel unsure.
