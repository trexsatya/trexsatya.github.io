00:00:05,205 --> 00:00:11,580
Hi, Elza here from Elza's bookshelf.
 It's time for spring's last video before I take summer holidays,

2
00:00:11,580 --> 00:00:16,270
So I was going to summarize the reading for Juni month.

3
00:00:16,270 --> 00:00:21,513
It was a perfectly okay month, of which the top three is really top three.

4
00:00:22,053 --> 00:00:25,428
I got a positive surprise.

5
00:00:25,467 --> 00:00:35,000
I can tick off some things on my book challenges.
 Over all very good months.

6
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:43,292
So that's why I think we start with, before I say hello then and explain a little how I think before the summer,

7
00:00:43,292 --> 00:00:47,000
So I think we start by talking about the books I have read in June.

8
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:51,580
And of course I start with the one I liked at least and end with the one I like best.

9
00:00:51,580 --> 00:00:56,000
And let's start with the one I liked at least, that was the world literature.

10
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:01,464
I went to India and read Visny's death by Manil Suri.

11
00:01:01,464 --> 00:01:13,334
This is some kind of philosophical, touch of magical realism.
 We are in Bombay, I think, in an apartment building.

12
00:01:13,334 --> 00:01:23,409
There is a person like Vishnu, his name is Vishnu.
 He lives in the staircase and helps those as residents.

13
00:01:23,409 --> 00:01:27,815
He is of a low burden.

14
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:33,147
And then he or something, he is dying on the stairs.

15
00:01:33,147 --> 00:01:38,462
While lies there for death, in the middle of the stairs more or less,

16
00:01:38,462 --> 00:01:44,000
So a lot of drama happens around people living in the staircase.

17
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,031
And that is different perspectives.

18
00:01:46,031 --> 00:01:59,737
And you can also join Vishnus, in the midst of his dying.
 Flashbacks to his life, to his childhood, to his first love.

19
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:08,605
Even a little Indian mythology is there and we get to learn some gods and so on.

20
00:02:08,605 --> 00:02:13,000
This sounds like a perfect book for me, because I like when it's a little magical realism.

21
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:22,000
It may be a touch of philosophy and such.
 But it doesn't reach me.
 I don't think this is good at all.

22
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:28,862
Just because this magical realism as a writer is trying to tackle, does not work.
 It just gets ..

23
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Strange instead.
 There is no flow, there will be no good transitions.

24
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:40,000
The characters also feel ..

25
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Not credible.
 Because I get like this, wait, what happened now?
 Why did he do that?
 Why is he doing so there?
 There is a lot that just hangs in the air.

26
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:51,690
I gave it the second.

27
00:02:52,721 --> 00:02:59,031
It's a dust of book, so I can check it.
 It's a world literature so I can tick it off.

28
00:02:59,031 --> 00:03:04,545
But it is also such a book that I have included in the list of 10 books I will read in 2023.

29
00:03:04,545 --> 00:03:07,000
That way it is nice that I can tick off this book.

30
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:13,757
Then I want to talk about months of random.
 For those who have seen the reading logo

31
00:03:13,757 --> 00:03:21,000
So every month I let in chance choose a book.
 The book that was chosen for June I dnf-adoled.

32
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:24,516
I couldn't read it, I couldn't handle it.

33
00:03:24,516 --> 00:03:35,847
So I took a new one in the Reading Log I choose a new one.
 And then there were secrets at Sea View Cottage.

34
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:40,761
Yes, Emily Gunnis, Sea View Cottage.

35
00:03:43,142 --> 00:03:51,000
I had not had it for so long in the bookshelf or in my TBR on goodreads.
 But this one was really good, short just relative.

36
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:56,708
We are allowed to accompany a mother

37
00:03:56,708 --> 00:04:00,612
Who disappears with his newborn baby.
 You have to look for her.

38
00:04:00,612 --> 00:04:04,000
At the same time, it is also a journalist who starts digging into this.

39
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:10,199
And these stories, while all looking for this mother and baby

40
00:04:10,199 --> 00:04:17,871
So you also find out some historical background to things.
 And these two stories are intertwined then.

41
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,844
Very good.

42
00:04:19,844 --> 00:04:22,078
I really liked this book incredibly much.

43
00:04:22,078 --> 00:04:25,257
Positively suprised.
 I went into it and said I wanted to take this one.

44
00:04:25,257 --> 00:04:30,808
I had no high expectations but I didn't think it would be as dark as it actually was.

45
00:04:30,808 --> 00:04:34,000
It is very dark, it takes up fairly difficult subjects.

46
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:42,471
And a little mystery there, a little twists and turns.
 I liked it very much.
 I gave it 3.5 I think.

47
00:04:42,471 --> 00:04:45,982
It was quick to read or listen to in this case.

48
00:04:46,989 --> 00:04:56,031
And I was curious about the author.
 So I think I gave it 3.5 close to 4 anyway.
 Because it was a little too short too.

49
00:04:56,031 --> 00:05:02,022
But I'm not going to talk so much more about it.
 I link the reading logo where I talk and you can accompany me in my thoughts

50
00:05:02,022 --> 00:05:06,000
Down here in the description so you can, if you want, look at it.

51
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:09,409
So here we have another book that I talk about.
 It is also this very good book but

52
00:05:09,409 --> 00:05:14,000
Also, this book I will talk so much about because it is in one of my reading.

53
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:22,000
This, I'm talking more than you'll know by Katie Gutierrez, I think she pronounces it.

54
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:28,868
And this book is in this book challenge what I try to get through all the books that are nominated in,

55
00:05:28,868 --> 00:05:34,000
What is it, Goodreads Choice Award in the category Mystery Thriller.

56
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:38,364
I'm not going to talk so much about it.
 This is about a woman

57
00:05:38,364 --> 00:05:46,000
who have two men.
 One day, one of the man finds out that she is married to two men and kills the other man.

58
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:50,219
And then it's a blogger, journalist who is digging in this and yes,

59
00:05:50,219 --> 00:05:55,000
Things happen then.
 I'm not going to talk so much about it, I liked it.

60
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:59,612
This one was not short, this one is normal length, 13 hours approximately.

61
00:05:59,612 --> 00:06:03,282
I'm not going to talk so much about it, I liked it very well.

62
00:06:03,282 --> 00:06:07,600
It was an interesting perspective but it went up and down.
 My reading went up and down, it's not even but

63
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:09,000
Over all I like it.

64
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:15,000
I also link that reading logo down in the description then you can, if you are curious about my thoughts you can look at it there.

65
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:19,795
By the way I would say that the kids down there are over there

66
00:06:19,795 --> 00:06:26,034
So that you heard my background, apologize.
 But so it is, I did not find otherwise, found no time to record.

67
00:06:26,034 --> 00:06:30,101
Okay, the next book.
 The years of Annie Eernux.

68
00:06:30,101 --> 00:06:38,000
This is one, this book, during the summer we had to choose an optional book to read in the book circle and I chose the years.

69
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:41,967
I liked this book, while I also didn't like it.

70
00:06:41,967 --> 00:06:46,902
It is skillfully written, here is the next autobiographical.

71
00:06:46,902 --> 00:06:53,143
Annie writes for a whole lifetime as well,

72
00:06:53,143 --> 00:07:01,183
So she goes through various historical events in both individual perspective and collectively.

73
00:07:01,417 --> 00:07:06,734
That's how.
 Very difficult to explain this book, but I liked it.
 I really did.

74
00:07:06,734 --> 00:07:10,576
While I was also measured.

75
00:07:10,576 --> 00:07:15,422
Because it is, I was quickly measured even though it is not so thick.

76
00:07:15,422 --> 00:07:18,429
I think I gave this one four, three and a half four like that.

77
00:07:18,429 --> 00:07:23,511
And I am a hugety pike at Annie.
 I understand

78
00:07:23,511 --> 00:07:32,165
That she is a skilled writer, extremely good and I like her take on things.

79
00:07:32,165 --> 00:07:37,549
Telling a whole life in this way is very fascinating.

80
00:07:37,549 --> 00:07:43,000
Both me and no, but I'm glad I read Nobel Laureates, so I can say.

81
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:54,000
Then we have another pond of book, one that has been really dusty.
 I think I've had this book since 2015-2016.
 2015 it must have been.

82
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:57,462
Yes, 2015. I'm talking about Game of Thrones.

83
00:07:57,462 --> 00:08:01,882
Here is the first book called Game of Thrones.
 The series is called

84
00:08:01,882 --> 00:08:05,000
A Song of Ice and Fire and the first book is called Game of Thrones.

85
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:15,000
And I've listened to it.
 33 hours.
 Over 33 hours was this one.
 But God, what a good thing this was.

86
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:23,000
Unfortunately, I remember a lot from the TV series, because I have seen the TV series and I like the TV series very well, but I remember too much.

87
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:33,000
But it also feels fun that some things differ from the TV series, so it will be like I discover this world again in some parts.

88
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:43,685
Four, strong four, what an adventure.
 I am doing book number two called A Clash of Kings.

89
00:08:43,685 --> 00:08:47,000
I have this series to get through.

90
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:52,000
It went much faster than I thought, because I can't stop listening.
 I have fit constantly.

91
00:08:52,000 --> 00:09:00,000
That's the worst adventure.
 Incredibly interesting characters.
 It is well written too.
 And so damn interesting only.

92
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:11,000
How intrigue it is and everyone wants the iron throne.
 It is dragons and magic, but at the same time it is just pure politics as well.

93
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:14,000
This book has everything.
 I thought this one was really really good.

94
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:21,000
Then I got a surprise item not so long ago.
 It was a book that I have really been looking forward to reading.

95
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:31,000
Everything else had to wait.
 I jumped on this at once.
 I talk about the snake salt of Johan Rundberg who is the fifth part in Månvind and Hoff.

96
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:43,000
Mika and Constable Hoff are good partners in crime, I intend to say.
 They solve crime for Hoff is a police officer.

97
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:52,000
We are in Sweden.
 It is the 19th century.
 Mika lives in orphanages.
 Things happen.

98
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:57,000
The two help and solve cases.
 So, so good.

99
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:08,000
This one was just as good, but what I like about the book is that they are dark and that the author Johan trusts his readers.

100
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:16,000
Because it is still 9-12 years.
 Trust their readers, let them take hard topics and can handle it.

101
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:21,000
He does it in a good way.
 He writes it in a good way.
 Strong four, of course.

102
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:30,000
And then we have one to dust off.
 This is not just a dust off, but it bends in some.

103
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:36,000
This year was the year I would read Dona Tartt.
 I own three Dona Tartt.

104
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:45,000
I posted a picture of the three books on Instagram and let you vote which Dona Tartt I would start with.

105
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:52,000
And the secret story won.
 I'm super happy about it because I was most craving for this one.

106
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:58,000
We have to come along ... This is probably such a storytelling style.
 That narrator is Richard.
 I think he uses something.

107
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:05,000
Richard Pap may be a pronounced it.
 He starts at a prestigious college.
 Hangs with the elites there.

108
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:11,000
But everything is not right with these elites.
 It's a lot like ... Yes.

109
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:17,000
Then you have to keep up with this gang anyway.
 When they find some shenanigans.

110
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:24,112
It is dark.
 It's so sick.
 Well written.

111
00:11:24,112 --> 00:11:33,364
Very thick.
 Over 700 pages.
 I swallow this one because it is incredibly character pity.

112
00:11:33,364 --> 00:11:43,000
And the character is ... they may not be ... I don't like them.
 I don't sympathize with them.
 But I'm fascinated by them.

113
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:53,000
I want to know more.
 Tartt has a way to explore man's innermost darkness in such a skillfully good way.

114
00:11:53,000 --> 00:12:03,761
This was better than I thought it would be.
 I had high expectations.
 Be really nervous.

115
00:12:05,210 --> 00:12:10,605
But wow.
 I swallow this book.
 It's very thick.

116
00:12:10,605 --> 00:12:16,031
I wish I had it in another.
 I wish I had the black cover.

117
00:12:17,185 --> 00:12:25,000
This one is good looking.
 I do not complain.
 The black is a little better.
 Mysterious.
 I can't explain more than this one is so good.

118
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:31,000
It deserves the hype it has.
 I'm glad I can check it now.
 Now I can tick off the dust off.

119
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:39,000
And a Donna Tartt book that I said I would read.
 A strong four.
 Yes, a strong four.

120
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:49,000
My absolute favorite this year.
 This month.
 I have to say that it was a book that took me by surprise.

121
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:54,000
I was so surprised.
 I did not have very high expectations.
 I had no expectations at all.

122
00:12:54,000 --> 00:13:01,000
I thought I would like to read it here, it's a dusted AV book, the classic.
 I'm hungry and curious.

123
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:08,000
I had read another book by him and liked it very much.
 I thought I have it at home.

124
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:17,000
Animal Farm by George Orwell.
 Listen.
 Listen what masterpiece this is.

125
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:28,000
This is the satire's satire.
 It is incredibly smart, incredibly skillfully written and so damn spot on.

126
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:34,000
Okay, we're on a farm.
 The animals do revolt against the humans.

127
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:42,000
This is about barley and pigs and horses that make revolt.

128
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:54,000
This is a satire.
 This should make Narra how light power can corruption, how easily it can corrupt power.

129
00:13:54,000 --> 00:14:06,000
How things, how it all started so well.
 The animals should only support ourselves.
 We know how it will be late to a dictator.

130
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:15,000
Very written, incredibly well written.
 I am so impressed and it was much easier to understand and read than I thought it was.

131
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:22,000
I liked this much more than 1984, which I liked.
 I liked in 1984, but this one is so damn good.

132
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:30,000
There is a new translation and that was the one I listened to.
 So I didn't read it and I listened to it.

133
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:39,000
Wow.
 I just say wow.
 Now I want to know more about George Orwell.
 Now I am very curious about him.

134
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:48,000
He is well sharp, incredibly good at putting words into things that I find difficult to describe myself.

135
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:59,000
Very happy that I can dust off this.
 Now I want to know everything about George Orwell.
 Who is he?
 How did he think?
 Who is he?
 What happened?

136
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:07,000
That's how.
 There we have the books that I have been able to read during Juni month, which you hear.
 I am very peppy and recommend many of them.

137
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,605
Except for a book, Vishnus' death.

138
00:15:09,605 --> 00:15:14,000
You know what?
 Are you not interested?
 Don't read it.
 Do you think it sounds interesting?
 Test it.

139
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,469
But I was not so impressed.

140
00:15:16,469 --> 00:15:23,000
The rest of these books I have read this month have been absolutely fantastic and I recommend them, which you heard.

141
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:31,000
Then we got it clarified.
 Now I'm going to take summer vacation.
 I'll be back at the beginning of September sometime.
 But I probably won't be completely gone.

142
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:36,420
Because I will do some reading blogs.
 I have chosen ..

143
00:15:36,837 --> 00:15:43,306
Random has selected a book for July.
 Romanov.
 I thought I would do a reading logo.

144
00:15:43,306 --> 00:15:47,703
I had planned that anyway.
 Then we have August left too.

145
00:15:47,703 --> 00:15:52,183
I might come back in the form of reading vlogs a little now and then.
 But I don't know when.
 I do not know how.

146
00:15:52,183 --> 00:15:54,426
I can't promise I do.

147
00:15:54,426 --> 00:16:00,158
But who knows.
 Then I have another thing to tell and that is that I have started to make subtitles for my videos.

148
00:16:00,158 --> 00:16:06,833
I have tried.
 I have found a great program where you upload a video and it generates the text.

149
00:16:06,833 --> 00:16:10,208
But you have to check and read and look.

150
00:16:10,208 --> 00:16:22,000
Which makes it take a long time.
 So to all the language police out there.
 Take a deep breath.
 Have you done it?
 Take one more.

151
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:31,000
And turn off the subtitles if you disturb it.
 Because I can't guarantee it's 100% right.
 Because I can't cope.
 It's so very funny.

152
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:39,000
I don't have that time.
 But I still want there to be an alternative that I can give.
 For those who want it.

153
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:44,138
So I will try to do.
 I will prioritize my wrap ups.

154
00:16:44,138 --> 00:16:49,158
So these videos there where I tell you what books I have read during the month.

155
00:16:49,158 --> 00:16:53,348
Because it is the ones who have the most views.
 These are the ones that are popular.
 So then I think it

156
00:16:53,348 --> 00:16:57,288
Is good to be able to provide that service if you say so.
 So they will prioritize.

157
00:16:57,288 --> 00:17:04,000
But as I said.
 It won't be perfect.
 There will be some knots.
 I apologize.
 But there is so much pill and job.

158
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:07,275
But if you see something crunchy, I say so to and I'll try to fix it.

159
00:17:07,275 --> 00:17:10,257
Then you know it too.
 I try to.
 I fight with subtitles.

160
00:17:10,257 --> 00:17:14,000
When I get done.
 Who knows.
 But I'm trying.
 I try to.

161
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:19,790
Now.
 Now I have told you what books I have learned and liked in June.

162
00:17:19,790 --> 00:17:21,790
I have also talked about my subtitles.

163
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:29,000
Adventure Experiment I am doing.
 And then I have told me that I take summer holidays now.

164
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:35,000
But maybe come back in the form of reading vlogs.
 Who knows.

165
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:43,000
I want to say nice summer to you.
 So we will hear in September.
 And take it easy out there.
 Farewell.
 See you.
 Bye!
