Hello and welcome back to a new video

2
00:00:03.328 --> 00:00:08.192
Today Lilly and I will tell you a bit how it goes with exams at KTH

3
00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:18.135
It is because the academic year is divided into four periods

4
00:00:18.176 --> 00:00:25.610
And after each period you have an exam period where you then have time to plug in for your exams and even write them

5
00:00:26.112 --> 00:00:28.910
But the exams don't just have to be written

6
00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:30.756
There are also oral exams

7
00:00:30.756 --> 00:00:34.048
For example, I had an oral exam now in one of my courses

8
00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:37.805
And besides that, I know that many programs,

9
00:00:37.805 --> 00:00:38.672
or some anyway,

10
00:00:38.672 --> 00:00:41.931
have project work or submissions instead

11
00:00:42.190 --> 00:00:45.281
It is common on architecture, where they have no exams at all

12
00:00:45.568 --> 00:00:48.526
And also other programs that have group work instead

13
00:00:49.152 --> 00:00:51.456
But how is it really done on an exam

14
00:00:52.047 --> 00:00:53.145
Good question

15
00:00:53.145 --> 00:00:55.330
I had a written exam

16
00:00:55.552 --> 00:00:57.856
And I think it's very similar to the college exam

17
00:00:58.188 --> 00:01:00.447
One starts with identification control

18
00:01:00.717 --> 00:01:04.376
You have to show ID or passport for the exams and then you get admitted

19
00:01:04.376 --> 00:01:07.172
And then you get to put jackets and bags beside

20
00:01:07.172 --> 00:01:11.340
Then you go to your designated place, or sometimes you are lucky and can choose a place yourself

21
00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:14.616
And then paper is already placed on the table

22
00:01:14.752 --> 00:01:16.703
And then you start writing the exam

23
00:01:17.658 --> 00:01:20.419
What one can bring with you, except for the usual as a pencil and blur

24
00:01:20.419 --> 00:01:24.247
Is that you can bring pencul, pen sharpener, food and drink

25
00:01:24.247 --> 00:01:27.980
Which can be good as the exams usually get quite long

26
00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:31.458
And then it is important to have energy to cope through the entire exam

27
00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:37.305
Besides that, after a while, the teacher usually enters the classroom even

28
00:01:37.305 --> 00:01:41.080
And then you get a great opportunity to ask questions if you do not understand the questions

29
00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:43.900
If you need to get some more clarity about the

30
00:01:44.192 --> 00:01:46.752
And it is basically how a written exam looks

31
00:01:46.752 --> 00:01:51.247
Last but not least we also have

32
00:01:51.247 --> 00:01:52.582
A little later inlet

33
00:01:52.582 --> 00:01:54.954
Which is 30 minutes after the exam has started

34
00:01:54.954 --> 00:01:58.709
If one happens to come late or have been sleeping off

35
00:01:58.979 --> 00:01:59.752
Perfect

36
00:02:01.734 --> 00:02:03.939
How did you plug in for your exam

37
00:02:05.032 --> 00:02:06.250
A little different

38
00:02:06.347 --> 00:02:08.512
I think it's very

39
00:02:08.512 --> 00:02:11.845
One is very favored by sitting with your course friends

40
00:02:11.948 --> 00:02:15.278
And discuss and learn and each other

41
00:02:15.278 --> 00:02:20.381
Then you get much better understanding too for what one should be able to

42
00:02:20.381 --> 00:02:23.003
Then it is also sometimes nice to sit yourself

43
00:02:23.003 --> 00:02:26.667
Then maybe you are sitting in some silent hall in the library

44
00:02:27.124 --> 00:02:29.055
And really caves down on all questions

45
00:02:29.248 --> 00:02:33.600
But then there is also a lot recorded on Youtube and so

46
00:02:33.856 --> 00:02:35.904
As exercises and lectures

47
00:02:36.402 --> 00:02:38.385
It is above all in math courses

48
00:02:38.385 --> 00:02:45.279
So there is a lot of material if you feel that you may not have learned enough from the lectures or in the course book

49
00:02:45.888 --> 00:02:47.154
So it will probably go well

50
00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:52.578
Yeah there was a bit about exams at KTH

51
00:02:52.578 --> 00:02:55.104
It's a little different maybe

52
00:02:55.104 --> 00:02:56.575
A little different from high school anyway

53
00:02:56.896 --> 00:03:00.580
But you get into it quickly and get used to

54
00:03:01.223 --> 00:03:04.410
If you have any questions, just write them in the comments field

55
00:03:04.832 --> 00:03:06.624
Take care, bye!
