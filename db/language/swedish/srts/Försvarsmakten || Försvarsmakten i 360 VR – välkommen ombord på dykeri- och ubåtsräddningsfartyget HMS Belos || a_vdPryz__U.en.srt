1
00:00:08,412 --> 00:00:12,491
Welcome to the bridge - from here the ship is performed

2
00:00:12,674 --> 00:00:17,768
An officer navigates and maneuvers and has a sailor to look out for his support.

3
00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:23,756
Together, they have supervision and control over the business on board and around the ship.

4
00:00:24,286 --> 00:00:28,451
The ship's manager is often on the dock and always in place when Belos throws loose or moor-

5
00:00:28,451 --> 00:00:31,144
-Or is inserted or when it is impaired.

6
00:00:33,127 --> 00:00:37,792
Together we work as a team and help to perform the ship in a secure manner-

7
00:00:37,792 --> 00:00:41,323
-Ofort of business, time of day or weather.

8
00:00:44,680 --> 00:00:49,033
Belos is equipped with a dynamic positioning system; DP-

9
00:00:49,033 --> 00:00:55,255
-What is a system for keeping the ship still with the vessel's trusers and propellers.

10
00:00:56,198 --> 00:01:00,728
The system is used to belos to lie still over a position-

11
00:01:00,728 --> 00:01:05,726
-There underwater jobs must be performed with divers or underwater vehicles.

12
00:01:14,168 --> 00:01:19,504
Here is the dining room where we eat the three and sometimes four meals served during the day -

13
00:01:19,504 --> 00:01:25,386
-Breakfast, lunch, dinner and when we are at sea even night acquisition.

14
00:01:26,838 --> 00:01:29,434
The dining room can accommodate about 50 people.

15
00:01:39,465 --> 00:01:46,936
Here we have the gun where our three chefs cook the four goals of the day to the approximately 40 people in the crew.

16
00:01:48,220 --> 00:01:56,527
Often we have with extra staff that make it significantly more portions to be served, but it always fixes our chefs.

17
00:02:04,283 --> 00:02:09,622
Here we have the Chamber Hall that houses three large pressure chambers that are for treatment-

18
00:02:09,622 --> 00:02:13,523
-As different forms of pressure disease or diving sickness.

19
00:02:14,872 --> 00:02:20,331
Here we can treat a whole submarine crew or divers that show symptoms of pressure drop disease.

20
00:02:22,950 --> 00:02:27,000
The chamber system can be pushed down to the corresponding 350 meter deep

21
00:02:27,419 --> 00:02:34,117
-And is served by staff on the outside and the inside who ensure that the staff in the chamber system has a good environment.

22
00:02:44,931 --> 00:02:49,255
Here we are inside the chamber center wall to wall with the chamber hall.

23
00:02:49,755 --> 00:02:55,363
From here we take care of pressure increase and pressure reduction and other monitoring of the chamber system.

24
00:02:55,524 --> 00:03:01,042
The business is led by chamberwear leaders who have a number of chamber operators to their help-

25
00:03:01,042 --> 00:03:05,281
-On the outside and chamber caretaker on the inside.

26
00:03:09,939 --> 00:03:13,912
After about the Chamber Center is Belos Gym, decorated on two floors.

27
00:03:14,122 --> 00:03:18,210
Here on the upper are workout bikes and treadmills for fitness training-

28
00:03:18,532 --> 00:03:24,516
-And downstairs is the actual gym with equipment for strength and agility training.

29
00:03:30,963 --> 00:03:38,773
Here we see a seaman's cabin located at the bottom of the ship on the tires where it actually swings least and is the quietest.

30
00:03:39,371 --> 00:03:43,241
The sailors live in single cabins with a common toilet and shower department.

31
00:03:44,698 --> 00:03:51,618
A tire up is also a sauna where you can warm up after a cold working day on deck or after a diving assignment

32
00:03:58,573 --> 00:04:00,573
Here we are down in the engine room.

33
00:04:01,182 --> 00:04:04,439
Belos is a vessel with diesel electrical progress-

34
00:04:04,742 --> 00:04:11,111
-What means that we have generators that produce power that then operate the ship's propellers.

35
00:04:12,801 --> 00:04:18,282
Machine staff continuously control the various technical systems on board

36
00:04:18,364 --> 00:04:20,364
-To ensure progress.

37
00:04:20,634 --> 00:04:27,276
In the space next door is the control room from where the engine room's input system is monitored.

38
00:04:27,914 --> 00:04:33,492
During a guard, machine and control rooms are staffed by an officer and a motor.

39
00:04:41,466 --> 00:04:46,448
Here we are inside the fair where we can have a cup of coffee and unwind after the work session.

40
00:04:47,859 --> 00:04:54,066
There is also the opportunity for crew collections and meetings as well as a little finer dinner sitting.

41
00:04:55,460 --> 00:04:59,249
There is also a TV corner and a small library in the fair.

42
00:05:01,115 --> 00:05:08,385
The fair also serves as a medical place where our doctor and our healthcare providers take care of any injury cases.

43
00:05:23,277 --> 00:05:28,178
Here we see Belo's wet dive clock that is housed in a container on deck.

44
00:05:29,916 --> 00:05:36,580
The clock is staffed by two divers who are raised with relatively heavy equipment down to the dive object.

45
00:05:37,327 --> 00:05:45,435
The clock's umbilical cord supplies the divers with respiratory gas, hot water to the costumes and power to cameras and lights.

46
00:05:49,326 --> 00:05:56,741
Belo's dive system can use both air and mixed gas depending on dive depth and can be used down to 90 meters depth.

47
00:06:15,818 --> 00:06:17,447
Welcome to the diving center.

48
00:06:18,526 --> 00:06:23,620
From the dive center, all underwater activities that Belos can perform.

49
00:06:25,538 --> 00:06:29,134
In here, the diving leader is for the wet clock diving.

50
00:06:31,660 --> 00:06:39,043
The dive leader has control at times for downs and ascent and leads the divers' jobs on the dive object.

51
00:06:39,487 --> 00:06:45,581
In the dive center also sits the supervisor for the operations with our underwater vessels or prey: er

52
00:06:47,318 --> 00:06:52,970
The prey pilots here have their operator sites from which they control our various underwater vehicles.
