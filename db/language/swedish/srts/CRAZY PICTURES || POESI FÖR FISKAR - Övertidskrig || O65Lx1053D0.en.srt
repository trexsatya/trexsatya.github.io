1
00:01:16,440 --> 00:01:18,755
Ouch!
 Ouch!
 Ouch!
 No!
 Ah ..

2
00:01:18,756 --> 00:01:21,486
It's five o'clock!
 It's five o'clock!

3
00:01:21,823 --> 00:01:25,256
No, but I had stopped!

4
00:01:25,413 --> 00:01:27,258
No, my guts!

5
00:01:28,257 --> 00:01:32,113
Oh, coffee stains on the uniform.

6
00:01:33,217 --> 00:01:34,833
It's not true!

7
00:01:36,005 --> 00:01:38,325
No, they don't go away either!

8
00:01:39,415 --> 00:01:44,565
Okay ... A positive attitude reinforces the feeling of team.
 A positive ..

9
00:01:46,876 --> 00:01:49,891
We get OB anyway, that's good!

10
00:01:50,166 --> 00:01:51,673
So you get some extra money ..

11
00:01:51,816 --> 00:01:52,305
Ob?

12
00:01:52,496 --> 00:01:55,784
OB, when there is war after five o'clock you get OB.

13
00:01:55,998 --> 00:01:57,454
What, we have no ob ...

14
00:01:58,345 --> 00:02:00,469
Do you have no one .. Do you have no OB?

15
00:02:00,664 --> 00:02:01,756
We have no ob.

16
00:02:02,236 --> 00:02:07,381
Huh?
 After all, you should bring it up with the union in that case.

17
00:02:11,070 --> 00:02:12,627
What do you have in hourly wage?

18
00:02:13,081 --> 00:02:13,681
60 ...

19
00:02:13,843 --> 00:02:15,875
60 bucks?

20
00:02:17,531 --> 00:02:20,921
You know that SEK 90 is the minimum wage huh?

21
00:02:21,257 --> 00:02:25,013
We will have a planning day on Sunday too, type how we should attack you and so on,

22
00:02:25,113 --> 00:02:26,489
I don't get any money for that either.

23
00:02:26,693 --> 00:02:29,609
After all, they can't take advantage of you anyway.

24
00:02:30,010 --> 00:02:33,186
You have to get your free days, it's teams on it you know.

25
00:02:34,803 --> 00:02:36,650
Damn what soft you seem to have this.

26
00:02:37,099 --> 00:02:41,040
Yes, yes, but it's pretty good actually.

27
00:02:46,059 --> 00:02:48,334
A pastry, here too.

28
00:02:48,687 --> 00:02:50,910
But you lead anyway.

29
00:02:52,318 --> 00:02:58,315
It looked great when you came running here before too.
 You seem to be very good I think.

30
00:03:00,129 --> 00:03:04,862
But what the hell ... Do you have toilets in the trenches?

31
00:03:05,055 --> 00:03:10,742
Yes, we only had pissers before, but someone complained to the discrimination ombudsman.

32
00:03:10,922 --> 00:03:12,878
After all, not everyone has the penis.

33
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,178
Oh fuck.

34
00:03:18,853 --> 00:03:23,026
Yes, maneuver, good!
 You?
 It has run a little ..

35
00:03:23,169 --> 00:03:27,833
Breast-Bengt here has jumped on the suicide front, so I need you for the evening pass.

36
00:03:27,989 --> 00:03:29,591
AHA okay...

37
00:03:29,758 --> 00:03:32,485
I feel like I'm starting to feel a little bad, so I would love to go home.

38
00:03:32,737 --> 00:03:34,362
But then you have a medical certificate for that?

39
00:03:37,322 --> 00:03:38,863
No I do not have it...

40
00:03:39,007 --> 00:03:42,206
No, but then it is so that if you are going to have a lawful homecoming with

41
00:03:42,207 --> 00:03:46,106
Compensation and everything then a medical certificate is required.

42
00:03:46,580 --> 00:03:48,257
I really have to get this schedule together now.

43
00:03:48,459 --> 00:03:49,983
I understand it, it's mostly ..

44
00:03:50,847 --> 00:03:54,329
I might be able to take that pass.

45
00:03:54,691 --> 00:03:58,202
But you are German ...

46
00:04:02,582 --> 00:04:08,100
Yes good!
 But you, then you take the passport.
 And remember our motto:

47
00:04:09,307 --> 00:04:14,710
"A positive attitude reinforces the gut feeling".
 Requirements ... the feeling of team ...

48
00:04:18,168 --> 00:04:23,963
Yes!
 Are you cute since before you go on the next pass, just check the toilet a little neighbor?

49
00:04:24,098 --> 00:04:27,589
It looks too damn boring there, now that we have the coffee table here and everything.

50
00:04:27,787 --> 00:04:29,628
Absolutely ... Absolutely ... I fix it.

51
00:04:29,820 --> 00:04:32,003
Employee of the Month!

52
00:04:32,457 --> 00:04:36,645
Oh thanks!
 How fun.

53
00:04:44,026 --> 00:04:46,001
Oh fyfan ...

54
00:04:49,026 --> 00:04:53,001
