1
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:13,810
I was and greeted a friend who had started plugging here

2
00:00:13,810 --> 00:00:17,129
and had one of my most fun weekends ever,

3
00:00:17,129 --> 00:00:20,480
Which meant that Örebro University actually became my first choice.

4
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:24,577
I had traveled around a bit in Sweden and looked at a few different universities.

5
00:00:24,577 --> 00:00:26,804
Then I came here to Örebro.

6
00:00:26,804 --> 00:00:29,361
And then I just walked around the premises.

7
00:00:29,361 --> 00:00:31,436
I just got a good feeling.

8
00:00:31,436 --> 00:00:35,328
The important thing for me was that I saw a future.

9
00:00:35,584 --> 00:00:37,497
When I had read the training clearly

10
00:00:37,497 --> 00:00:39,845
So I could work on what I read.

11
00:00:39,845 --> 00:00:42,653
I didn't really know if I would actually take Örebro University.

12
00:00:42,653 --> 00:00:44,184
Then I went up the subway.

13
00:00:44,184 --> 00:00:47,661
Then I saw the ads and then I thought I had to start there.

14
00:00:47,661 --> 00:00:50,347
What I like about Örebro is that it is located ...

15
00:00:50,347 --> 00:00:51,715
Can you say centrally?

16
00:00:51,715 --> 00:00:55,296
It is a very central city in our elongated country.

17
00:00:55,296 --> 00:00:58,117
So it's very close to most people.

18
00:00:58,117 --> 00:01:00,825
I also think this is one of the reasons why you choose Örebro.

19
00:01:00,825 --> 00:01:02,420
Then you do not go home so often.

20
00:01:02,420 --> 00:01:06,816
So, the city, when I looked at Google Maps and so -

21
00:01:06,816 --> 00:01:08,156
After all, it wasn't like this -

22
00:01:08,156 --> 00:01:09,606
It's not a big city, after all,

23
00:01:09,662 --> 00:01:13,528
And at the same time, it is bad though good because everything is so close.

24
00:01:13,537 --> 00:01:15,071
Because it can be bad about ...

25
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:16,662
Although no, it's not bad.

26
00:01:16,662 --> 00:01:17,990
It is very close to everything.

27
00:01:17,990 --> 00:01:19,720
For example, you can cycle everywhere.

28
00:01:19,720 --> 00:01:21,794
And you are in ten minutes/a quarter,

29
00:01:21,794 --> 00:01:23,375
Actually no matter where you are going.

30
00:01:23,375 --> 00:01:26,000
From home to town it is ten minutes/a quarter.

31
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
From home to school it is ten minutes/a quarter.

32
00:01:28,430 --> 00:01:30,000
And from school into town - ten minutes/a quarter.

33
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,397
The teachers are canon.

34
00:01:31,471 --> 00:01:32,546
The teachers are great.

35
00:01:32,546 --> 00:01:35,585
I think the education at Örebro University is very good.

36
00:01:35,585 --> 00:01:38,000
There is a lot of help to be obtained.

37
00:01:38,065 --> 00:01:40,603
Something I like with Campus is to

38
00:01:40,603 --> 00:01:43,900
Most programs are gathered under one roof,

39
00:01:43,900 --> 00:01:47,927
Which makes you get to know other people who plug other things.

40
00:01:47,927 --> 00:01:51,556
The introduction at Örebro University is between three and four weeks.

41
00:01:51,556 --> 00:01:53,122
For example, if one is in the introduction

42
00:01:53,122 --> 00:01:56,233
So it is very easy to make friends and get a socializing.

43
00:01:56,233 --> 00:01:58,233
Still, I thought it was pretty easy to make friends.

44
00:01:58,233 --> 00:02:02,294
People were very likely to become friends, or what to say.

45
00:02:02,294 --> 00:02:05,694
The balance between the activities that one may do during the introduction,

46
00:02:05,694 --> 00:02:08,768
and that you have things almost every day,

47
00:02:08,768 --> 00:02:11,328
makes the introduction at Örebro University

48
00:02:11,328 --> 00:02:14,810
Easy is one of the most fun you can be involved in.

49
00:02:16,807 --> 00:02:17,752
But it's fun!

50
00:02:17,836 --> 00:02:18,863
It's really fun!
