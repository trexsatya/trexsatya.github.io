00:00:00,340 --> 00:00:09,260
Zenon from Elea (about 490-430 BC) was a natural philosopher best known for the way he argued.

2
00:00:09,660 --> 00:00:13,360
He did this mainly by constructing paradoxes

3
00:00:13,360 --> 00:00:16,540
And some of them have puzzled people ever since.

4
00:00:17,080 --> 00:00:23,580
He developed these paradoxes as arguments, for example, because movement was impossible

5
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:27,340
And that the reality we perceive must be an illusion.

6
00:00:27,560 --> 00:00:30,660
The most well -known example is "Achilles and the turtle".

7
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:36,960
Zenon uses logic and a method today called Reductio ad absurdum

8
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:42,300
- If a reasoning leads to a contradiction, its opposite must be true.

9
00:00:42,460 --> 00:00:46,960
Most interesting with these paradoxes is how a strictly logical reasoning

10
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:50,480
Seemingly can lead to an incorrect conclusion.

11
00:00:51,060 --> 00:00:58,080
Through his paradoxes, Zenon showed that philosophy and science require more of us than what we first take for granted

12
00:00:58,180 --> 00:01:01,080
- And that's why he deserves a place in philosophy history.

13
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:13,060
What happens if we let a well -trained runner (in Zenon's example Achilles, the protagonist of the Illiad)

14
00:01:13,060 --> 00:01:18,080
Compete in a 100-meter race against a turtle?
 Of course, the runner wins.

15
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:23,760
But wait a bit, says Zenon.
 Let me show that strict logic claims the opposite.

16
00:01:23,940 --> 00:01:29,340
And the logic does not lie, which is why our perception of reality must be wrong.

17
00:01:29,880 --> 00:01:35,780
We set up the contestants, but to make the competition a little fairer (and for the paradox to occur)

18
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:38,300
we give the turtle a certain lead.

19
00:01:38,780 --> 00:01:42,900
In order for Achilles to win, he must first pass the turtle

20
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,860
- And this assumes that he will first catch it.

21
00:01:46,020 --> 00:01:49,320
But this is a logical impossibility, Zenon says, explaining:

22
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:55,340
During the time it takes for Achilles to get to the place the turtle was based on

23
00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:58,580
Has the turtle has moved another distance.

24
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:06,020
At the time it now takes for Achilles to run even this stretch, the turtle has moved another piece.

25
00:02:06,020 --> 00:02:10,180
So can continue to reason until the given conclusion becomes

26
00:02:10,180 --> 00:02:12,440
That Achilles will never catch the turtle.

27
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:17,560
The distance that separates them over time becomes minimal but never zero.

28
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:24,200
If you clean the reasoning in the paradox you can show that nothing can move at all.

29
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:29,560
Do you see the problem, and how could you respond to this argument?
