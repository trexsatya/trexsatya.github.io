1
00:00:05,920 --> 00:00:12,500
I saw several different movies about laying a footpath before dealing with my own.

2
00:00:12,530 --> 00:00:17,520
I still managed to find a number of mistakes they did not include in these movies, so

3
00:00:17,540 --> 00:00:25,920
I was going to show a little again what five mistakes I made and which I avoided.

4
00:00:27,360 --> 00:00:29,700
One thing that is easy to miss is to

5
00:00:29,730 --> 00:00:33,180
The chipboard has an upside and a downside.

6
00:00:33,210 --> 00:00:37,940
I don't know what role they play, but it's just as good to do right.

7
00:00:37,960 --> 00:00:40,840
A near death experience one can avoid

8
00:00:40,870 --> 00:00:47,260
If you think about it - is that the slices are glass -backed when you have them lying on high.

9
00:00:47,290 --> 00:00:49,640
Don't try to jump down on a pile of slices

10
00:00:49,670 --> 00:00:53,980
Or take a big step between the rules on such a pile.

11
00:00:54,010 --> 00:00:56,080
It can end badly.

12
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:06,360
One of the first and most important elements

13
00:01:06,390 --> 00:01:12,620
When you put a footpath, it is to get the first row completely nail.

14
00:01:12,650 --> 00:01:17,520
If it started to skew a bit, in any direction then you get an error coming

15
00:01:17,550 --> 00:01:22,020
to reproduce throughout the floor and you will also have to fight it

16
00:01:22,050 --> 00:01:24,560
Each new line you start with and the error follows

17
00:01:24,590 --> 00:01:27,600
With all the time and you can't get rid of it.

18
00:01:30,160 --> 00:01:32,800
To get the first line straight you can

19
00:01:32,830 --> 00:01:39,210
lace the floor and above all make sure that the short sides are tight against each other.

20
00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:43,820
Are they completely tight so they don't glide anything.

21
00:01:43,850 --> 00:01:49,080
So the lines will be straight they just need to be adjusted sideways.

22
00:01:56,080 --> 00:02:01,780
A mistake I made here, it was that I started with the wrong side.

23
00:02:01,810 --> 00:02:06,320
As you can see, they are spontaneous, these chipboards.
 And if you see then they are

24
00:02:06,350 --> 00:02:08,890
on one side is a spontaneous one lying

25
00:02:08,920 --> 00:02:15,980
Close down towards the rules while the other comes as a lip from above.

26
00:02:16,010 --> 00:02:21,170
Of course, one should have the lip that lies down against the rules outwards all the time.

27
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:27,220
Then you glue it directly to the floor and you do not have the problems that I happened to

28
00:02:27,250 --> 00:02:35,260
That you should try to get this lip under the previous disc.

29
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:38,020
It makes you, when you have screwed it and glued it.

30
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:39,560
Have you waited a day so it can lie

31
00:02:39,590 --> 00:02:45,260
Lim residue or other in between that makes it completely hopeless to get it there.

32
00:02:45,290 --> 00:02:49,840
Therefore you have to check every disk you put so that

33
00:02:49,870 --> 00:02:53,540
It's free before you start to hit it.

34
00:02:53,570 --> 00:02:55,880
For have you put on glue and start knocking in

35
00:02:55,910 --> 00:03:00,420
The disc so it is not easy to remove it and correct it afterwards.

36
00:03:00,450 --> 00:03:05,140
And above all, even if it succeeds, it is very messy with all the glue.

37
00:03:05,170 --> 00:03:07,740
So start with the right side out.

38
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:09,280
It's not very hard, it's just

39
00:03:09,310 --> 00:03:14,760
that you have the right side up on the disc and make sure the lip downwards - is outward it

40
00:03:14,790 --> 00:03:18,840
You put against the new discs.

41
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:25,400
A moment I missed in the chipboard movies I saw

42
00:03:25,430 --> 00:03:29,380
Be how to get the corners together.

43
00:03:29,410 --> 00:03:32,080
To lay a long side to another long side.

44
00:03:32,110 --> 00:03:35,540
It's just pressing and it usually works quite easily.

45
00:03:35,570 --> 00:03:37,140
But what they don't show

46
00:03:37,170 --> 00:03:44,160
How they do to get both long side and short side to be tight together.

47
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:47,160
For the pros it just seems to be that

48
00:03:47,190 --> 00:03:52,300
Throw the slices there and maybe stomp kick a little on them so they end up right.

49
00:03:52,330 --> 00:03:54,340
It has not been so easy for me.

50
00:03:54,370 --> 00:03:58,060
I have therefore manufactured a hangover

51
00:03:58,090 --> 00:04:04,279
the same feature that one uses when laying

52
00:04:04,479 --> 00:04:11,140
parquet or click floor.

53
00:04:11,170 --> 00:04:14,660
And this hangover allows you to knock the disc there.

54
00:04:14,690 --> 00:04:22,540
It is not possible to knock on the real sides of the disc because it is chipboard.

55
00:04:22,570 --> 00:04:26,220
It is very easy to ruin the edges.

56
00:04:26,250 --> 00:04:30,280
The sponge on these chipboards and you have to think about that even when handling them.

57
00:04:30,280 --> 00:04:32,000
If you set them on the short side when you

58
00:04:32,030 --> 00:04:38,600
Tumps against, you immediately destroy this little chipboard spontaneous.

59
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:51,400
Another mistake you can do as man in and

60
00:04:51,420 --> 00:04:58,060
Indeed, learn quite quickly and avoid it is to put on the glue in the correct order.

61
00:04:58,090 --> 00:05:02,220
If you start by gluing on

62
00:05:02,250 --> 00:05:06,100
All the spontaneous edges, then you will hold on and scratched the glue on your hands.

63
00:05:06,130 --> 00:05:08,820
That's why I put the glue on it

64
00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:15,540
that is fixed first and then I glue on the disc that

65
00:05:15,570 --> 00:05:18,760
Should be added there.
 And you do it in the right order.

66
00:05:18,780 --> 00:05:24,000
This is how you don't have to get so much glue on your fingers as well.

67
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:29,900
And when to press the disc there

68
00:05:29,920 --> 00:05:35,640
So you also have the glue under the rules that make it slip quite easily.

69
00:05:35,640 --> 00:05:37,280
If you pull it a little back and forth so

70
00:05:37,300 --> 00:05:41,480
Spreads out the glue and then press it there.

71
00:05:42,440 --> 00:05:44,720
And as so often in the case when I lay they

72
00:05:44,750 --> 00:05:49,220
Here the discs anyway so it will not be directly in place

73
00:05:49,250 --> 00:05:53,680
Without that, when I pick up my little hangover.

74
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:06,260
The hangover I made from a piece of wastewood from another chipboard.

75
00:06:06,290 --> 00:06:13,620
Corresponding fals on the one on the disc and then I have nailed on

76
00:06:13,650 --> 00:06:18,740
Or screwed on a piece of chipboard and a block to knock.

77
00:06:18,770 --> 00:06:20,800
One does not have to take in, one should not take in

78
00:06:20,830 --> 00:06:25,060
Especially hard without it is just that you have power in the right direction.

79
00:06:25,090 --> 00:06:27,540
It is quite hopeless to gain power

80
00:06:27,570 --> 00:06:31,860
In the right direction otherwise with these discs if you are going to try hand power.

81
00:06:31,890 --> 00:06:34,680
And, as I said, you can't turn on the clean

82
00:06:34,710 --> 00:06:38,760
The edge as it is because it destroys it.

83
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:52,040
And the goal is to get in

84
00:06:52,070 --> 00:06:57,480
The slices so tight together that it penetrates glue in between.

85
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:08,060
And finally make sure to get the short side tight.

86
00:07:08,090 --> 00:07:09,380
Here you can see that it

87
00:07:09,410 --> 00:07:15,160
does not go fast, but it comes so slowly and slides in and then

88
00:07:15,190 --> 00:07:20,520
Finally, you see the glue penetrating when it is in place for real.

89
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:23,440
There comes the glue.

90
00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:57,300
Another mistake you can make as I have made here and in the past

91
00:07:57,330 --> 00:08:00,160
is that you do not have a damp cloth to wipe off the glue.

92
00:08:00,190 --> 00:08:03,620
If you do not wipe the glue.

93
00:08:03,650 --> 00:08:07,020
Then you will need to grind it away when it hardened.

94
00:08:07,040 --> 00:08:12,980
And do you as I do here, use a small piece of spill to

95
00:08:13,010 --> 00:08:18,340
Pull off the glue so it is easy to happen that you are satisfied.

96
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:24,040
At the end of the working day you leave the piece of wood and then it is glued to the floor.

97
00:08:28,480 --> 00:08:30,720
Mistake number five as i made some

98
00:08:30,750 --> 00:08:35,120
times I trust a little too much on my eye measurement.

99
00:08:36,480 --> 00:08:41,120
I screw up the chipboard to the rules.

100
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:45,640
Three screws in each rule except where you have a joint.

101
00:08:45,670 --> 00:08:52,500
There should be four screws in the chipboard on each rule beside the joint.

102
00:08:52,530 --> 00:08:55,560
And if you trust the eye measurement, you think that here is the rule

103
00:08:55,580 --> 00:09:00,040
and then it turns out that when the screw is the idled it spins

104
00:09:00,060 --> 00:09:04,540
only in the air.
 It's not a disaster

105
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:07,420
But you should not do as I did here.

106
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:10,280
To guess that “the rule is enough on it

107
00:09:10,310 --> 00:09:14,860
This page “Without doing as I do on this movie.

108
00:09:14,890 --> 00:09:18,520
Have a right disc of some kind so that you

109
00:09:18,550 --> 00:09:20,760
Can post so you know where to sit.

110
00:09:20,790 --> 00:09:22,940
Because it is easy to miss out on where the rule

111
00:09:22,970 --> 00:09:26,000
Is somewhere and it is unnecessary to be annoyed.

112
00:09:26,030 --> 00:09:29,360
By putting the wrong put the screws wrong.

113
00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:40,240
Have you got anything out of this video

114
00:09:40,270 --> 00:09:45,060
At all, please give me a thumbs up, it is more fun to make a movie.

115
