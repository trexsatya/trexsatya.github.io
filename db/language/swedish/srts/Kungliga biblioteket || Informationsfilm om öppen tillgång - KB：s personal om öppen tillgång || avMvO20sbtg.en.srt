1
00:00:01,440 --> 00:00:04,960
Open asset affects me in such a way that-

2
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:08,560
-In my work, I see it as our future.

3
00:00:08,640 --> 00:00:12,080
It is strongly linked to digitalisation.

4
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:15,560
I don't see that the libraries will be able to work-

5
00:00:15,640 --> 00:00:21,720
-Or to address the issue of open access in connection with digitalisation.

6
00:00:21,800 --> 00:00:26,840
What is paid with public funds must be openly available online.

7
00:00:26,920 --> 00:00:31,360
And in my personal life, if I search for medical information-

8
00:00:31,440 --> 00:00:38,240
-I haven't accessed the articles paid by public funds.

9
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:43,160
I also see friends who run start-ups or study ...

10
00:00:43,240 --> 00:00:49,400
Nor do they have access to what they would need to be effective.

11
00:00:50,360 --> 00:00:56,200
For me it is primarily about making books available and magazines-

12
00:00:56,280 --> 00:01:00,520
-via link server that I activate to our local directory-

13
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:03,400
-And Libris as well.

14
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:07,200
In some cases it is also about making databases available-

15
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:12,400
-When we have discovered and considered appropriate.
 Suitable.

16
00:01:12,480 --> 00:01:15,280
It is also about the project-

17
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:20,480
-As the National Library Cooperation Unit supports.

18
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:24,680
Most recently, it has been Open Book Publishers and Knowledge Unlatched.

19
00:01:24,760 --> 00:01:28,600
Then i am involved and help to make available the titles-

20
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:32,200
-Whore are included in those packages.

21
00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:37,640
The question also opens up for discussion om-

22
00:01:37,720 --> 00:01:40,520
-What the view of collection is for something-

23
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:44,960
-And what a collection looks like in the future.

24
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:50,360
KB has a fairly large printed collection of magazines-

25
00:01:50,440 --> 00:01:53,040
-When we continue to subscribe.

26
00:01:53,120 --> 00:01:57,560
When magazines go over to become solely electronic-

27
00:01:57,640 --> 00:02:01,400
-and in some cases converted to become openly available-

28
00:02:01,480 --> 00:02:06,440
-When the question is also growing: How to take advantage of that material?

29
00:02:06,520 --> 00:02:09,640
How do you want to preserve them?

30
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:12,920
Knowledge of open access is important-

31
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:16,520
-Th then you know how to use the material-

32
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:19,440
-If you know how it has been added.

33
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:22,600
When something is openly available, there can be different variants.

34
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:26,760
It may be reviewed by other researchers or lie unrespected.

35
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:32,360
There you can compare with Wikipedia, where everyone writes and reviews each other.

36
00:02:32,440 --> 00:02:35,640
But one can get into Wikipedia where it is not reviewed-

37
00:02:35,720 --> 00:02:39,160
-or in a subject that is controversial, with several opinions.

38
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:43,680
But if you know how things work, you can use them properly.

39
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:48,160
You can write: The material is not reviewed, but I want to address it anyway.

40
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:51,960
It is an important point in having knowledge of open access.

41
00:02:52,040 --> 00:02:57,640
Another thing is that you who write the material that is openly available ...

42
00:02:57,720 --> 00:03:01,840
If you know what that means, you have more power to shape the process.

43
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:08,080
As we see with the issue of copyright, where researchers ...

44
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:13,480
They have written away their copyright, the right to spread their material.

45
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:19,160
Now you talk about open licenses where researchers retain their copyright.

46
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:25,560
Here, too, knowledge is required to know what license to put, what suits it.

47
00:03:25,640 --> 00:03:30,560
It is important for those who manufacture resources or write the material-

48
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:35,080
-To know how to proceed, what choices are available.

49
00:03:35,160 --> 00:03:39,840
Yes, the proportion of openly available publications is growing-

50
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:45,000
-And there is something that will grow in the future as well.

51
00:03:45,080 --> 00:03:49,600
In that it is a matter that is current at the moment-

52
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:56,480
-So it is good for the staff to follow the issues that are relevant.

53
00:03:57,720 --> 00:04:03,800
KB is a national library that other libraries may look at-

54
00:04:03,880 --> 00:04:06,400
-and then it's good to have a plan-

55
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:10,720
-And a strategy for how to convey that knowledge.

56
00:04:11,640 --> 00:04:15,560
Part of my work is placed in external service-

57
00:04:15,640 --> 00:04:18,880
-Where I meet users and visitors.

58
00:04:18,960 --> 00:04:24,960
My view is that so far it has not come so much questions-

59
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:28,560
-On material concerning open access.

60
00:04:28,640 --> 00:04:32,240
It may be because visitors and users-

61
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:37,040
-Heas a view of what KB's collections consists of in the first place.

62
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:42,360
The printed collections or archives or audiovisual collections.

63
00:04:42,440 --> 00:04:47,240
Maybe not just openly available in the first place.

64
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:53,440
In the long term, it will change with the changing landscape now.

65
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:57,440
Then it is good that staff have the knowledge that demands-

66
00:04:57,520 --> 00:05:01,480
-To be able to guide users on the right track.
