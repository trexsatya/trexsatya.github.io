1
00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:03.600
Everyone will at some point in their lives end up in a school, in a hospital,

2
00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:06.600
elderly home or maybe even jail.

3
00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:09.680
All four places have one thing in common.

4
00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:12.000
You serve state food.

5
00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.280
But does it really taste the same

6
00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:18.120
How differs and above all where is the best

7
00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:22.000
First out we will test the food at a Swedish hospital.

8
00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:22.800
So I've booked Karo ....

9
00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:23.960
Ah, I can help you

10
00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:25.320
Shortcut to hospital

11
00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:26.960
Fille I have already booked

12
00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:32.800
Hello then, thanks asking

13
00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:36.360
Hello

14
00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:39.360
I would like to place an order on an ambulance

15
00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:46.080
Good morning

16
00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:48.040
Where are you hurt somewhere then

17
00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:49.160
A little everywhere

18
00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:50.080
A little everywhere

19
00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:51.600
Are you from Gävle

20
00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:52.280
No

21
00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:54.600
No, it sounded like that

22
00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:58.680
This section is also in paid cooperation with oboy

23
00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:03.560
What start on this day you

24
00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:12.120
Where are we now

25
00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:15.120
Now we are at Karolinska Hospital's emergency room.

26
00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:18.920
It was just a little tricky way here you can say

27
00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:30.480
We will start by undressing you

28
00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:31.920
so that we can examine you properly

29
00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:32.880
Okay

30
00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:39.320
Here we'll probably take off and see if we don't need to plaster a little

31
00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:40.400
Should we plaster

32
00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:42.320
Yes, probably the whole bone thus

33
00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:44.720
The whole leg

34
00:01:59.120 --> 00:02:01.080
What have you been out for then

35
00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:03.480
I would do a sketch.

36
00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:05.200
Okay,

37
00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:07.400
Yes it was a long way here.

38
00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:10.800
But now it's time to test the food at a Swedish hospital.

39
00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:14.400
Here we have Anette.

40
00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:16.160
She works as a dietician at the hospital

41
00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:19.800
And the menu that she and her colleagues have produced look so luxurious.

42
00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:22.080
It feels like you're at a restaurant.

43
00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:23.160
How can you afford this

44
00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:26.800
After all, it is a very expensive to keep patients in the hospital.

45
00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:31.280
So everything we can do to get patients prescribed is very important.

46
00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:33.360
If you put money on good food like that

47
00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:37.200
Can you kind of benefit them from people feeling better and can be printed faster.

48
00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:38.360
Absolutely just like that

49
00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:39.200
Damn

50
00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:42.200
It is very important for you to heal and recover.

51
00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:43.600
Lasagna Al Forno

52
00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:44.480
Absolutely

53
00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:45.640
You have deserts

54
00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:46.680
Black currant sorbet

55
00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:51.360
Päronglass, fruit salad, milk chocolate mousse, cheesecake, vanilla ice cream,

56
00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:54.560
Coffee, chocolate cake, season pie,

57
00:02:55.240 --> 00:02:56.840
Apple pie with vanilla sauce

58
00:02:56.840 --> 00:02:58.240
Yeah like it, it gets pretty good

59
00:02:58.240 --> 00:02:59.640
Something else

60
00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:02.760
Ne but i like to drink because i think it's top service

61
00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:05.040
The question is how to get there

62
00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:08.840
Should you go bed or should you ride a wheelchair

63
00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:10.440
Wheelchair sounds fun

64
00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:13.960
What is maximum speed

65
00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:15.400
Ojojojojoj

66
00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:17.280
Is this max speed

67
00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:18.240
No, it's not

68
00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:20.480
Annette you can better

69
00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:22.440
Wiii

70
00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:23.680
I fly Annette

71
00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:25.720
And here we have Cedric.

72
00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:26.920
He is a chef.

73
00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:29.920
I thought you should come with us into the kitchen and cook some jaw

74
00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:38.000
You really checked out that I'm ready.

75
00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:39.000
I don't feel ready

76
00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:42.040
I think you feel a bit half -back if I am to be honest, but we are driving

77
00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:43.760
Why did we do this

78
00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:47.160
It feels unnecessarily complicated.
 I could only go without plaster

79
00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:50.680
Now you have been up in the ward and you were a little hungry

80
00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:52.920
I got a little craving for this lasagna.

81
00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:54.000
I could almost imagine it

82
00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:55.680
I looked like such a guy

83
00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:57.280
You feel a little cat Gustav

84
00:03:59.640 --> 00:04:01.600
After all, there are several liters of bechamel you have there.

85
00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:03.520
You knew it was bechamel, that's impressive

86
00:04:03.520 --> 00:04:05.240
Do you think so

87
00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:08.040
Then we start with a little bechamel in the bottom

88
00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:09.720
So that not everything should get stuck

89
00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:11.200
Then we go with Bolognese

90
00:04:12.960 --> 00:04:14.800
Now we will have some cheese on this then it will be in the oven.

91
00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:16.120
Yes

92
00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:17.840
Buh

93
00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:18.520
Aah

94
00:04:20.360 --> 00:04:22.880
It feels more like you're at a restaurant while sitting

95
00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:24.000
And check the menu.

96
00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:25.680
Fun that you say it because that's a bit of the idea.

97
00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:30.040
For many, it is the highlight of the day just because you have happened to something.

98
00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:32.920
There is probably nothing that allows one to eat good food here as well

99
00:04:32.920 --> 00:04:36.200
Then we try to do as we want it ourselves.

100
00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:40.520
Yes, now we have finished all layers

101
00:04:40.520 --> 00:04:43.520
And now pushed into the oven.

102
00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:45.200
Buh

103
00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:45.880
Aah

104
00:04:46.840 --> 00:04:50.240
I love the reaction which is a “uh” back

105
00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:52.360
And there the lasagna is ready

106
00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:53.200
No

107
00:04:53.200 --> 00:04:54.640
No there it is inside

108
00:04:56.880 --> 00:04:59.800
When the food is done, it is packed into boxes and cooled down.

109
00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:03.880
When an order comes in, then the food is sent off to the correct department

110
00:05:03.880 --> 00:05:05.880
And there it comes with a robot.

111
00:05:05.880 --> 00:05:06.640
A robot.

112
00:05:06.640 --> 00:05:07.680
A robot.

113
00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:08.440
Oh now comes

114
00:05:08.440 --> 00:05:08.920
Hop

115
00:05:08.920 --> 00:05:09.680
Is called it

116
00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:10.480
Hop

117
00:05:10.920 --> 00:05:11.920
Then we put the food in here

118
00:05:11.920 --> 00:05:13.160
And now drive this to your department

119
00:05:13.160 --> 00:05:14.640
Now it is gassing it here

120
00:05:14.640 --> 00:05:15.880
You are allowed to tread on a little

121
00:05:16.320 --> 00:05:17.960
Takes that elevator up to your department.

122
00:05:17.960 --> 00:05:18.800
What a good

123
00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:19.560
Right

124
00:05:19.560 --> 00:05:22.680
Now it's just that you should go up and receive it and eat.

125
00:05:22.680 --> 00:05:23.520
Thanks for the help

126
00:05:23.520 --> 00:05:24.400
Thank you

127
00:05:24.920 --> 00:05:28.560
I waved goodbye to cedric while the food was shipped to the department

128
00:05:28.560 --> 00:05:32.840
Where it was heated and served, which means we have the first contribution of the competition.

129
00:05:33.200 --> 00:05:36.920
How does the hospital stand against school, senior housing and prison

130
00:05:37.280 --> 00:05:39.120
We'll see that now.

131
00:05:39.120 --> 00:05:42.560
And this lasang that has now been heated we will be able to enjoy together with

132
00:05:42.560 --> 00:05:43.680
a real patient in the hospital

133
00:05:43.680 --> 00:05:46.760
named Rolf which I just met which is very nice, faster

134
00:05:47.160 --> 00:05:48.160
Faster

135
00:05:48.400 --> 00:05:49.080
I'm joking

136
00:05:49.200 --> 00:05:49.880
I'm joking

137
00:05:50.520 --> 00:05:51.440
Tjena Rolf

138
00:05:51.440 --> 00:05:52.120
Hello

139
00:05:52.120 --> 00:05:53.800
Hi welcome

140
00:05:55.400 --> 00:05:56.480
God was good

141
00:05:56.480 --> 00:05:57.720
Yes they have good food here

142
00:05:57.720 --> 00:05:58.440
Do they have it

143
00:05:58.440 --> 00:06:00.280
Yes then, when I first came to the hospital

144
00:06:00.280 --> 00:06:04.040
So I took a picture of the menu and sent to the family in the United States.

145
00:06:04.160 --> 00:06:05.960
Sometimes you should be happy to live in Sweden

146
00:06:05.960 --> 00:06:07.840
For the most part so I am

147
00:06:08.120 --> 00:06:09.160
Bon Apetite

148
00:06:09.160 --> 00:06:10.640
Non apetite on yourself

149
00:06:15.840 --> 00:06:17.760
How come you are here

150
00:06:17.760 --> 00:06:20.960
I came in October for a cancer surgery

151
00:06:20.960 --> 00:06:22.400
Has it gone well.

152
00:06:22.680 --> 00:06:23.960
It has gone well.

153
00:06:23.960 --> 00:06:25.960
Swedish healthcare is wonderful

154
00:06:25.960 --> 00:06:27.560
And what should you do when you are done

155
00:06:27.560 --> 00:06:29.040
with this treatment completely

156
00:06:29.040 --> 00:06:31.360
I'll be happy pensioner.

157
00:06:31.360 --> 00:06:32.160
Sounds nice.

158
00:06:32.160 --> 00:06:35.160
Yes, you become like that you

159
00:06:35.600 --> 00:06:39.520
Take advantage of life more in some way when you have received such a diagnosis

160
00:06:39.520 --> 00:06:41.000
It may be a cliche

161
00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:44.760
But the moment that is most important, as long as one has the ability

162
00:06:44.760 --> 00:06:48.960
Appreciating, it comes a little natural in some way.

163
00:06:49.240 --> 00:06:53.080
But sure, one will enjoy the day

164
00:06:54.080 --> 00:06:55.440
and you are lucky

165
00:06:55.440 --> 00:06:58.440
So you can plan for the future.

166
00:06:58.920 --> 00:07:00.360
How did it taste

167
00:07:00.360 --> 00:07:01.640
I think it tasted very good

168
00:07:01.640 --> 00:07:03.440
It is well balanced

169
00:07:03.440 --> 00:07:04.880
Just like you

170
00:07:05.920 --> 00:07:07.280
Right

171
00:07:07.280 --> 00:07:09.920
And so are wet wipes

172
00:07:09.920 --> 00:07:11.520
It is because you are here I think

173
00:07:11.520 --> 00:07:13.520
Is that true, you have not received before

174
00:07:13.520 --> 00:07:15.240
Oh oh oh

175
00:07:15.240 --> 00:07:17.640
Then you get luxury to it yourself with wet napkin

176
00:07:18.960 --> 00:07:21.640
Juste there is a lot of liquor on this one

177
00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:24.560
It stings along the lips

178
00:07:24.840 --> 00:07:26.400
I'm really an idiot huh

179
00:07:26.400 --> 00:07:27.520
Jauauuououh

180
00:07:27.520 --> 00:07:27.840
No

181
00:07:32.840 --> 00:07:33.880
It is not useful with ...

182
00:07:33.880 --> 00:07:36.040
What did you do

183
00:07:37.480 --> 00:07:39.840
We'll score here, what would you say

184
00:07:39.840 --> 00:07:40.840
One to five

185
00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:42.000
One to five

186
00:07:42.360 --> 00:07:42.640
Four

187
00:07:42.640 --> 00:07:43.640
A clear four.

188
00:07:43.640 --> 00:07:46.440
I fully agree with you

189
00:07:46.440 --> 00:07:49.440
The hospital gets a four.

190
00:07:50.880 --> 00:07:52.800
Then it was just saying hello to Rolf

191
00:07:52.800 --> 00:07:56.320
Before I finally got to take off the plaster I carried all day

192
00:07:56.320 --> 00:07:57.600
Do you want to bring the home as a souvenir.

193
00:07:59.040 --> 00:08:00.720
The good indeed

194
00:08:00.720 --> 00:08:05.040
Okay, the first rating of the competition is awarded, but we have more challengers.

195
00:08:05.440 --> 00:08:08.320
Soon the elderly and the prison will show what they are going for

196
00:08:08.320 --> 00:08:11.320
But first of all school food.

197
00:08:11.400 --> 00:08:14.080
And that's why we stand here with Sandro who is a student

198
00:08:14.080 --> 00:08:16.040
At the Sverker School in Uppsala

199
00:08:16.040 --> 00:08:16.520
Yes

200
00:08:16.520 --> 00:08:17.240
Hello

201
00:08:18.120 --> 00:08:21.560
But what would you say about Swedish school food in 2024

202
00:08:21.600 --> 00:08:22.720
How does it stand

203
00:08:22.720 --> 00:08:25.720
Can we see the big analysis

204
00:08:28.520 --> 00:08:29.720
It's hard for you maybe

205
00:08:29.720 --> 00:08:31.600
What does analysis mean

206
00:08:31.600 --> 00:08:33.000
Yes it is hard maybe

207
00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:34.560
But like it is good

208
00:08:34.680 --> 00:08:36.240
Yes, the school food is good

209
00:08:36.760 --> 00:08:38.880
You don't freeze, you

210
00:08:38.880 --> 00:08:39.760
Yes

211
00:08:39.840 --> 00:08:41.760
Why didn't you say anything.

212
00:08:41.760 --> 00:08:46.200
I thought we were going to talk in there but it wasn't so

213
00:08:46.640 --> 00:08:48.800
When it really didn't.

214
00:08:48.800 --> 00:08:50.000
Should we go in or

215
00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:52.280
No, we can talk if needed

216
00:08:52.520 --> 00:08:55.120
Sandro you should not suffer.

217
00:08:55.120 --> 00:08:55.960
Ooh

218
00:08:56.800 --> 00:08:57.760
Did it go well

219
00:08:57.760 --> 00:08:59.360
Yes it went well

220
00:08:59.720 --> 00:09:01.120
Thank you for checking the situation.

221
00:09:01.120 --> 00:09:03.600
We go here so it's not so icy

222
00:09:03.600 --> 00:09:05.680
Do you miss any lesson in now

223
00:09:05.680 --> 00:09:08.680
Yeah, but I would rather do this

224
00:09:09.480 --> 00:09:11.200
And then it's time to show us the kitchen

225
00:09:11.200 --> 00:09:13.160
Yes, the kitchen

226
00:09:13.880 --> 00:09:14.720
Hey

227
00:09:16.560 --> 00:09:17.160
Mauri

228
00:09:17.360 --> 00:09:18.440
Welcome

229
00:09:18.440 --> 00:09:21.920
And thus this young man has taken us to the finish.

230
00:09:22.800 --> 00:09:25.800
We are at the kitchen

231
00:09:27.200 --> 00:09:27.640
and now

232
00:09:27.640 --> 00:09:31.240
Should we meet Jelica who is partly a wonderful person

233
00:09:31.240 --> 00:09:34.240
But above all, she is the chef at school.

234
00:09:35.200 --> 00:09:36.720
Good pat

235
00:09:38.480 --> 00:09:41.280
Hello and welcome

236
00:09:41.280 --> 00:09:42.040
No we can take over from the beginning

237
00:09:42.040 --> 00:09:43.920
You are already wonderful

238
00:09:43.920 --> 00:09:45.000
I was just going

239
00:09:46.720 --> 00:09:47.640
They are filming now

240
00:09:47.640 --> 00:09:48.880
They are filming now

241
00:09:48.880 --> 00:09:49.760
No god be embarrassing

242
00:09:49.760 --> 00:09:51.560
Oh no they have already started

243
00:09:51.840 --> 00:09:54.640
Oh my good, what this got crazy

244
00:09:54.640 --> 00:09:56.160
But we take it from the beginning.

245
00:09:56.160 --> 00:09:58.000
We'll take it over

246
00:10:02.840 --> 00:10:04.560
And now we stand here with Jelica

247
00:10:05.680 --> 00:10:07.440
You are a chef at SVERERS School

248
00:10:07.440 --> 00:10:10.120
Yes, hello and welcome to the Sverker School's

249
00:10:10.120 --> 00:10:13.200
Dining room and kitchen

250
00:10:13.440 --> 00:10:14.200
Thanks

251
00:10:14.200 --> 00:10:17.960
I am responsible chef

252
00:10:17.960 --> 00:10:20.520
My home is here at Sverker School's kitchen

253
00:10:20.520 --> 00:10:22.600
Would you say it is good food at Sverkerskolan

254
00:10:22.600 --> 00:10:26.160
I think the food is excellent

255
00:10:26.160 --> 00:10:29.320
And then I think you should accompany me to the kitchen and see how it goes

256
00:10:29.320 --> 00:10:31.960
Well then we take the step to the kitchen

257
00:10:31.960 --> 00:10:33.520
Then we take the step to the kitchen

258
00:10:33.520 --> 00:10:35.640
come along

259
00:10:35.640 --> 00:10:36.520
Before I run in.

260
00:10:36.520 --> 00:10:37.800
I have a very fast thing

261
00:10:37.800 --> 00:10:39.080
Can I only get a minute.

262
00:10:39.080 --> 00:10:40.160
Yep, it is going well

263
00:10:42.880 --> 00:10:43.600
Today

264
00:10:43.600 --> 00:10:47.320
We visit various institutions that have always been there.

265
00:10:47.480 --> 00:10:50.480
Healthcare, school, elderly care.

266
00:10:50.520 --> 00:10:53.520
I would like to take the opportunity to pay tribute to another

267
00:10:53.640 --> 00:10:55.280
Swedish institution

268
00:10:55.280 --> 00:10:56.480
Oboyen

269
00:10:56.480 --> 00:10:58.240
As this section is in paid

270
00:10:58.240 --> 00:10:59.960
in cooperation with.

271
00:11:02.200 --> 00:11:06.280
Do you hear the sound, the sound of the spoon that mixes an oboy

272
00:11:06.280 --> 00:11:08.880
Almost like a melody

273
00:11:13.760 --> 00:11:16.520
Yes, it's really just a spoon that mixes oboy

274
00:11:16.520 --> 00:11:20.040
But also a sound that, like sounding through us for generations.

275
00:11:20.640 --> 00:11:22.960
The sounding after sports training, ringing scents.

276
00:11:22.960 --> 00:11:25.200
The sounding after school trips

277
00:11:25.200 --> 00:11:28.200
The sound that continues today.

278
00:11:28.560 --> 00:11:31.560
That said, a Swedish institution.

279
00:11:31.560 --> 00:11:35.600
And one thing you can forget is how much you can do with oboy

280
00:11:35.600 --> 00:11:37.280
Everyone has it in their pantry

281
00:11:37.280 --> 00:11:39.680
Here, for example, we have some really crispy

282
00:11:39.680 --> 00:11:42.920
Popcorn cookies that take less than a quarter to throw together.

283
00:11:43.080 --> 00:11:48.160
Or as my friend Max taught me when we were little milk, cornflakes and oboy on top.

284
00:11:48.600 --> 00:11:51.720
Or an ordinary oboy.

285
00:11:57.720 --> 00:12:01.080
When winter wines the coldest, there is always oboy there

286
00:12:01.080 --> 00:12:05.720
And it stands for security, joy and adventure.

287
00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:09.240
But basically it is simply a glass of chocolate milk that is

288
00:12:09.240 --> 00:12:12.240
Very, very good.

289
00:12:15.400 --> 00:12:18.040
Well then we take the step to the kitchen

290
00:12:18.040 --> 00:12:19.600
Then we take the step to the kitchen

291
00:12:19.600 --> 00:12:21.720
come along

292
00:12:21.720 --> 00:12:24.000
Should we greet my friends here.

293
00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:27.000
Absolutely.
 Are all here friends

294
00:12:27.280 --> 00:12:29.280
Everyone is my friends.

295
00:12:29.280 --> 00:12:30.240
Buddy number 1

296
00:12:30.240 --> 00:12:31.960
Buddy number 1, abbe

297
00:12:31.960 --> 00:12:33.280
Abbe, serve

298
00:12:33.280 --> 00:12:34.000
Lena

299
00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:34.960
Buddy number

300
00:12:35.760 --> 00:12:37.440
Everyone is number one.

301
00:12:37.440 --> 00:12:38.280
Everyone is number one.

302
00:12:39.200 --> 00:12:41.280
Buddy number 1, Lena

303
00:12:41.280 --> 00:12:44.280
And here Abbe is fixing pulled pork

304
00:12:47.800 --> 00:12:49.800
Then we have Lena here.

305
00:12:49.800 --> 00:12:52.480
She is about to take up chicken fajitas

306
00:12:56.520 --> 00:12:58.360
Here we have one to buddy

307
00:12:58.360 --> 00:12:59.080
Therese

308
00:12:59.080 --> 00:13:00.200
Here she a good boss

309
00:13:00.200 --> 00:13:01.240
She is a good boss

310
00:13:01.240 --> 00:13:02.160
I can imagine it.

311
00:13:06.280 --> 00:13:07.680
And now we are

312
00:13:07.680 --> 00:13:09.160
Arriving in the serving

313
00:13:09.160 --> 00:13:10.560
Do you have soup too

314
00:13:10.560 --> 00:13:13.360
And so we have freshly baked bread here too.

315
00:13:13.360 --> 00:13:15.120
You are so incredibly ambitious.

316
00:13:15.120 --> 00:13:18.600
Still, think what an important difference you make for society with your job.

317
00:13:19.160 --> 00:13:20.880
Thank you

318
00:13:21.600 --> 00:13:23.480
Now I get embarrassed

319
00:13:23.520 --> 00:13:24.800
Do you become embarrassed

320
00:13:24.800 --> 00:13:26.320
Why do you get embarrassed

321
00:13:26.320 --> 00:13:29.280
You serve food for hundreds of children every day

322
00:13:29.280 --> 00:13:32.040
It's not just me, it's all my friends.

323
00:13:32.040 --> 00:13:33.960
But can you feel this in here.

324
00:13:33.960 --> 00:13:35.240
Yes I can

325
00:13:35.240 --> 00:13:36.120
That you make a difference

326
00:13:36.120 --> 00:13:39.560
When they come and say thank you for the food, then you get warm in the heart.

327
00:13:39.560 --> 00:13:41.360
It gets hot in the heart

328
00:13:41.360 --> 00:13:43.160
Then it gets hot in the heart

329
00:13:43.160 --> 00:13:45.000
Will you continue to work on this

330
00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:46.080
Yes Yes.

331
00:13:46.080 --> 00:13:49.240
When I came to Sweden, I worked as a maid and that

332
00:13:49.240 --> 00:13:52.240
Was my first job right here at this school.

333
00:13:52.240 --> 00:13:55.200
You started at this school as a maid.

334
00:13:55.200 --> 00:13:57.480
And then so

335
00:13:57.480 --> 00:14:01.000
I always looked in as I walked here in the corridor past

336
00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:04.160
I thought it was very exciting and interesting here in the kitchen.

337
00:14:04.600 --> 00:14:07.800
So you could literally go past that door over there.

338
00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:09.680
Yes, that door over there.

339
00:14:09.680 --> 00:14:11.000
And then I look in here.

340
00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:12.480
It smelled good.

341
00:14:12.480 --> 00:14:14.080
You got hungry when working.

342
00:14:15.240 --> 00:14:16.680
Then you wanted to.

343
00:14:16.680 --> 00:14:19.040
Maybe I'll invest in that profession.

344
00:14:19.040 --> 00:14:21.200
Yes, and that's it.

345
00:14:21.200 --> 00:14:22.840
And now I'm standing here.

346
00:14:22.840 --> 00:14:25.840
And I'm a chef.
 What a thing

347
00:14:26.160 --> 00:14:28.080
What a lucky thing you came to Sweden

348
00:14:28.080 --> 00:14:29.120
Really

349
00:14:29.120 --> 00:14:31.120
And make such good food here at Sverker School

350
00:14:31.120 --> 00:14:33.520
Thanks

351
00:14:33.520 --> 00:14:34.640
What happens now

352
00:14:34.640 --> 00:14:37.840
Lowering down the food, preparing out in serving

353
00:14:37.840 --> 00:14:41.160
Then the staff should have their rest itself

354
00:14:41.160 --> 00:14:43.840
And since it's Friday today.

355
00:14:43.840 --> 00:14:48.640
So every Friday we find some fun play

356
00:14:48.640 --> 00:14:49.480
VA

357
00:14:49.480 --> 00:14:52.960
If you want to join it, you have to do it.

358
00:14:52.960 --> 00:14:54.000
If we want

359
00:14:55.640 --> 00:14:56.760
Me and now

360
00:14:56.760 --> 00:14:59.840
My friends will have our Friday night.

361
00:14:59.880 --> 00:15:01.360
We will do two teams.

362
00:15:01.360 --> 00:15:06.040
The game is about building pyramid with

363
00:15:12.040 --> 00:15:13.320
Spaghetti.

364
00:15:13.320 --> 00:15:14.840
Do you play like this every Friday

365
00:15:14.840 --> 00:15:15.840
Every Friday

366
00:15:16.240 --> 00:15:17.880
God what a good thing

367
00:15:17.880 --> 00:15:21.600
Friends, now we start with two teams.

368
00:15:21.600 --> 00:15:24.600
Team their, team abbe

369
00:15:24.720 --> 00:15:27.720
Clear, finished, start.

370
00:15:29.760 --> 00:15:31.920
It feels a bit like being the best in test.

371
00:15:31.920 --> 00:15:33.640
That you and I are David and Babben.

372
00:15:33.640 --> 00:15:37.640
I'm like a long red -haired David Sundin and you, like Bosnian Bab

373
00:15:37.640 --> 00:15:40.080
That stands here and monitors the tests

374
00:15:45.560 --> 00:15:49.320
Yes, now it's only 30 seconds left.

375
00:15:52.680 --> 00:15:56.200
3, 2, 1

376
00:15:56.200 --> 00:15:58.200
Drop, release, release, release

377
00:15:58.200 --> 00:15:58.960
Release Lena

378
00:15:58.960 --> 00:16:01.680
Drop, release, release, release

379
00:16:01.680 --> 00:16:03.400
Lena you hold

380
00:16:06.360 --> 00:16:09.240
Teams its, team their won

381
00:16:09.240 --> 00:16:11.720
Lena, you take on this loss

382
00:16:11.720 --> 00:16:13.520
No, I absolutely don't

383
00:16:13.520 --> 00:16:16.160
Don't be sad Lena.

384
00:16:16.160 --> 00:16:17.960
I offer some coffee.

385
00:16:17.960 --> 00:16:19.120
Who has cooked

386
00:16:19.120 --> 00:16:21.080
It's the chef.

387
00:16:29.160 --> 00:16:30.640
They are very good

388
00:16:30.640 --> 00:16:33.240
Thanks so much thanks!

389
00:16:33.240 --> 00:16:35.960
The coffee tastes good

390
00:16:35.960 --> 00:16:39.480
Oh cappuchino is my favorite.

391
00:16:45.160 --> 00:16:48.040
She really wants to wait for her coffee for after dinner

392
00:16:48.040 --> 00:16:50.000
But she's good at

393
00:16:50.920 --> 00:16:53.000
May you reveal

394
00:16:54.120 --> 00:16:56.000
The food is ready so I think I

395
00:16:56.000 --> 00:16:59.760
Should go and meet some students and eat eating school food with them.

396
00:16:59.800 --> 00:17:02.000
Do you think you can win the competition

397
00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:03.720
Yes, I actually think so.

398
00:17:03.720 --> 00:17:05.360
Do you have a winning skull, do you want to win against them

399
00:17:05.360 --> 00:17:07.040
Obviously I want to win.

400
00:17:07.040 --> 00:17:10.560
And the food today we will eat with Signe and Otto.
 Yes.

401
00:17:23.760 --> 00:17:25.080
Will you win this or

402
00:17:25.080 --> 00:17:26.280
yes, I think so

403
00:17:26.280 --> 00:17:29.560
I hope at least the school will win

404
00:17:29.560 --> 00:17:32.480
Hope Sverkerskolan is now delivering

405
00:17:32.480 --> 00:17:35.480
One two Three.

406
00:17:38.680 --> 00:17:40.440
It's like good flavors

407
00:17:40.440 --> 00:17:42.760
It tastes kind of like restaurant food a little

408
00:17:45.520 --> 00:17:46.560
Fresh

409
00:17:46.560 --> 00:17:48.120
Yeah fresh is it after all

410
00:17:50.160 --> 00:17:51.960
Eaten and clear.

411
00:17:51.960 --> 00:17:55.720
We are now rating each institution, every public meal.

412
00:17:55.880 --> 00:17:58.520
What would you rate on the food

413
00:17:58.520 --> 00:17:59.800
Then i say 5 then

414
00:17:59.800 --> 00:18:01.440
You say five, five dots

415
00:18:01.440 --> 00:18:02.440
Five out of five

416
00:18:02.440 --> 00:18:03.440
Signe

417
00:18:04.080 --> 00:18:05.200
Yes, also five

418
00:18:05.200 --> 00:18:07.000
You give fives

419
00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:09.920
Yes, it was very good.

420
00:18:09.920 --> 00:18:14.520
But I still think, if I have to be fair because it is still competition.

421
00:18:15.160 --> 00:18:16.920
I would put a four

422
00:18:16.920 --> 00:18:18.440
It feels fair

423
00:18:18.440 --> 00:18:19.400
Yes, that sounds good.

424
00:18:19.400 --> 00:18:22.040
Do you know who is the chef in here

425
00:18:22.040 --> 00:18:22.800
No

426
00:18:22.800 --> 00:18:24.000
You haven't met her

427
00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:27.880
Wouldn't it be fun if you just went in and thanked her for making such good food.

428
00:18:27.880 --> 00:18:30.040
I think she would be very happy.

429
00:18:32.280 --> 00:18:34.160
I think it is very appreciated that you

430
00:18:34.160 --> 00:18:38.160
as well as prepare food for us and that it likes to put down your own time

431
00:18:38.160 --> 00:18:41.240
To work with this to make food for this school.

432
00:18:47.680 --> 00:18:49.960
Thank you for cooking

433
00:18:54.360 --> 00:18:57.320
The heart does this a little extra

434
00:18:57.320 --> 00:19:00.600
While wanting to just, yeah

435
00:19:04.440 --> 00:19:04.480
So that's why it became

436
00:19:04.480 --> 00:19:09.200
You were kind of happy to say that because you appreciate it so much.

437
00:19:09.200 --> 00:19:12.960
That she, like cooking the food we eat

438
00:19:12.960 --> 00:19:16.080
And in the middle of this fine we leave Uppsala.

439
00:19:16.080 --> 00:19:18.280
It was an honor to meet you

440
00:19:18.560 --> 00:19:20.760
It was an honor to meet you

441
00:19:24.040 --> 00:19:27.160
Thanks.
 I move on.
 Bye.

442
00:19:27.160 --> 00:19:29.400
There will be four out of five in grades to the school as well.

443
00:19:29.400 --> 00:19:32.720
Which thus goes up in split first place with the hospital.

444
00:19:32.720 --> 00:19:37.560
Soon we will see if Sweden's largest prisons serve better food than this.

445
00:19:37.560 --> 00:19:41.040
But first of all, we will test the food in elderly care.

446
00:19:41.040 --> 00:19:43.600
So I went to a dementia residence outside Stockholm

447
00:19:44.280 --> 00:19:48.600
And that's why we stand here at Mälar Backen's care and care accommodation with you Stefan

448
00:19:48.600 --> 00:19:50.400
Thank you good day

449
00:19:50.400 --> 00:19:51.080
Did you say please

450
00:19:51.080 --> 00:19:56.160
Yes yes, a reminder so I know who I am

451
00:19:56.160 --> 00:19:57.560
Today is also fat day.

452
00:19:57.560 --> 00:20:00.680
Yes my wife said I had a name day.

453
00:20:00.680 --> 00:20:02.640
Said your wife that you had a name day

454
00:20:02.640 --> 00:20:05.640
Fettis

455
00:20:06.080 --> 00:20:09.840
But I'll be able to come in and test the food today

456
00:20:09.840 --> 00:20:10.520
Good luck

457
00:20:10.520 --> 00:20:11.320
Are you ready

458
00:20:11.320 --> 00:20:12.600
Jajamensan.

459
00:20:12.600 --> 00:20:15.240
To what tones do we and this day drive?

460
00:20:15.240 --> 00:20:18.960
Now it is summer now it is sun now it is koskit in the pasture.

461
00:20:20.040 --> 00:20:21.320
Then how does it continue

462
00:20:21.320 --> 00:20:23.040
No, I dare not

463
00:20:23.040 --> 00:20:24.080
It gets worse

464
00:20:24.080 --> 00:20:25.360
Yes

465
00:20:25.360 --> 00:20:26.920
And now we stand here with Tobias.

466
00:20:26.920 --> 00:20:27.520
Jajemen

467
00:20:27.520 --> 00:20:28.560
You are a chef here.

468
00:20:28.560 --> 00:20:29.080
That's right.

469
00:20:29.080 --> 00:20:30.760
What is on the menu today

470
00:20:30.760 --> 00:20:33.600
Today we have fish piccata with tomato sauce.

471
00:20:33.600 --> 00:20:35.160
Semlor for dessert

472
00:20:35.160 --> 00:20:36.520
Because it's fat day

473
00:20:36.520 --> 00:20:37.320
Just

474
00:20:37.320 --> 00:20:39.600
My wife told me this morning.

475
00:20:39.600 --> 00:20:41.680
Today is the name day.

476
00:20:41.680 --> 00:20:42.800
And then I said, "What is it"

477
00:20:42.800 --> 00:20:44.680
And she just: "It's Fatty Day"

478
00:20:45.640 --> 00:20:47.680
It was fun.

479
00:20:47.680 --> 00:20:48.960
But I think you and me,

480
00:20:48.960 --> 00:20:49.720
Jajemän

481
00:20:49.720 --> 00:20:51.280
We start cooking.

482
00:20:52.240 --> 00:20:52.880
I like

483
00:20:52.880 --> 00:20:53.640
F*ck yeah

484
00:20:53.640 --> 00:20:54.840
Oh yeah

485
00:20:56.920 --> 00:20:59.680
So if you just take a fish and give a little like this.

486
00:20:59.680 --> 00:21:01.280
It becomes like a giggle as well.

487
00:21:01.280 --> 00:21:02.920
How many portions of food do you make in a day

488
00:21:02.920 --> 00:21:05.720
About 900 in total

489
00:21:06.120 --> 00:21:07.240
Oh damn

490
00:21:09.760 --> 00:21:10.760
Okay, what happens now

491
00:21:10.760 --> 00:21:13.120
I thought we might do some bran.

492
00:21:13.120 --> 00:21:15.320
Semlor

493
00:21:19.840 --> 00:21:22.800
Pretty good job huh

494
00:21:22.800 --> 00:21:24.000
Really

495
00:21:24.000 --> 00:21:26.920
You are so persuasive

496
00:21:26.920 --> 00:21:28.560
It will be great

497
00:21:28.560 --> 00:21:31.200
You just make it worse.

498
00:21:31.200 --> 00:21:34.200
Now only the cream is left.

499
00:21:42.800 --> 00:21:46.080
Have never had as bad self -confidence as when I cook in front of you

500
00:21:48.280 --> 00:21:50.600
Like you're about to start crying because it's so ugly

501
00:21:50.600 --> 00:21:53.000
No, really not

502
00:21:56.480 --> 00:21:57.600
And there

503
00:21:57.600 --> 00:21:58.760
There yes

504
00:21:59.480 --> 00:22:00.440
Take a holiday

505
00:22:00.440 --> 00:22:01.360
Can i do it

506
00:22:01.360 --> 00:22:02.360
Take a holiday

507
00:22:02.360 --> 00:22:04.440
It is good thus

508
00:22:04.440 --> 00:22:06.440
Is it good or

509
00:22:07.200 --> 00:22:08.040
MMH

510
00:22:08.040 --> 00:22:10.120
Yeah that's good

511
00:22:10.720 --> 00:22:12.920
Can you say something persuasive

512
00:22:12.920 --> 00:22:14.280
Can you make me believe in something

513
00:22:14.280 --> 00:22:17.280
It is delicious, it is absolutely

514
00:22:20.160 --> 00:22:21.080
Thousand thanks

515
00:22:21.080 --> 00:22:22.360
I was good.

516
00:22:22.360 --> 00:22:23.080
Very capable

517
00:22:23.080 --> 00:22:24.880
I think it was great.

518
00:22:42.360 --> 00:22:45.280
Then it is finally time to see how the elderly care can handle

519
00:22:45.280 --> 00:22:47.240
In this competition.

520
00:22:47.240 --> 00:22:48.480
Are you tagged

521
00:22:48.480 --> 00:22:50.240
You can say that definitely.

522
00:22:52.200 --> 00:22:55.200
Should we stop talking now and eat instead

523
00:22:55.200 --> 00:22:57.840
God huh you have become cocky since imorses

524
00:22:57.840 --> 00:22:59.920
Sure I have become

525
00:23:02.800 --> 00:23:04.640
Cheers

526
00:23:06.000 --> 00:23:09.640
The table we sit at we call bb because it is the best table

527
00:23:09.720 --> 00:23:11.400
The craziest sits there

528
00:23:11.400 --> 00:23:13.320
Are you as a gang of own you 3

529
00:23:13.320 --> 00:23:14.240
Yes it has become it

530
00:23:14.240 --> 00:23:16.200
Are you like coolest on the place type

531
00:23:16.200 --> 00:23:17.600
Feel honored

532
00:23:17.600 --> 00:23:18.640
You are.

533
00:23:18.640 --> 00:23:20.000
Yes, we think so ourselves.

534
00:23:20.000 --> 00:23:22.800
Yes, you think so.
 I see it on you.

535
00:23:22.800 --> 00:23:25.440
After all, I was never the cool gang when I went to high school.

536
00:23:25.440 --> 00:23:28.200
This is like my establishment.

537
00:23:28.200 --> 00:23:30.760
It must be a tricky disease dementia

538
00:23:30.760 --> 00:23:32.000
Not for us

539
00:23:34.000 --> 00:23:37.440
I don't think you notice so much yourself, but there are others who notice and point out

540
00:23:37.440 --> 00:23:40.080
The name you don't remember, we talked about that

541
00:23:40.080 --> 00:23:41.000
Namen that i have forgotten

542
00:23:41.000 --> 00:23:42.880
Is it a painful insight in any way.

543
00:23:42.880 --> 00:23:43.920
No

544
00:23:43.920 --> 00:23:45.840
It's not anywhere,

545
00:23:45.840 --> 00:23:51.000
However, for our relatives, it is probably a painful illness

546
00:23:51.520 --> 00:23:54.680
Yes maybe it is more painful for the relatives than for one's self

547
00:23:54.680 --> 00:23:55.880
So it actually

548
00:24:00.880 --> 00:24:01.920
That was good.

549
00:24:01.920 --> 00:24:03.080
Yes, delicious.

550
00:24:04.160 --> 00:24:06.120
Should we take in the dessert

551
00:24:06.120 --> 00:24:19.480
Semla, Semla, Semla

552
00:24:19.480 --> 00:24:21.320
Is no one here that hears us

553
00:24:21.560 --> 00:24:24.600
It is so depressed that no one comes in

554
00:24:27.880 --> 00:24:30.720
Semla, Semla, Semla

555
00:24:32.120 --> 00:24:33.840
God was good it is with bran.

556
00:24:33.840 --> 00:24:35.640
Sure it's that

557
00:24:35.640 --> 00:24:37.200
Absolutely wonderfully good

558
00:24:39.520 --> 00:24:41.880
Okay the gang, final grade then.

559
00:24:41.880 --> 00:24:43.120
What do you say 1 to 5

560
00:24:43.120 --> 00:24:44.840
If 5 is at most then I take a 5

561
00:24:45.080 --> 00:24:45.520
-—-—-

562
00:24:45.800 --> 00:24:46.280
-—-—-

563
00:24:46.560 --> 00:24:47.600
I take the five -man too then

564
00:24:47.600 --> 00:24:49.240
Takes all five

565
00:24:49.440 --> 00:24:50.800
Four and a half then

566
00:24:52.920 --> 00:24:56.120
I would probably put and that's a good rating but I put a third

567
00:24:56.280 --> 00:24:57.160
Oh

568
00:24:57.160 --> 00:24:58.640
But what is well good

569
00:24:58.640 --> 00:24:59.680
No that is not it

570
00:24:59.680 --> 00:25:01.920
Are you not satisfied

571
00:25:03.840 --> 00:25:05.800
You get what you want.

572
00:25:05.800 --> 00:25:07.320
What are you going to do about the thing Stefan

573
00:25:07.320 --> 00:25:10.120
It's my program.

574
00:25:10.120 --> 00:25:13.400
It's the only thing I feel I would like to do now

575
00:25:13.400 --> 00:25:15.480
As you are the cool gang

576
00:25:15.640 --> 00:25:17.200
Can't we

577
00:25:17.200 --> 00:25:18.840
Cool us down a bit

578
00:25:19.560 --> 00:25:20.520
What did you say

579
00:25:20.520 --> 00:25:22.080
Cool us down a bit

580
00:25:22.080 --> 00:25:23.520
Shall we cool down a bit

581
00:25:23.760 --> 00:25:25.560
Sounds that like a plan

582
00:25:33.600 --> 00:25:35.640
Yes, so we kept going and cool down.

583
00:25:35.640 --> 00:25:38.640
Threw snowballs on passersby, mucked quarrels

584
00:25:38.640 --> 00:25:41.640
with each other, made cool greetings and finally

585
00:25:41.640 --> 00:25:44.640
A farewell.

586
00:25:45.480 --> 00:25:48.440
And so we only have one visit left.

587
00:25:48.440 --> 00:25:50.560
Kumlaanstalten outside Örebro

588
00:25:50.560 --> 00:25:53.880
Where we will meet the officer Sofia.

589
00:25:53.880 --> 00:25:57.520
Behind these walls that are most guarded throughout Sweden

590
00:25:57.760 --> 00:26:00.760
Almost no visitor gets access.

591
00:26:01.400 --> 00:26:03.360
But we, we may come in

592
00:26:03.360 --> 00:26:07.080
On one of the more exclusive visits to Swedish Youtube history you can say

593
00:26:07.080 --> 00:26:08.000
Absolutely

594
00:26:08.000 --> 00:26:09.760
Or in Swedish television history

595
00:26:09.760 --> 00:26:12.560
Not many people have seen the inside.

596
00:26:12.560 --> 00:26:14.760
It's at that level.

597
00:26:14.760 --> 00:26:17.760
Should be incredibly fun.

598
00:26:18.600 --> 00:26:19.680
Is there anyone who sees us

599
00:26:19.680 --> 00:26:22.280
Here is someone who sees every step you take

600
00:26:22.280 --> 00:26:24.120
Okay now we're soon inside

601
00:26:26.160 --> 00:26:27.520
Hello

602
00:26:28.840 --> 00:26:30.000
Who am I talking to

603
00:26:31.320 --> 00:26:32.400
Tjena Jens

604
00:26:32.400 --> 00:26:33.480
Can I come in

605
00:26:36.360 --> 00:26:36.840
You have.

606
00:26:36.840 --> 00:26:38.720
You have now demonstrated your power Jens.

607
00:26:38.720 --> 00:26:41.600
Can you just let us in it's cold.

608
00:26:45.840 --> 00:26:48.640
Who wins the best in test

609
00:26:50.320 --> 00:26:53.520
What a world we are on our way and step in.

610
00:26:53.520 --> 00:26:54.880
Should you also be visited

611
00:26:54.880 --> 00:26:56.840
As soon as I go out and go in again.

612
00:26:57.880 --> 00:27:00.880
Exactly the same system as at airports.

613
00:27:02.560 --> 00:27:05.880
Now you are on your way into the part where all administrative staff work.

614
00:27:05.880 --> 00:27:08.880
Then we will go into the real prison.

615
00:27:11.120 --> 00:27:14.120
As a person, you have a very exciting story.

616
00:27:14.840 --> 00:27:17.840
You fled to Sweden from Congo about 30 years ago.

617
00:27:17.840 --> 00:27:18.880
Soon 34

618
00:27:18.880 --> 00:27:21.480
And then you have made a rocket career within the Prison Service

619
00:27:21.480 --> 00:27:23.440
And now head of Sweden's largest institution.

620
00:27:23.440 --> 00:27:26.400
Would not describe my career as a rocket

621
00:27:26.400 --> 00:27:29.200
It must be said like a rocket

622
00:27:29.200 --> 00:27:33.120
But we are here to test food today on a prison.

623
00:27:33.320 --> 00:27:34.960
How good is the food?

624
00:27:34.960 --> 00:27:35.880
Very good.

625
00:27:35.880 --> 00:27:39.800
The punishment itself is that they are with us here and will serve their sentence.

626
00:27:39.960 --> 00:27:42.440
Then we also have to take care of them.

627
00:27:42.440 --> 00:27:45.520
Make sure they do not return to crime.

628
00:27:45.520 --> 00:27:49.640
Thus, to maintain a decent standard of living in here.

629
00:27:49.640 --> 00:27:52.360
Reduce the risk of committing new crimes and they will very safely.

630
00:27:52.360 --> 00:27:54.240
Very safe

631
00:27:54.440 --> 00:27:55.840
Very safe

632
00:27:56.880 --> 00:27:57.960
Thousand thanks

633
00:27:59.640 --> 00:28:02.160
Then I was led towards the prison itself

634
00:28:02.160 --> 00:28:05.480
through quantities of doors, gates, corridors and locks

635
00:28:05.680 --> 00:28:09.120
Until I ended up in a department that was just renovated this day.

636
00:28:09.560 --> 00:28:12.560
And here is literally there

637
00:28:12.560 --> 00:28:15.560
The prisoners at Sweden's largest security prison live.

638
00:28:15.640 --> 00:28:17.280
Yeah not there because it's a cleaning scrub

639
00:28:17.280 --> 00:28:19.160
Yeah okay but there

640
00:28:19.160 --> 00:28:22.520
And here is like a cell.

641
00:28:22.880 --> 00:28:23.800
Yes absolutely.

642
00:28:26.360 --> 00:28:28.040
That's how it looks

643
00:28:28.040 --> 00:28:29.280
Is this like everything

644
00:28:29.280 --> 00:28:32.200
Yes, here for 12 hours

645
00:28:34.440 --> 00:28:37.000
No not so fun.

646
00:28:37.000 --> 00:28:38.800
Is this toilet no.

647
00:28:38.800 --> 00:28:40.520
Yes

648
00:28:41.840 --> 00:28:43.360
it's not fun.

649
00:28:43.360 --> 00:28:46.360
No, it's a boring and tough environment they may be in

650
00:28:47.000 --> 00:28:48.480
There is no dance on roses.

651
00:28:48.480 --> 00:28:50.520
How long would I survive in this environment

652
00:28:50.520 --> 00:28:53.240
I have a quarter of a quarter in me.

653
00:28:53.240 --> 00:28:55.520
It depends on which department you sit on.

654
00:28:55.520 --> 00:28:58.520
I would not sit in this department it feels like

655
00:28:58.680 --> 00:29:01.120
maybe not really but i know where you could sit

656
00:29:01.120 --> 00:29:02.640
We have another department

657
00:29:02.640 --> 00:29:03.960
A small fog

658
00:29:03.960 --> 00:29:05.160
Yes a little so

659
00:29:05.960 --> 00:29:07.200
And what we are in.

660
00:29:07.200 --> 00:29:10.280
It is a special department in a way you can say for it.

661
00:29:10.560 --> 00:29:12.960
Here you cook the food yourself

662
00:29:13.480 --> 00:29:15.120
Do you have a knife and stuff.

663
00:29:15.120 --> 00:29:17.360
It is stuck and is stuck properly

664
00:29:17.360 --> 00:29:21.000
If you are here at the same time and talk to someone, then you stand a bit away.

665
00:29:21.360 --> 00:29:25.200
Now my photographer is lucky that he is on the right side.

666
00:29:25.200 --> 00:29:26.400
Here it takes a stop.

667
00:29:26.400 --> 00:29:29.320
Here comes some prisoners, big and strong he was on the left

668
00:29:29.320 --> 00:29:31.400
They are quite bitty some of them here

669
00:29:31.400 --> 00:29:33.720
They will not cure me against it I can say

670
00:29:33.720 --> 00:29:34.880
But most are right okay

671
00:29:34.880 --> 00:29:35.680
They are.

672
00:29:35.680 --> 00:29:36.680
They are fun to have and do with

673
00:29:36.680 --> 00:29:38.080
What is it like to work close to them

674
00:29:38.080 --> 00:29:41.760
In my case, I feel that I meet the person, not the crime.

675
00:29:41.760 --> 00:29:42.720
I have to be able to go in

676
00:29:42.720 --> 00:29:45.720
And meet them as an individual and talk to them to make a difference.

677
00:29:45.800 --> 00:29:47.520
I hope you can do anyway

678
00:29:47.520 --> 00:29:51.560
A small, put a small seed of new thinking or rethink.

679
00:29:51.600 --> 00:29:56.400
Here I do not want to again and encourage you can find these little points where you show

680
00:29:56.400 --> 00:30:01.160
That you can see them as people, as people and then you make a difference.

681
00:30:01.720 --> 00:30:03.520
But thank you very much for the round

682
00:30:03.520 --> 00:30:06.760
Now I'm going to the large kitchen where all the food is made.

683
00:30:07.800 --> 00:30:08.880
Hope it tastes.

684
00:30:08.880 --> 00:30:10.320
Thanks

685
00:30:12.120 --> 00:30:13.000
It is green

686
00:30:13.000 --> 00:30:14.160
It's green now

687
00:30:14.160 --> 00:30:17.640
So now we can go in without any prisoners that we meet

688
00:30:18.440 --> 00:30:21.440
They live here right and left.

689
00:30:21.800 --> 00:30:22.960
Exciting

690
00:30:24.000 --> 00:30:25.760
Strange, why do you have scooters.

691
00:30:25.760 --> 00:30:27.480
Can you get you can get

692
00:30:27.480 --> 00:30:30.400
Can definitely get to test.

693
00:30:30.400 --> 00:30:33.280
Now is really literally in prison.

694
00:30:33.280 --> 00:30:34.760
On a scooter.

695
00:30:34.760 --> 00:30:37.120
Is there anyone who would hurt me if they got the chance

696
00:30:37.120 --> 00:30:38.520
Yes absolutely

697
00:30:38.520 --> 00:30:38.960
Is that so

698
00:30:38.960 --> 00:30:39.720
No.

699
00:30:39.720 --> 00:30:41.240
I do not think so

700
00:30:41.240 --> 00:30:43.680
Then we arrive at this department.

701
00:30:43.680 --> 00:30:45.040
Called Tsyd

702
00:30:45.040 --> 00:30:47.800
But now I go straight into the department.

703
00:30:47.800 --> 00:30:48.240
Yes

704
00:30:48.240 --> 00:30:50.760
Yes, but we go in.

705
00:30:50.760 --> 00:30:53.080
They are certainly great most.

706
00:30:53.080 --> 00:30:53.760
Safe.

707
00:30:55.720 --> 00:30:55.800
Now there were some inmates who saw me

708
00:30:55.800 --> 00:30:59.440
Mauri, Mauri, Mauri, Mauri

709
00:30:59.440 --> 00:31:01.720
Now there were some inmates who saw me

710
00:31:03.360 --> 00:31:04.640
Hello Hello

711
00:31:05.240 --> 00:31:06.960
Oh now they try to get out

712
00:31:06.960 --> 00:31:10.120
I have been noisy so well received somewhere in my life

713
00:31:10.120 --> 00:31:11.880
Hello then, hello then, hello then

714
00:31:11.880 --> 00:31:13.560
Oops that was strange

715
00:31:13.560 --> 00:31:20.600
But we will go on because now we will see how they make the food to 70% of the entire Kumla

716
00:31:20.600 --> 00:31:23.680
And then we have come to Kumla's main kitchen.

717
00:31:23.840 --> 00:31:27.600
Here the food is made to 500 inmates every day.

718
00:31:27.640 --> 00:31:29.520
And he who makes the food his name is Robin.

719
00:31:29.520 --> 00:31:30.760
This is what I look like.
 Thanks.

720
00:31:31.800 --> 00:31:34.040
You thank you for looking like that.

721
00:31:34.040 --> 00:31:35.600
It is still a complainant self -confidence.

722
00:31:35.600 --> 00:31:37.560
Thank you I see it like this.

723
00:31:37.560 --> 00:31:40.560
If people at home imagine some of the most serious criminals

724
00:31:40.560 --> 00:31:44.840
The last 20 years so it is most likely that you have ever cooked the food to them

725
00:31:44.840 --> 00:31:47.160
That's right

726
00:31:47.160 --> 00:31:48.960
Didn't sit down Rakhmat here

727
00:31:48.960 --> 00:31:50.160
Good question.

728
00:31:50.160 --> 00:31:51.320
Maybe you may not say that

729
00:31:51.320 --> 00:31:53.160
No

730
00:31:56.240 --> 00:31:57.840
Now it's done with some rice

731
00:31:57.840 --> 00:31:58.800
What a smooth sound

732
00:31:58.800 --> 00:32:00.840
It is because we can hear and be happy.

733
00:32:00.960 --> 00:32:02.120
So just fiddle

734
00:32:02.120 --> 00:32:04.960
But that is so solemn

735
00:32:04.960 --> 00:32:07.960
Now the rice is ready.

736
00:32:08.000 --> 00:32:10.840
Run a lunch with steak paneng today

737
00:32:10.840 --> 00:32:13.080
Oh it gets a little thai

738
00:32:13.200 --> 00:32:16.200
Now you just go

739
00:32:21.600 --> 00:32:25.320
You have to turn this here.

740
00:32:26.440 --> 00:32:28.920
It feels like it's not you who really decides here.

741
00:32:28.920 --> 00:32:31.920
There is a matriarchate in here

742
00:32:31.920 --> 00:32:35.000

Coconut milk

747
00:32:50.240 --> 00:32:52.920
But is it you who have got Kumla now to start serving

748
00:32:52.920 --> 00:32:54.040
More Thai food

749
00:32:54.040 --> 00:32:55.080

00:32:55.080 --> 00:32:56.800

754
00:33:08.280 --> 00:33:09.520
Pling pling

755
00:33:09.520 --> 00:33:10.920

756
00:33:10.920 --> 00:33:12.160
Pling pling gasket

757
00:33:13.640 --> 00:33:15.600

You get like your lunch box here.

760
00:33:21.400 --> 00:33:24.120
Really reminds you have been shopping at Thai kiosk

761
00:33:24.120 --> 00:33:25.720

762
00:33:25.720 --> 00:33:27.480
She lost interest

763
00:33:29.200 --> 00:33:31.680
Does she always have this much energy iaf

764
00:33:31.680 --> 00:33:32.200
Yes

765
00:33:33.160 --> 00:33:34.160

766
00:33:34.160 --> 00:33:35.240
always.

767
00:33:38.560 --> 00:33:40.520
You have gone to Thailand before too

768
00:33:40.520 --> 00:33:41.520
I watched.

769
00:33:41.520 --> 00:33:43.560
You think I should go to Thailand

770
00:33:43.560 --> 00:33:45.720
No sorry, i mean before

771
00:33:45.720 --> 00:33:47.440
But I've been to Thailand.

772
00:33:47.440 --> 00:33:49.160
Joooo please.

773
00:33:49.160 --> 00:33:52.160
I don't remember please I'm dear now

774
00:33:52.200 --> 00:33:54.480
Are you a girlfriend

775
00:33:55.320 --> 00:33:56.560
How old are you

776
00:33:57.960 --> 00:33:59.880
-—-—-

777
00:33:59.960 --> 00:34:01.280
It is not a girlfriend's age

778
00:34:01.280 --> 00:34:02.640
Jooo

779
00:34:02.640 --> 00:34:04.200
I think you're young.

00:34:04.200 --> 00:34:06.800
Thank you thanks thank you

781
00:34:07.080 --> 00:34:10.840
This is finished food, soon time to drive to them

782
00:34:10.840 --> 00:34:13.360
And this is then the food that I should eat today

783
00:34:13.360 --> 00:34:14.920
Try taste.

784
00:34:14.920 --> 00:34:17.080
If not, don't talk to me.

785
00:34:17.080 --> 00:34:17.880
Will call you.

786
00:34:17.880 --> 00:34:20.880
Is it not good then you may call

787
00:34:21.040 --> 00:34:21.960
Do you know what I really feel.

788
00:34:21.960 --> 00:34:23.120
I will miss you

789
00:34:23.120 --> 00:34:24.560
Me too

790
00:34:24.560 --> 00:34:25.480
I will miss you

791
00:34:25.480 --> 00:34:26.360
Are you tired of me

792
00:34:26.360 --> 00:34:28.080
No, a little

793
00:34:28.080 --> 00:34:28.720
Bye

794
00:34:28.720 --> 00:34:29.440
1, 2, 3

795
00:34:29.440 --> 00:34:30.240
Cape Khun Krap

796
00:34:30.240 --> 00:34:31.640
When I say Cape Khun Krap

797
00:34:31.640 --> 00:34:32.320
If I count

798
00:34:32.320 --> 00:34:33.040
1, 2, 3

799
00:34:33.040 --> 00:34:35.360
When I say Cape Khun Krap, Cape Khun Krap

800
00:34:35.360 --> 00:34:36.280
Look

801
00:34:37.080 --> 00:34:37.800
1, 2, 3

802
00:34:37.800 --> 00:34:38.600
Cape Khun Krap

803
00:34:39.040 --> 00:34:39.840
Cape Khun Krap

804
00:34:40.160 --> 00:34:42.520
Yes good

805
00:34:44.440 --> 00:34:47.080
Last in the competition is thus prison the food.

806
00:34:47.080 --> 00:34:49.560
Will it be able to beat the hospital and school

807
00:34:49.560 --> 00:34:51.680
We'll see that now.

808
00:34:51.680 --> 00:34:54.680
Cheers for a Swedish prison meal 2024.

809
00:34:55.600 --> 00:34:57.440
Thanks so much

810
00:35:01.560 --> 00:35:02.480
This is delicious Robin

811
00:35:02.480 --> 00:35:05.120
So this is a delicious thai stew

812
00:35:05.280 --> 00:35:06.280
Lum pie has done well

813
00:35:06.280 --> 00:35:08.280
Lum pie she is, she is my queen, type

814
00:35:08.400 --> 00:35:09.920
I love her boundless

815
00:35:09.920 --> 00:35:11.320
My queen

816
00:35:11.320 --> 00:35:12.400
You may borrow her if you want.

817
00:35:12.400 --> 00:35:13.920
Oh

818
00:35:13.920 --> 00:35:15.160
What funny that you react

819
00:35:15.160 --> 00:35:18.240
No she is my queen

820
00:35:18.840 --> 00:35:20.520
The punishment is already to sit here on Kumla.

821
00:35:20.520 --> 00:35:22.520
The food can still be very good

822
00:35:22.520 --> 00:35:23.240
I think

823
00:35:23.240 --> 00:35:26.240
It would be strange if you chefs strained you to make bad food,

824
00:35:26.280 --> 00:35:27.560
Yes but it feels a little wrong

825
00:35:27.560 --> 00:35:29.280
is there a limit and you feel like this

826
00:35:29.280 --> 00:35:31.800
Oh, now it was too good we are still a prison.

827
00:35:31.800 --> 00:35:34.200
So i salt in a little extra then

828
00:35:34.200 --> 00:35:34.920
Nothing like that or

829
00:35:34.920 --> 00:35:35.760
Ne

830
00:35:35.760 --> 00:35:38.040
Okay, final grade on this.

831
00:35:38.040 --> 00:35:41.240
I would say that in this context this is up and nos

832
00:35:41.280 --> 00:35:42.360
on a four.

833
00:35:42.360 --> 00:35:47.280
So I may have to go home and think about who is the best.

834
00:35:47.480 --> 00:35:51.200
Prison, school and hospitals thus all land on a 4

835
00:35:51.200 --> 00:35:55.280
But who wins we return to just right

836
00:35:55.280 --> 00:35:58.160
What else do you do in life when you don't cook food to prisoners

837
00:35:58.160 --> 00:36:02.640
Then I take care of my two kids at home and then I am doing some music.

838
00:36:02.640 --> 00:36:04.240
VA

839
00:36:04.240 --> 00:36:05.760
Can Spelalite troubadour and such

840
00:36:05.760 --> 00:36:06.680
Are you a singer

841
00:36:06.680 --> 00:36:07.640
Yes some

842
00:36:07.640 --> 00:36:09.120
What are you?

843
00:36:09.120 --> 00:36:12.360
You understand what this will have to lead to.

844
00:36:12.360 --> 00:36:13.440
I hope you realize

845
00:36:13.440 --> 00:36:14.720
Ne, not sowing singing

846
00:36:14.720 --> 00:36:19.040
I think I read now that you have to sing

847
00:36:19.040 --> 00:36:19.960
No

848
00:36:19.960 --> 00:36:21.760
It won't happen or

849
00:36:21.760 --> 00:36:23.360
There is not a chance.

850
00:36:42.200 --> 00:36:46.000
And in the midst of this wonderful little moment at the prison yard

851
00:36:46.000 --> 00:36:48.560
So it was time for me to decide a winner

852
00:36:48.560 --> 00:36:54.360
And I can say that it was difficult for all the chefs we have met deserves their own tribute

853
00:36:54.360 --> 00:36:56.360
They don't have any magnificent wages.

854
00:36:56.360 --> 00:36:58.440
Many people hardly think that they exist.

855
00:36:58.440 --> 00:37:02.680
Yet they stand out and day in and fight with small budgets

856
00:37:02.920 --> 00:37:07.800
To in their way illuminate the existence of children, pensioners and sick.

857
00:37:09.040 --> 00:37:11.560
But it is a competition and the one that eventually draws

858
00:37:11.560 --> 00:37:15.040
I let the longest straw be surprised by two friends.

859
00:37:15.360 --> 00:37:18.360
Congratulations

860
00:37:18.400 --> 00:37:21.360
But wait it is me

861
00:37:33.120 --> 00:37:34.640
In the big Sweden

862
00:37:34.640 --> 00:37:39.120
Of all the meals that are cooked and that we have won.

863
00:37:39.400 --> 00:37:42.160
Feels huge.

864
00:37:42.160 --> 00:37:45.160
Like having received a Nobel Prize.

865
00:37:45.240 --> 00:37:49.520
I would like to encourage everyone with this one

866
00:37:49.520 --> 00:37:53.640
The benefit to donate a coin to the Child Cancer Foundation.

867
00:37:53.640 --> 00:37:57.360
And of course we will give our profit to the Child Cancer Foundation.
