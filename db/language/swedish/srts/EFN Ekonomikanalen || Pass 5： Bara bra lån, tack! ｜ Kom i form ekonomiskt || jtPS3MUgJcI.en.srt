1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
"The one who is in debt is never free."
 That's how it is.

2
00:00:09,720 --> 00:00:12,800
I have to keep track of my finances now.

3
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:18,240
Mia IngelstrÃ¶m is not only an economist, she is also a personal trainer in economics.

4
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:21,880
Yes, you hear.
 Should we start this?

5
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:32,640
Welcome to Come in shape financially with you and me.

6
00:00:32,720 --> 00:00:39,360
Section loan.
 "Whoever is in debt is never free," I usually say.

7
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:41,640
-Is that so?
 -Yes that's how it is.

8
00:00:41,720 --> 00:00:44,440
-Do you have a loan?
 -Absolutely.

9
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:47,200
-O good or bad?
 -I just have good loans.

10
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:50,320
You could well figure it out ...

11
00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:55,760
Today we will learn about the difference between good and bad loans.

12
00:00:55,840 --> 00:00:59,520
And maybe a little about how to negotiate loans.

13
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:04,400
-It's a little interesting.
 -And many want to know more about tied ...

14
00:01:04,480 --> 00:01:07,600
... and moving, amortization, and how it works.

15
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:11,040
-We have a lot to talk about.
 -Yes, we have to talk quickly.

16
00:01:11,120 --> 00:01:17,080
We start with good and bad loans.
 Surely there are no good loans?

17
00:01:17,160 --> 00:01:20,880
Nice to be debt free and bad to have loans.

18
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:28,600
We start with the bad.
 Bad loans are the ones you take without getting any lasting value.

19
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:36,280
A holiday trip you can't afford.
 You have a more expensive lifestyle than you can afford.

20
00:01:36,360 --> 00:01:40,000
Holiday pictures are no lasting value.

21
00:01:40,080 --> 00:01:45,000
Nor a handbag ... to take out loans to finance a lifestyle.

22
00:01:45,080 --> 00:01:48,560
-Is car loans bad?
 -They may be bad.

23
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:51,000
If you can't afford to buy the car.

24
00:01:51,080 --> 00:01:55,480
Then you sit with a large loan that you have to pay-

25
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:57,760
-and that may be quite high ...

26
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:01,680
-Is good loans?
 -Yes it does.

27
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:06,720
Those loans provide a lasting value.

28
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:10,480
You take something to get something that remains.

29
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:14,240
-Yes, just that ... training is hopefully left.

30
00:02:14,320 --> 00:02:21,200
But if you take student loans to read something you ignore, it's not so good.

31
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:24,480
Something that gives you the opportunity to do something else.

32
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:31,000
Or if you take a mortgage you can buy a place to stay.

33
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:33,200
-Is it a good loan?
 -Absolutely.

34
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:40,360
-The girls get worse interest rates, I read.
 -It's about creditworthiness.

35
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:45,480
Credit rating is a measure of how creditworthy you are.

36
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:51,680
How much you have the opportunity to repay.
 Women often have lower wages.

37
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:58,160
We have looked at that.
 Maybe you are also single ...

38
00:02:58,240 --> 00:03:01,720
Women are more often than men single with children.

39
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:05,760
Then the entire household gets less economic possibilities-

40
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:11,120
-And then the interest rate can be higher, especially on private loans.
 For girls usually interest-

41
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:17,440
-Land some interest points higher because of the creditworthiness.

42
00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:24,000
I have home loans.
 What should I do about it?

43
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:28,720
-Can you do something with it?
 -Yes, you have to get control ...

44
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:36,000
... over what you have.
 You go online at the bank and look at your loan-

45
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:40,480
-and your loan parts.
 The loan can be divided into several parts.

46
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:45,800
And what interest rate do you have?
 How often do you call the bank?

47
00:03:45,880 --> 00:03:50,080
-I called when I took the loan.
 -And how long ago was it?

48
00:03:50,160 --> 00:03:57,760
-17 years ago.
 -Then you can probably negotiate the interest rate.

49
00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:02,400
-You have to act for yourself.
 -How often should you do it?

50
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:09,560
At least once a year.
 To get control of what you have-

51
00:04:09,640 --> 00:04:14,520
-and that you have received the best conditions.
 The house may have risen in value.

52
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:18,560
You may have renovated or can re -evaluate the house.

53
00:04:18,640 --> 00:04:25,840
Maybe you have got a new job with a new salary.
 Or your partner has received a new salary.

54
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:31,040
Hello the bank.
 I want to talk about my interest rate.

55
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:34,520
I have looked a bit and it doesn't seem great.

56
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:40,480
"My house has received a higher valuation. I want to discuss the terms of the loan."

57
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:46,200
Then you have information that the bank receives.

58
00:04:46,280 --> 00:04:50,160
-And then you can have a dialogue about it.
 -How often does this work?

59
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:55,800
Depending on the terms ... Do you have a bound interest rate or moving?

60
00:04:55,880 --> 00:05:00,680
If you have a variable interest rate, you can do so, say twice a year.

61
00:05:00,760 --> 00:05:06,640
-Do I get lower interest rates then?
 -It depends on.
 You don't know that.

62
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:11,480
But the ability to do something is 100 % greater if you hear from you-

63
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:13,960
-An if you don't.

64
00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:18,680
Sure I get lower ... when I haven't heard from myself in 17 years?

65
00:05:18,760 --> 00:05:24,720
You can imagine that.
 And it can be quite a thousand dollars a year.

66
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:28,760
-Do we celebrate with a cup of coffee?
 -Yes we do.

67
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:39,480
-Now I have so many questions about this ... -Yes, drive.

68
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:43,280
-I drive now, so that time is enough.
 -It is good.

69
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:49,480
-What is list interest?
 -The bank's starting price for mortgage rates.

70
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:52,600
Default mode.
 Okay.
 Average interest rate?

71
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:59,400
Interest rates customers have received during the last period.

72
00:05:59,480 --> 00:06:04,920
-The average interest?
 -Yes, with a interest rate on the list interest rate.

73
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:10,880
Comparison sites?
 "We're looking up your interest rates."

74
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:15,440
Or ... "We look up the banks' interest rates and give you the best loans."

75
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:19,440
-Does it work well?
 -They give an indication ...

76
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:25,160
... on how different banks are located.
 And that's good, because then you know about ...

77
00:06:25,240 --> 00:06:29,760
When you call your bank you know what you can ask for-

78
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:32,440
-And which levels are appropriate.

79
00:06:32,520 --> 00:06:39,000
-The they also have owners?
 -If you dial you should be nervous ...

80
00:06:39,080 --> 00:06:43,440
Then it often concerns private loans and maybe SMS loans.
 To take more loans than man ...

81
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:47,600
-What do you like SMS loans?
 -Rate shit.

82
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:50,360
-We should not swear here.
 -Then we don't.

83
00:06:50,440 --> 00:06:53,640
-But then you know what I think.
 -Yes, it was clear.

84
00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:57,960
A viewing question from myself:

85
00:07:00,760 --> 00:07:07,640
"Hello. Should I start amortizing?"

86
00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:12,680
It depends on your life situation.
 We need to know more about your total economy

87
00:07:12,760 --> 00:07:18,160
-To know if it's good or bad.
 But can you not save on other directions-

88
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:22,480
-If you consume what you get, it is better to repay.

89
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:27,480
-Then you save for yourself.
 -Do you know why I don't like to amortize?

90
00:07:27,560 --> 00:07:30,400
Okay, I'm going to repay 2,000 per month.

91
00:07:30,480 --> 00:07:37,800
A lot of money.
 They disappear into the million loan and make no difference.

92
00:07:37,880 --> 00:07:43,520
Do you know you can save them, it might be better to put them into another savings-

93
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:47,720
-which gives you interest or return.
 You invest the money.

94
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:50,400
Do you benefit more from investing?

95
00:07:50,480 --> 00:07:56,200
But then the return must be greater than the interest rate you pay on the loan.

96
00:07:56,280 --> 00:08:02,560
And now, given that interest rates are rising, we have to look more at your economy

97
00:08:02,640 --> 00:08:06,160
-To know whether to amortize or not.

98
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:11,680
-Fast and moving?
 -Fast interest means bound interest rate.

99
00:08:11,760 --> 00:08:16,400
You commit to a certain interest rate for one, two or three years.

100
00:08:16,480 --> 00:08:21,200
-The motion rate changes every three months.
 -What do you like the most?

101
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:25,440
Variable interest rates have been cheaper for long periods.

102
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:29,360
-But you should be able to sleep well at night ... -is in your stomach ...

103
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:36,400
And you must afford interest rates as they rise.

104
00:08:36,480 --> 00:08:40,080
-The interest rate queen.
 -The interest rate queen ... oh.

105
00:08:40,160 --> 00:08:43,800
You know everything ... I usually say: And what have we learned today?

106
00:08:43,880 --> 00:08:47,720
-For a lot, it's not possible ... -But try.

107
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:52,200
-I will help you.
 -I have learned about loans.
 Have a good one.

108
00:08:52,280 --> 00:08:56,320
What we have to remember is that SMS loans are pure shit.

109
00:08:56,400 --> 00:08:59,240
-We don't swear, I said so.
 -No, okay then ...

110
00:08:59,320 --> 00:09:01,320
SMS loans are boring.

111
00:09:01,400 --> 00:09:04,280
Call and talk to the bank.
 The second thing.
