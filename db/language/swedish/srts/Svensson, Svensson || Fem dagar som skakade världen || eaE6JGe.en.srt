1
00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:55.960
- Sites it well in the back?
 - Giant, old man.

2
00:00:56.120 --> 00:01:01.760
- Why are you going to have a ball?
 - It's tradition!

3
00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:08.760
- I remember my first bale.
 Lovely!
 - Where did you meet Dad?

4
00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:12.600
Get it together!

5
00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:20.000
I was actually there with dad, on the school ball.
 I was wearing a blue dress.

6
00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:25.000
- Dad had a sailor costume.
 - Sjöman costume?

7
00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:31.400
He did the lump in the fleet and could not afford a coat.

8
00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:40.080
- You would arrange dinner.
 - I've done more important things.

9
00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:46.880
I have made my banner for the first train.
 What do you say?

10
00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:53.680
- You do not complicate it ... - Now the director's pack will be fit!

11
00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:57.440
Do you have to walk in the train?

12
00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:03.360
It is Sweden's biggest holiday.

13
00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:10.160
Then we stand united and strong and you go out of the houses for our ideals.

14
00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:17.200
- And there is free coffee in the square ... - it's about solidarity!

15
00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:24.200
I'm probably the only one in the family who selflessly puts up on others!

16
00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:27.800
- Do I get half?
 -No.

17
00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:34.880
May 1st is for you and your friends to feel important.

18
00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:40.840
It is in the broad layers that the knowledge exists.

19
00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:47.600
Remove all managers for a month, - no one would notice anything.

20
00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:55.560
- So it's not noticeable if I'm gone?
 - You do some kind of benefit sometimes.

21
00:02:55.720 --> 00:03:03.360
But take Melander - my boss.
 Now he is going on a luxury course again.
 Shameful!

22
00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:09.960
- So it didn't sound when you were on course.
 - We got something done!

23
00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:16.560
- You won the tip walk!
 - And finished second in the karaoke competition.

24
00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:21.160
The post can do without Melander.

25
00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:28.440
You are jealous.
 Melander is good.
 - Jump down, and we'll see ...

26
00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:37.520
-How nice you look!
 Is there anything going on?
 - It's a bale, I've said.

27
00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:44.320
- You were invited by little Roger, huh?
 - Patrik.
 His name is Patrik.

28
00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:49.400
Roger is ten years old and collects frogs.

29
00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:57.000
- What fun that Patrik offered you!
 - Strange.
 He looks normal.

30
00:03:57.160 --> 00:04:03.400
Add, max.
 Follow!
 I have to have someone to train drums with.

31
00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:08.000
- Mom, say something!
 - Help your sister.

32
00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:13.480
- She can help you with something she can.
 -What then?

33
00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:18.000
Chewing chewing gum, read the Weekly Review ...

34
00:04:21.920 --> 00:04:27.200
- Are you our first ball?
 - It was nice.

35
00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:34.800
Then you were nervous.
 I asked your father for permission to escort you to the ball.

36
00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:41.520
- What was he saying?
 - "May I see you again ..."

37
00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:48.520
- But you ignored that. - Yes!
 Because I loved you!

38
00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:56.560
Should I cook dinner, vacuuming and disk -

39
00:04:56.720 --> 00:05:01.120
- Or go away and play poker?

40
00:05:01.280 --> 00:05:04.920
I just wanted to check out.

41
00:05:09.760 --> 00:05:16.480
Where is Dad somewhere?
 He would drive us to school.

42
00:05:16.640 --> 00:05:21.960
He cycles with the post.
 Something has emerged.

43
00:05:22.120 --> 00:05:27.560
- A tractor ... - have you read the test?

44
00:05:27.720 --> 00:05:31.360
-Yes!
 -Is it true?

45
00:05:31.520 --> 00:05:36.360
- The truth is relative.
 - It is concrete:

46
00:05:36.520 --> 00:05:43.080
If you have not read the test, you will be adopted.

47
00:05:43.240 --> 00:05:50.200
-Finally!
 We'll be too late!
 - ATTACK, wait, wait, wait ...

48
00:05:50.360 --> 00:05:57.000
- Melander is gone now this week.
 - The children have to go ...

49
00:05:57.160 --> 00:06:04.560
Guess ... Guess who he has appointed his deputy manager.

50
00:06:04.720 --> 00:06:10.840
- It's not true ... - Yes!
 - Children, your dad is the manager!

51
00:06:15.680 --> 00:06:22.520
- Do you understand what this means?
 -Yes.
 Vivalla will be without mail.

52
00:06:22.680 --> 00:06:29.880
Go out, I have to talk to dad.
 - Have you thought through this?

53
00:06:30.040 --> 00:06:36.280
It is a week.
 Melander has prepared everything.

54
00:06:36.440 --> 00:06:42.680
- It takes care of itself.
 - Why are you going to be a manager?

55
00:06:42.840 --> 00:06:49.200
- There is fun!
 - You get any longer there without compensation!

56
00:06:50.360 --> 00:06:54.800
I get some managerial privileges.

57
00:06:54.960 --> 00:06:59.680
- The key to the candy machine.
 - Gustav!

58
00:06:59.840 --> 00:07:05.120
Yes, yes ... now I have to try everything I wanted.

59
00:07:05.280 --> 00:07:12.920
- Sita in Melander's room and sleep?
 - Feel what it's like to be a manager!

60
00:07:13.080 --> 00:07:20.320
- You said managers were superfluous.
 - I was slightly categorical ...

61
00:07:20.480 --> 00:07:27.840
I've never tried.
 I was not elected student council chairman.

62
00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:33.960
It was a difference.
 They wanted someone who was a little more ...

63
00:07:34.120 --> 00:07:37.760
-What then?
 -Normal.

64
00:07:37.920 --> 00:07:42.960
I had a clear political will!

65
00:07:43.120 --> 00:07:49.400
You roared, "Vote for me and you should be liberated!"

66
00:07:49.560 --> 00:07:55.120
It was such times!
 Che Guevara, Student Revolution ...

67
00:07:55.280 --> 00:08:00.720
- Do you recover 20 years of disappointment?
 -No.

68
00:08:00.880 --> 00:08:05.240
I think I can achieve something.

69
00:08:07.240 --> 00:08:13.880
Congratulations then, the postmaster!
 But now the kids are waiting in the car ...

70
00:08:14.040 --> 00:08:21.680
Let them wait.
 I will call home and tell me that I have become a manager.

71
00:08:21.840 --> 00:08:24.480
Mother...

72
00:08:30.120 --> 00:08:36.360
-Hello boss?
 Did they obey you?
 - It was a bit sneaky.

73
00:08:36.520 --> 00:08:43.600
But thanks to my experience, I was able to quickly solve the problem.

74
00:08:43.760 --> 00:08:50.320
- A strap loosened from a bag.
 - I don't think you are a manager!

75
00:08:50.480 --> 00:08:54.480
Strange things have happened.

76
00:08:54.640 --> 00:09:01.040
Yes, there will be some talking pig somewhere in the United States.

77
00:09:01.200 --> 00:09:08.040
Are you not proud of me?
 I got a trust assignment too.

78
00:09:08.200 --> 00:09:14.320
- To fill in toilet paper?
 - Looking through this one.

79
00:09:14.480 --> 00:09:18.920
- And that was important.
 -What is it?

80
00:09:19.080 --> 00:09:24.920
I haven't listed that yet.
 I may ask mom.

81
00:09:25.080 --> 00:09:31.800
- How does it go with the bale?
 - I and Patrik - that's too good ...

82
00:09:31.960 --> 00:09:37.760
Think positive!
 Look at me, just.
 Now I'm the manager!

83
00:09:37.920 --> 00:09:41.760
Soon you will be a postman again.

84
00:09:41.920 --> 00:09:49.560
I haven't dared to say a word to Patrik - and then he invites me!

85
00:09:49.720 --> 00:09:57.440
- As long as you don't talk, you're okay!
 - Max, be kind to your sister!

86
00:09:57.600 --> 00:10:01.240
Sorry ... do you want?

87
00:10:03.080 --> 00:10:09.800
Watch, the boss sits and reconscents.
 How has it gone for you?

88
00:10:09.960 --> 00:10:15.400
- Good, just good.
 –Okey, Max.
 Now you have to lead.

89
00:10:15.560 --> 00:10:22.800
- You dance in the wrong direction all the time!
 - It's your duty to bring me right!

90
00:10:22.960 --> 00:10:30.240
Funny that no gems came away, that no paper got stuck in the copier ...

91
00:10:30.400 --> 00:10:35.840
Stop teasing!
 Melander gave me an important assignment.

92
00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:39.840
I haven't realized what.

93
00:10:41.960 --> 00:10:49.320
This is a regular work schedule.
 It is needed for salary payment.

94
00:10:49.480 --> 00:10:56.120
My salary is in the account every month.
 That's all you have to know.

95
00:10:56.280 --> 00:11:01.200
- I go through this for you.
 -Thanks.

96
00:11:01.360 --> 00:11:05.920
-Where are you going?
 - At the Grand Meeting.

97
00:11:06.080 --> 00:11:13.760
Melander sometimes has.
 He goes through what can be improved ...

98
00:11:13.920 --> 00:11:21.040
- I have some thoughts and ideas ... - Don't make up now, Gustav.

99
00:11:21.200 --> 00:11:28.920
You will be boss all your life.
 I just want to take the opportunity to enjoy.

100
00:11:29.080 --> 00:11:36.080
-Okay, I understand.
 Take care, you!
 - It's a black limousine outside!

101
00:11:36.240 --> 00:11:42.800
- Do you feel for something about it?
 - No, I ordered a white.

102
00:11:43.960 --> 00:11:50.480
- But it rolls well anyway.
 Bye!
 - Mom, you have to ...

103
00:11:50.640 --> 00:11:58.080
I know what to say!
 Now it's Monday.
 On Friday it is as usual.

104
00:11:58.240 --> 00:12:02.280
-See you then!
 -Good luck!

105
00:12:09.960 --> 00:12:16.200
- How is the election training going?
 - They are in the fine.

106
00:12:16.360 --> 00:12:20.200
Kossa you can be yourself!

107
00:12:20.360 --> 00:12:27.800
- Gustav seems to thrive in the managerial role.
 - He goes around in limousine and waves.

108
00:12:28.640 --> 00:12:35.280
Yes, it's ridiculous.
 But it's fun to go in it.
 It has everything.

109
00:12:35.440 --> 00:12:40.880
Yesterday we watched TV and ate salty sticks.

110
00:12:41.040 --> 00:12:48.640
- Isn't it expensive with driver?
 - Yes, but it is Gustav who pays.

111
00:12:48.800 --> 00:12:53.240
Tomorrow is the postal cycle again ...

112
00:12:53.400 --> 00:13:00.240
He is doing right.
 Far too few dare to live out their dreams.

113
00:13:00.400 --> 00:13:08.240
- I wrote a poem about it once ... - I think Lena understands the message.

114
00:13:09.360 --> 00:13:14.560
Nämen ... you will be the queen of the ball!

115
00:13:14.720 --> 00:13:20.560
- Mitt necklace fits perfectly!
 - Patrik is coming soon.

116
00:13:20.720 --> 00:13:26.280
- Have you seen my gold earrings?
 - I will see what I have.

117
00:13:26.440 --> 00:13:32.240
-How does it feel?
 - Maybe you should stay home ...

118
00:13:32.400 --> 00:13:38.920
- Yes, a new dick begins.
 - Lina probably doesn't mean seriously.

119
00:13:49.320 --> 00:13:53.560
- Health the family!
 - thank you, director.

120
00:13:53.720 --> 00:14:00.200
- Are our nice neighbors here?
 - Wogs up nice clothes!

121
00:14:00.360 --> 00:14:06.360
-Thanks.
 Pure wool.
 - I thought you loved your uniform.

122
00:14:06.520 --> 00:14:13.480
Last week!
 If you want to get somewhere, you have to dare to develop.

123
00:14:13.640 --> 00:14:18.560
These I think fit ... - But Gustav!

124
00:14:20.440 --> 00:14:26.080
-You look nice!
 - Have you never seen a suit before?

125
00:14:26.240 --> 00:14:29.880
Yes, but never on you.

126
00:14:30.040 --> 00:14:35.840
Now we have to go.
 - Gustav, we got no post this morning.

127
00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:40.440
Rune has not received post in several days.

128
00:14:40.600 --> 00:14:48.040
- I must punish the culprit.
 - Easch, we will surely get it tomorrow.

129
00:14:52.200 --> 00:15:00.200
You are very cute!
 Do you want something?
 Money, sweets, wisdom?
 Tut!

130
00:15:00.360 --> 00:15:05.400
Patrik is here!
 What should I do?

131
00:15:05.560 --> 00:15:10.600
- A tip is to go out and say hello.
 - Good idea.

132
00:15:10.760 --> 00:15:16.720
-Bye Bye.
 If you want to be picked up, call!

133
00:15:16.880 --> 00:15:20.520
I send Karlsson!

134
00:15:24.680 --> 00:15:30.760
You are good looking in a suit.
 You should have that more often.

135
00:15:30.920 --> 00:15:38.600
- For 4,000 you get some quality.
 –4,000?
 Can you afford it?

136
00:15:38.760 --> 00:15:46.280
- There is a lot of money on the post!
 - ART ... what are you saying?

137
00:15:46.440 --> 00:15:50.880
There is a lot of money on the post.

138
00:15:51.040 --> 00:15:56.400
The manager cannot walk around in a uniform.

139
00:15:56.560 --> 00:16:04.000
- Gustav, have you taken money?!
 - Melander was very clear, he said:

140
00:16:04.160 --> 00:16:11.640
- Use resources to their own head.
 - And tomorrow he chops off it!

141
00:16:11.800 --> 00:16:19.640
It's not that dangerous.
 It is well deductible, something that managers have ...

142
00:16:19.800 --> 00:16:23.400
You can get fired!

143
00:16:23.560 --> 00:16:30.800
Take it easy.
 Melander encourages private ideas.
 He becomes happy.

144
00:16:30.960 --> 00:16:37.520
Look at me.
 Do you really think that Melander will be happy?

145
00:16:38.680 --> 00:16:44.520
Happy may not be the right word.
 But a little surprised!

146
00:16:52.080 --> 00:16:58.840
- It always goes overboard.
 -Sorry.
 I rushed away.

147
00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:03.440
You would just make sure everything floated.

148
00:17:03.600 --> 00:17:08.040
I know, but I was so inspired.

149
00:17:08.200 --> 00:17:14.840
When I entered the office, I felt that everything was possible.

150
00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:19.440
It costs you your savings capital.

151
00:17:19.600 --> 00:17:26.600
You talk about the honest employee - and then you behave like this!

152
00:17:26.760 --> 00:17:32.600
I have tried to pursue an active personnel policy.

153
00:17:32.760 --> 00:17:38.600
If you knew what I've invested in the staff!

154
00:17:38.760 --> 00:17:46.200
I have ordered a mini golf course and I have bought a courtyard.

155
00:17:46.360 --> 00:17:52.200
-What did you say?
 - A mini golf course and a courtyard.

156
00:17:52.360 --> 00:17:58.400
Gustav, tomorrow you cancel the track, and sell the farm.

157
00:17:58.560 --> 00:18:06.320
- Then we can only pray to God!
 - I wonder if one's God can help.

158
00:18:06.480 --> 00:18:12.920
The staff has been a bit off.
 They have resigned.

159
00:18:13.080 --> 00:18:17.640
Have they resigned?
 How many?

160
00:18:17.800 --> 00:18:21.600
42 with the caretaker.

161
00:18:21.760 --> 00:18:27.600
Do you mean that all employees in the post have resigned?

162
00:18:27.760 --> 00:18:35.840
They got annoyed when I changed a bit and wanted them to rotate.

163
00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:40.640
-"Rotate"?
 - Switch task.

164
00:18:40.800 --> 00:18:48.360
Pettersson got to try something new.
 The guys were allowed to sit in the cash register.

165
00:18:49.520 --> 00:18:53.960
The part -time stands got the morning tours.

166
00:18:54.120 --> 00:19:01.480
- Is that no one got any post?
 - People may write fewer letters!

167
00:19:01.640 --> 00:19:09.080
- How much mail has not been distributed?
 - I made an estimate this morning ...

168
00:19:09.240 --> 00:19:13.080
–Inchy ... and ... –What?

169
00:19:13.240 --> 00:19:18.000
–4,000 letters, 250 packages.
 -Where are you going?

170
00:19:18.160 --> 00:19:23.280
- I have eleven hours - I have time.
 -No...

171
00:19:23.440 --> 00:19:27.040
Nobody can!

172
00:19:27.200 --> 00:19:32.000
I may be the world's worst manager -

173
00:19:32.160 --> 00:19:36.600
- But is a seven -half postman!

174
00:19:42.320 --> 00:19:48.160
8,000 people have gathered at Norra Bantorget.

175
00:19:48.320 --> 00:19:54.160
The LO manager gives speeches at 15. We will return then.

176
00:19:54.320 --> 00:19:58.160
-Where is Dad?
 - Hos Melander.

177
00:19:58.320 --> 00:20:05.480
- Melander is pretty angry, huh?
 - If he does not, we must look in the lake.

178
00:20:05.640 --> 00:20:10.280
Do not be sad.
 Rals is difficult.

179
00:20:10.440 --> 00:20:17.880
It's Max's wrong!
 Had I had some good to practice, it would never have happened!

180
00:20:18.040 --> 00:20:25.080
- Small accidents happen constantly.
 - But not everyone tear the buffet table ...

181
00:20:27.400 --> 00:20:31.840
I didn't think he would let me go.

182
00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:39.440
- Not those who took roast beef either ... - didn't you get any more dance with Patrik?

183
00:20:39.600 --> 00:20:47.040
He offered ... but I didn't want to ruin the coat with potato salad.

184
00:20:47.200 --> 00:20:51.320
Gustav ... how has it been?

185
00:20:51.480 --> 00:20:59.320
Melander was impressed that I distributed 4,000 letters in 11 hours.

186
00:20:59.480 --> 00:21:03.880
- What did he say about the other?
 -Which?

187
00:21:04.040 --> 00:21:08.520
- That 42 people resigned ... - he touched it a little neighbor.

188
00:21:08.680 --> 00:21:14.320
-What did he say then?
 –Fa see ... it was a lot ...

189
00:21:14.480 --> 00:21:19.920
The keywords were fools, kill ...

190
00:21:20.080 --> 00:21:25.280
... repeated again and move from Vivalla.

191
00:21:25.440 --> 00:21:32.680
But my work schedule was the best and most thoughtful he has seen.

192
00:21:32.840 --> 00:21:39.320
–Wh's work schedule?
 - Mitt ... our ... okay - yours.

193
00:21:39.480 --> 00:21:44.920
- Health and thank you.
 -Now I have to go.

194
00:21:45.080 --> 00:21:51.120
- You have cycled ten miles.
 -It does not matter.

195
00:21:51.280 --> 00:21:57.920
My workmates are waiting for the square and then I line up!

196
00:21:58.080 --> 00:22:04.920
- What should we do with him?
 - They lower shark cages in the ocean ...

197
00:22:05.080 --> 00:22:10.720
If there is a batter he is bad out ...

198
00:22:12.680 --> 00:22:15.520
Lina Svensson.

199
00:22:17.280 --> 00:22:20.800
Yes, okay.

200
00:22:25.640 --> 00:22:31.480
- It was Patrik.
 - Yeah ... are you going to pay the dry cleaning?

201
00:22:31.640 --> 00:22:37.480
-No.
 He wonders if we should be together.
 - What did you say then?

202
00:22:39.280 --> 00:22:45.120
-I do not know.
 Heard anyone what I said?
 -No sorry...

203
00:22:45.280 --> 00:22:48.280
I have to call ...

204
00:22:48.440 --> 00:22:52.800
How fun!
 Have you met Patrik?

205
00:22:52.960 --> 00:23:00.800
Gustav hit him in the head with a stone when he palled apples.

206
00:23:00.960 --> 00:23:08.040
- Hi, have you forgotten something?
 - I stand over this year's first train.

207
00:23:08.200 --> 00:23:15.000
- You were waiting for the square.
 - They waited outside.

208
00:23:15.160 --> 00:23:19.400
Shouldn't you join them?

209
00:23:19.560 --> 00:23:25.400
They have a banner that I can't put on.

210
00:23:25.560 --> 00:23:30.000
"Death to the overflower Gustav Svensson!"

211
00:23:30.160 --> 00:23:33.960
We hide in the basement!

212
00:24:11.520 --> 00:24:14.360
