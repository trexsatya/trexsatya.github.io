00:00:00,820 --> 00:00:08,820
Perhaps the most famous of the nature philosophers is Pythagoras, which lived about 570-500 BC.

2
00:00:09,640 --> 00:00:17,880
He was born on the island of Samos off Turkey's west coast, received a good education and studied philosophy under Thales, among others.

3
00:00:18,440 --> 00:00:25,380
At his call, Pythagoras as a 20-year-old went to Egypt to study, among other things, mathematics.

4
00:00:25,820 --> 00:00:34,860
Among the lessons of the trip are what we today feel like Pythagora's kit - A2 B2 C2.

5
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:37,920
But Pythago's thinking went beyond that.

6
00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:46,000
Like the other natural philosophers, Pythagoras were busy with the idea of finding everything's origin, a matter.

7
00:00:46,400 --> 00:00:53,440
Where Thales said that everything's origin is water, Pythagoras meant that everything is speech.

8
00:00:53,760 --> 00:01:00,280
He meant that the universe is made up of integers and that nothing can exist without a number.

9
00:01:00,580 --> 00:01:05,180
Everything is speech, and the key to understanding them goes through mathematics.

10
00:01:05,460 --> 00:01:12,440
The starting shot for Pythagora's philosophy is believed to have been his discovery of mathematical relationships in music

11
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:17,920
- that some sound frequencies are in nature harmonizing better than others.

12
00:01:18,440 --> 00:01:24,620
He meant that because the relationship between tones can be expressed as speech and speech conditions

13
00:01:24,660 --> 00:01:28,660
It should also be possible to describe everything else in the world in this way.

14
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:35,340
Even more convinced he became when he discovered what we today call the golden incision

15
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:40,780
- A mathematical proportion found in many of nature's creations.

16
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:49,140
In order to explore the relationship of mathematics to reality, he founded a philosophical-religious school

17
00:01:49,240 --> 00:01:53,380
which he uncommonly named after himself - Pythagoreans.

18
00:01:54,040 --> 00:02:03,820
These studied mathematics and numerology, and their goal was to be able to say something about our world through abstract thinking.

19
00:02:04,360 --> 00:02:10,200
This was the first time math is used for more than practical count

20
00:02:10,340 --> 00:02:14,460
- Something that had a huge importance for future science.

21
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:18,160
As a pythagorÃ©, one would indulge in philosophy.

22
00:02:18,900 --> 00:02:25,260
In order to be accepted as one of Pythagora's disciples, one underwent an intake test

23
00:02:25,260 --> 00:02:28,560
Which was about not having to say a word for five years.

24
00:02:29,060 --> 00:02:34,020
You only had to listen to what the full pythagores had to say.

25
00:02:34,665 --> 00:02:41,125
Then one would follow strict living rules to focus on mathematics.

26
00:02:41,580 --> 00:02:49,120
Among other things, it was never possible to pick up a dropped object, touching white chickens,

27
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:55,840
stir in the fire with iron objects, speak in darkness, raise animals with crooked chlorine,

28
00:02:55,900 --> 00:03:02,780
Break bread, step over the fence, pick flower bouquets or hike along a country road.

29
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:09,900
These rules were a way for the Pythagoreans to maintain and demonstrate self -control.

30
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:14,160
They lived together and had no personal possessions.

31
00:03:14,780 --> 00:03:19,960
Among the more philosophically influenced rules, strict vegetarianism applied.

32
00:03:20,220 --> 00:03:27,400
This when Pythagoras believed in self -hike and meant that one could be reborn like any animal.

33
00:03:27,740 --> 00:03:31,180
Eating animals was therefore the same as eating people.

34
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:34,920
But most important of all was to avoid beans.

35
00:03:35,300 --> 00:03:40,580
He had calculated that it is 216 years between each reincarnation,

36
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:45,200
and in between, our soul had to be stored somewhere

37
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:50,660
- And beans were nothing but containers for dormant souls.

38
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:56,780
Pythagoras was also the first with the idea that the earth was round and revolved around the sun,

39
00:03:56,780 --> 00:04:00,880
The universe spherical and the planets of the planets circular.

40
00:04:01,380 --> 00:04:09,080
This idea meant that one could now start calculating and predicting the movements and positions of the celestial bodies.

41
00:04:09,700 --> 00:04:14,640
That people in the Middle Ages would believe that the earth was flat is a so -called factoid -

42
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:19,460
A performance held for true but which is in fact incorrect.

43
00:04:20,020 --> 00:04:31,160
Already a few hundred years after Pythagoras, another Greek philosopher, Eratosthenes, the earth's circumference to 46,620 \ hkm.

44
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:35,520
Today we know that the circumference of the earth is 40,075 km

45
00:04:35,700 --> 00:04:40,840
So it was certainly not a bad calculation given that it was over 2000 years ago.

46
00:04:41,260 --> 00:04:49,360
When Nicolaus Copernicus in 1543 describes the heliocentric worldview (that the sun is at the center)

47
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:58,020
He himself calls the theory "Astronomia Pythagorica" as a tribute to Pythagora's theory that has now finally been proven.

48
00:04:58,340 --> 00:05:04,600
For outsiders probably appeared the activities of the Pythagores as something very peculiar

49
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:08,200
and was considered with great suspicion.

50
00:05:08,620 --> 00:05:12,840
According to the myth, Pythagoras came to be feared by the local population

51
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:19,460
which eventually came to rebelling when they feared he was engaged in black art.

52
00:05:20,540 --> 00:05:26,600
Pythagoras must have moved for his life, chased, after which he reached a large prayer field.

53
00:05:27,020 --> 00:05:33,900
Instead of trampling on the sacred beans, he must have stopped and awaited the persecutors and death.

54
00:05:34,480 --> 00:05:41,020
In fact, we still have a reference to Pythagoras "Black Art" in popular culture

55
00:05:41,300 --> 00:05:45,480
- Namely the pentagram or the "devil mark".

56
00:05:45,880 --> 00:05:51,240
This brand was originally the symbol or "logo of the Pythagores".

57
00:05:51,780 --> 00:05:55,940
In summary, Pythagora's influence has been great.

58
00:05:56,280 --> 00:06:02,200
He was the first Western mathematician and has contributed a number of mathematical ideas,

59
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:12,360
This includes the idea of a speech's "square" and "cube" and the application of geometric concepts in mathematics.

60
00:06:13,080 --> 00:06:21,400
But even more important was that he realized that mathematics and abstract thinking could be used to understand

61
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:27,740
and describe the world - an insight that Plato came to build on 150 years later,

62
00:06:28,060 --> 00:06:32,180
And an insight that is fundamental to all modern science.

63
00:06:33,820 --> 00:06:42,300
Finally, it was also Pythagoras that named both philosophy (which means "love for wisdom")

64
00:06:42,300 --> 00:06:48,520
As mathematics (which means "science") - name we obviously use today.

65
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:56,660
In addition, he should have been one of the first to argue that thinking originates from the brain

66
00:06:56,660 --> 00:06:59,500
And not from the heart as you thought earlier.

67
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:02,480
In other words, an impressive summary.
