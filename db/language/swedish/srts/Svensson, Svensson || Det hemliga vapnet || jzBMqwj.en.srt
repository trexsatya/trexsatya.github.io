1
00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:56.280
Mountain chain sharing Spain and France?

2
00:00:56.440 --> 00:01:03.600
-Wake!
 It is almost half past eleven!
 - I never want to wake up again.

3
00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:10.200
- I understand that you are partying, but ... - we celebrated the victory.

4
00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:17.840
We have the chance to win the series.
 Then you have to have a beer with the guys.

5
00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:22.840
It goes quite quietly to nowadays.

6
00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:29.640
You came home at four, screamed "punishment" and kicked out the toaster.

7
00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:37.240
It was perhaps later than normal.
 But you didn't come to the match.

8
00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:44.360
- You didn't meet us at the train station.
 - So Satan?
 How did you get home?

9
00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:50.640
- We got a lift with the book bus.
 - There you see that it is needed!

10
00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:59.640
I go into a tunnel of free kicks - variants ... I forgot to pick you up.

11
00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:07.440
- You must never put a free kick.
 - It does not belong to my information.

12
00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:13.240
- No, you cool the drinks.
 - It's more than that!

13
00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:18.280
I wash the sweaters, sell programs ...

14
00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:22.680
In the corporate you got to play.

15
00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:29.480
I've always dreamed of being in a real series.

16
00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:34.280
And the way there is to cool the drinks?

17
00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:39.040
Ralf Edström started the same way!

18
00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:43.040
Yes, but then he was nine years old.

19
00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:50.840
Yes, yes ... but you don't know what I know.

20
00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:58.440
- I might be allowed to work out.
 - What do you have to do to get it?

21
00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:05.120
Just put up for the team.
 Like a kind of spiritual father.

22
00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:12.040
- Mascot, you mean?
 - I should keep people in a good mood!

23
00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:25.480
That you would sink so low, Gustav, I didn't think so.

24
00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:31.080
I'm actually surprised myself.

25
00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:39.720
- This is not toxic, huh?
 -Try!

26
00:03:40.960 --> 00:03:49.480
Don't have a fun.
 Have you heard the story of the boy who shouted "the wolf is coming"?

27
00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:54.480
- Yes, but you seem to want to take it again.
 -Yes.

28
00:03:54.640 --> 00:04:02.080
Some wolves would guard a boy ... The boy was looking for a wolf ...

29
00:04:03.320 --> 00:04:09.560
- Take another fairy tale instead.
 -Yes.
 Lets see...

30
00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:15.560
Once in Spain, a sailor and a whore ... met ...

31
00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:20.880
- Göran!
 - Tell a fairy tale yourself then!

32
00:04:21.040 --> 00:04:26.760
- Hallo!
 - Göran tells a fairy tale from Spain.

33
00:04:26.920 --> 00:04:29.760
Quiet, Max!

34
00:04:29.920 --> 00:04:35.760
Have you asked Dad about the guinea pig?
 I get it for ten kronor.

35
00:04:35.920 --> 00:04:41.760
Oh, guinea pigs!
 - It's the world's best pets.

36
00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:48.960
- There you hear!
 I want one.
 - Dad "is allergic to fur animals".

37
00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:54.120
- Why does he dress as a rabbit?
 -Did you see that?

38
00:04:54.280 --> 00:04:59.920
- It saw the whole Vivalla.
 - He was with us too.

39
00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:04.720
- Did he have the costume on his mind all the time?
 -Yes.

40
00:05:04.880 --> 00:05:10.040
Berglund's kids bands fixed cans in the tail.

41
00:05:10.200 --> 00:05:17.640
- Göran and Annika, thanks for yesterday.
 - You seem to have had a fun evening.

42
00:05:17.800 --> 00:05:25.240
Vivalla IF - what a bunch!
 You will not find such a friendship on the construction!

43
00:05:25.400 --> 00:05:32.520
- It's hard to compare.
 - Build houses don't require much ...

44
00:05:32.680 --> 00:05:40.120
- I don't really agree with that.
 - Football is about something from within ...

45
00:05:40.280 --> 00:05:44.720
What should I call it?
 Soul, maybe.

46
00:05:46.080 --> 00:05:50.280
- Göran ... - what did I say?

47
00:05:50.440 --> 00:05:57.080
It may not matter what you say.
 People go anyway.

48
00:05:57.240 --> 00:06:00.880
I'll explain later.

49
00:06:02.640 --> 00:06:08.480
- Dad ... what about the guinea pig?
 - Don't work now.

50
00:06:08.640 --> 00:06:16.080
A pet is just like a child - it needs love and care.

51
00:06:16.240 --> 00:06:20.800
I have managed without stuff there!

52
00:06:20.960 --> 00:06:27.720
Max, listen to your dad now.
 If I say this ... then ...

53
00:06:27.880 --> 00:06:31.720
You don't get a fucking guinea pig.

54
00:06:38.680 --> 00:06:44.240
Thanks Dad.
 You are the nicest in the world.

55
00:06:44.400 --> 00:06:52.320
- What should it be hot then?
 - The condition was that I had to choose.

56
00:06:52.480 --> 00:06:58.400
Stop!
 You can't call a guinea pig for Ove Rainer.

57
00:06:58.560 --> 00:07:04.400
Why not?
 He underwent very undeserved suffering.

58
00:07:04.560 --> 00:07:11.320
- He deserves redress.
 - As a guinea pig is baptized after him?

59
00:07:11.480 --> 00:07:18.000
Max was not called Ove.
 It's my turn to decide names!

60
00:07:18.160 --> 00:07:22.880
I go shopping.
 You cook dinner.

61
00:07:23.040 --> 00:07:29.560
Can't Max do it?
 He is just playing and catering ...

62
00:07:29.720 --> 00:07:35.720
-I am twelve years old.
 Then you are cuddly.
 - There may be boundaries.

63
00:07:35.880 --> 00:07:43.360
You should be grateful for the guinea pig.
 Show that you are mature that responsibility.

64
00:07:43.520 --> 00:07:48.960
Obvious.
 I'll just check out Kalle's bike.

65
00:07:49.120 --> 00:07:56.160
This is what could not happen.
 You would take care of the guinea pig.

66
00:07:56.320 --> 00:08:03.960
Hi, you probably had a guinea pig.
 - Oh, what a cute!
 What should it be hot?

67
00:08:04.120 --> 00:08:07.960
- Ove Rainer.
 -How cute!

68
00:08:08.120 --> 00:08:15.240
- Göran got strange yesterday ... - Yes, he was unusually rude.

69
00:08:15.400 --> 00:08:19.640
I intend to offer coffee!

70
00:08:19.800 --> 00:08:27.600
Göran played in the junior national team in football, but then he got an injury.

71
00:08:27.760 --> 00:08:34.000
He got his knee destroyed in a match but it did not heal.

72
00:08:34.160 --> 00:08:40.000
- What did you say first?
 - He played in the junior national team.

73
00:08:40.760 --> 00:08:49.000
Has Göran Forslund in the house next door played football in the junior national team?

74
00:08:49.160 --> 00:08:52.320
Yes.

75
00:08:52.480 --> 00:08:58.280
- What year?
 - When it could have been?
 1979 ...

76
00:08:58.440 --> 00:09:03.600
Now let's see ... well, tighten ...!
 Here he is!

77
00:09:03.760 --> 00:09:11.280
- Göran Forslund, No. 7, right -hander.
 - I have never seen the picture ...

78
00:09:11.440 --> 00:09:17.480
"Forslund is predicted to be our next big football export."

79
00:09:17.640 --> 00:09:24.360
"Such a goalkeeper has not been seen since Gunnar Nordahl's days."

80
00:09:25.960 --> 00:09:29.600
44 goals in one season?!

81
00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:43.680
- Annika, Göran is my best friend.
 - You said that already last week ...

82
00:09:43.840 --> 00:09:46.840
Then I lied.

83
00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:52.840
- But this time I mean it.
 -What is it?

84
00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:57.040
Ove Rainer has kissed.

85
00:10:01.960 --> 00:10:09.920
My ideas may not always work, but he can lift the whole team!

86
00:10:11.360 --> 00:10:18.800
No - not me!
 Give him the chance.
 You are a man short on Saturday.

87
00:10:18.960 --> 00:10:24.680
- Hallå ... Gustav!
 - Yes, he's there on time.
 Obvious.

88
00:10:24.840 --> 00:10:31.520
- Göran, my best friend ... - what did you want?
 I'm on the go.

89
00:10:31.680 --> 00:10:36.920
What do you think of when you see me like this?

90
00:10:37.080 --> 00:10:44.400
Yes ... what were those animals that died out before the dinosaurs came?

91
00:10:44.560 --> 00:10:51.000
Shit in it then.
 If I say this: 44 goals in one season.

92
00:10:51.160 --> 00:10:57.520
- Have you talked to Annika?
 - You have played against the brass!

93
00:10:57.680 --> 00:11:03.680
- I have left behind me.
 - Did you, yes!

94
00:11:03.840 --> 00:11:11.280
Vivalla is a man short on Saturday.
 I understand if it feels unusual.

95
00:11:11.440 --> 00:11:18.800
But if you want to get somewhere, then you have to fight!
 Look at me!

96
00:11:20.760 --> 00:11:28.200
- Yes ... how then, do you mean?
 - See the paint shop down on the corner.

97
00:11:28.360 --> 00:11:32.280
- He who shot himself?
 -Before that!

98
00:11:32.440 --> 00:11:38.880
If you have half of his will, make a success on the plane!

99
00:11:39.040 --> 00:11:46.080
First I was a promise, then I couldn't play.
 I want to forget it!

100
00:11:46.240 --> 00:11:50.880
What kind of size do you have?

101
00:11:51.040 --> 00:11:57.480
First to five.
 The goal is between the apple tree and the mailbox.

102
00:11:57.640 --> 00:12:03.520
Okay.
 Just for you to stop nagging.
 You are in goal!

103
00:12:04.280 --> 00:12:07.920
Ho - ho ... came up.

104
00:12:08.080 --> 00:12:13.800
Where are you?
 - Lina, have you seen my guinea pig?

105
00:12:13.960 --> 00:12:20.120
- Have you looked out on the grill?
 - I know where he is.

106
00:12:20.280 --> 00:12:23.840
What is he doing there?

107
00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:31.040
My God, that poor man sat alone on the couch watching TV.

108
00:12:31.200 --> 00:12:37.760
- I have given you money to a cage!
 - Animals should roam freely.

109
00:12:39.280 --> 00:12:44.320
- Yeah ... what did you buy?
 - Data game and cheese bows.

110
00:12:44.480 --> 00:12:50.760
He must have his own corner where it is warm and nice.

111
00:12:50.920 --> 00:12:58.040
- Here maybe.
 Enough 30 seconds?
 - Come, then we go and eat cheeses.

112
00:12:58.200 --> 00:13:03.440
-Why are you so mean?
 - He teases with me.

113
00:13:03.600 --> 00:13:08.080
He is jealous of everything you can do.

114
00:13:08.240 --> 00:13:14.040
-Like what?
 Wear a dress?
 - You have to decide some.

115
00:13:14.200 --> 00:13:21.440
- Yes, but to the US I must not go.
 - Do you think on that trip yet?

116
00:13:21.600 --> 00:13:28.040
One year is a long time to be away from home.
 Think of your friends.

117
00:13:28.200 --> 00:13:32.560
Both Fia and Cecilia are going there.

118
00:13:32.720 --> 00:13:40.560
- A year is fast.
 They are soon at home.
 - One day I still move away from home.

119
00:13:40.720 --> 00:13:46.320
I know.
 Just don't say it so Dad hears it.

120
00:13:46.480 --> 00:13:50.840
Lena, a miracle has occurred.

121
00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:56.640
You walked over the lawn without stumbling on the crash bows?

122
00:13:56.800 --> 00:14:03.440
- Göran will start playing football again.
 -We'll see how it goes.

123
00:14:03.600 --> 00:14:07.920
Calm down, I'm by your side!

124
00:14:08.080 --> 00:14:14.800
- Osch, you might not be.
 - They don't understand what happened.

125
00:14:14.960 --> 00:14:19.600
- You know what to expect?
 -Tough excercise.

126
00:14:19.760 --> 00:14:24.200
No, a double calzone with extra cheese.

127
00:14:27.080 --> 00:14:33.360
Last night he ran up and picked up his old trophies.

128
00:14:33.520 --> 00:14:39.400
Make sure Gustav does not see them.
 He laces them.

129
00:14:41.720 --> 00:14:48.160
I hardly recognize him.
 He took time to work out.

130
00:14:48.320 --> 00:14:52.680
Gustav lay on the sofa with a sandwich.

131
00:14:52.840 --> 00:14:59.080
There is something special about guys' relationship with football.

132
00:14:59.240 --> 00:15:05.280
It is not so remarkable.
 Well, it's like we and ...

133
00:15:05.440 --> 00:15:10.640
Well, it's like us and ... Yes, what do you do?

134
00:15:10.800 --> 00:15:16.840
I am busy.
 There are plenty I have to, like ...

135
00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:20.840
Like ... what do you do yourself?

136
00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:25.040
We're talking about something else, huh?

137
00:15:26.200 --> 00:15:29.840
-What then?
 -Yes...

138
00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:37.680
Max!
 Hello, the old man ... Hello!
 Was it fun in school?
 Have you cycled anything today?

139
00:15:37.840 --> 00:15:45.080
- Do you have nothing to talk about?
 - I just want to know how you had it.

140
00:15:45.240 --> 00:15:50.120
-How have you been?
 - We burned car tires.

141
00:15:50.280 --> 00:15:55.840
- Basted stone in Andersson's glass house.
 - thank you, max ...

142
00:15:56.000 --> 00:16:01.240
BARAram -Pam - Pam - Paaaa!
 Give room for the master!

143
00:16:01.400 --> 00:16:04.240
Thanks Dad.

144
00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:15.040
- Guess how it went!
 - Success.
 You try to take care of you.

145
00:16:15.200 --> 00:16:22.480
Exactly.
 Vivalla IF won 5-0 and Göran scored all the goals!

146
00:16:22.640 --> 00:16:30.320
- Göran, it was well worth the trouble?
 - It's been a long time since I had so much fun!

147
00:16:30.480 --> 00:16:38.320
This insignificant construction worker became a frustrating thoroughbred on the plane!

148
00:16:38.480 --> 00:16:42.720
-Congratulations!
 - How did the knee feel?

149
00:16:42.880 --> 00:16:47.560
It was just as usual.

150
00:16:47.720 --> 00:16:55.640
A small bonus was that the coach said: Gustav, you have made a big effort.

151
00:16:57.200 --> 00:17:01.560
Did you hear it through the rabbit breed?

152
00:17:01.720 --> 00:17:08.440
Forget it!
 He said, "Train with us! It would be good for the whole team."

153
00:17:08.600 --> 00:17:12.560
- Now you are lying.
 -It's done...

154
00:17:12.720 --> 00:17:19.160
- But I get to train with Vivalla IF!
 - I get to play with them.

155
00:17:19.320 --> 00:17:26.560
Don't be good!
 Without me you would still have been a building carpenter!

156
00:17:26.720 --> 00:17:33.560
- I'm still a carpenter!
 - You are what you decided on.

157
00:17:33.720 --> 00:17:39.160
- In day you were Maradona!
 - were you Martin Dahlin?

158
00:17:39.320 --> 00:17:46.560
No, I'm still Gustav Svensson, the world's best postman!

159
00:17:49.520 --> 00:17:56.960
- Here comes the mushroom.
 - It's luxurious to be invited at home.

160
00:17:57.120 --> 00:18:04.480
It's so fun to be here.
 We could spend time with you around the clock!

161
00:18:04.640 --> 00:18:09.200
Then we sound the food silent ...

162
00:18:10.160 --> 00:18:15.240
Annika, did you often travel my age?

163
00:18:15.400 --> 00:18:22.880
- Yes, where I wanted, every summer.
 -There you see!
 - Where did you go?

164
00:18:23.040 --> 00:18:28.080
Östersund - Finnish Church's summer camp.

165
00:18:28.240 --> 00:18:34.640
- I want to go to the United States for a year.
 -Lina - forget the United States!

166
00:18:34.800 --> 00:18:42.440
The legal rot has been settled up to the White House.
 It's a gunpowder!

167
00:18:42.600 --> 00:18:45.440
–Wa?
 –Wa?

168
00:18:45.600 --> 00:18:52.040
It was in the newspaper this morning.
 - Is it fun with the guinea pig?

169
00:18:52.200 --> 00:18:58.400
- No, he wants to be taken care of.
 - It's hard with animals.

170
00:18:58.560 --> 00:19:04.800
Just.
 Look at Max.
 He should have food three times then.

171
00:19:04.960 --> 00:19:11.200
Now your dad has washed the sweaters and talked to the coach.

172
00:19:11.360 --> 00:19:16.200
Tomorrow at the training I am a left back.

173
00:19:16.360 --> 00:19:19.800
Mmm, what good.

174
00:19:19.960 --> 00:19:25.600
- Then you get it tough!
 - I think that for sure.

175
00:19:25.760 --> 00:19:33.120
I want to thank you.
 Without you, I would never have experienced this.
 Thanks.

176
00:19:38.440 --> 00:19:44.480
- Silver, Junior World Cup 1978 ... - I want you to have.

177
00:19:44.640 --> 00:19:51.760
Gold from 79 Don't you want to get rid of?
 Just kidding...

178
00:19:51.920 --> 00:19:59.840
Thanks!
 This one should stand next to our wedding photo.
 Or maybe in front?

179
00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:05.640
Thanks to you, the coach finally takes me seriously.

180
00:20:05.800 --> 00:20:11.040
Now I am a football player in Division 3.

181
00:20:11.200 --> 00:20:15.640
-Four.
 - Who knows what could happen?

182
00:20:15.800 --> 00:20:22.240
- I might be successful.
 - I might spin you up a lot.

183
00:20:22.400 --> 00:20:27.840
- You don't get past.
 - Yes, Gustav.

184
00:20:28.000 --> 00:20:31.440
-No.
 -Yes.

185
00:20:31.600 --> 00:20:35.720
-Not.
 - I do.

186
00:20:35.880 --> 00:20:43.120
- To like football a lot ... - then you have to believe in yourself.

187
00:20:43.280 --> 00:20:48.520
... you have to be really stupid in your head.

188
00:20:56.120 --> 00:21:02.160
-Where is Dad?
 - At the first training with Vivalla IF!

189
00:21:04.480 --> 00:21:10.600
- Has the guinea pig received food?
 -No.
 I left him back.

190
00:21:10.760 --> 00:21:15.320
Did you do that?
 It was wise.

191
00:21:15.480 --> 00:21:20.280
Yes, small animals are hard to manage.

192
00:21:20.440 --> 00:21:23.680
Bank Bonk

193
00:21:23.840 --> 00:21:27.480
Line!
 Lina, what are you doing?

194
00:21:33.360 --> 00:21:39.800
- Gustav!
 Is the training already end?
 - They broke earlier.

195
00:21:39.960 --> 00:21:46.400
- Didn't you get along?
 -Yes!
 I played back there.

196
00:21:46.560 --> 00:21:53.840
- Yeah ... Göran dribbled away.
 - No ... actually not.

197
00:21:54.000 --> 00:21:59.080
Not?
 How did you stop him then?

198
00:21:59.240 --> 00:22:04.240
- I crushed the kneecap on him.
 -What did you say?

199
00:22:04.400 --> 00:22:09.400
The ligament went off in two places.

200
00:22:09.560 --> 00:22:15.400
- But ... where is he now somewhere?
 - In Luleå.

201
00:22:15.560 --> 00:22:21.440
- They certainly have some specialist there.
 -Oh my God...!

202
00:22:21.600 --> 00:22:28.040
It was not my fault.
 I would hug him -

203
00:22:28.200 --> 00:22:34.880
- And then I lost my balance.
 I fell, he fell ... under.

204
00:22:35.040 --> 00:22:42.760
- Have you told Annika?
 - Max can take some responsibility as well.

205
00:22:42.920 --> 00:22:46.760
Do you know what you have done?

206
00:22:46.920 --> 00:22:54.720
Yes.
 I gave the team a good player - and then I broke my legs.

207
00:22:54.880 --> 00:23:01.120
I'll buy flowers and go to Luleå ... junk!

208
00:23:01.280 --> 00:23:08.640
Did you hear that?
 - Max ... What is in our garden?

209
00:23:08.800 --> 00:23:15.840
The marshlook.
 They only took 50 bucks extra when I changed to the guinea pig.

210
00:23:16.000 --> 00:23:20.240
Now he eats up your car tires.

211
00:23:26.440 --> 00:23:29.680
Come in.

212
00:23:34.840 --> 00:23:38.600
- Hi, Göran.
 - Gustav!

213
00:23:40.680 --> 00:23:44.520
-What are you doing here?
 - Göran ...

214
00:23:44.680 --> 00:23:47.600
You are welcome.

215
00:23:47.760 --> 00:23:55.360
- Have you traveled here to meet me?
 - Göran, what should I say?
 Sorry!

216
00:23:58.480 --> 00:24:05.720
- You can break off my leg!
 -Do not be sad.
 Things like that happen.

217
00:24:05.880 --> 00:24:12.080
But not so often, huh?
 When can you start playing again?

218
00:24:12.240 --> 00:24:19.880
In six months.
 But without you I would not have ended up on a football field again.

219
00:24:20.040 --> 00:24:26.680
- I get to realize an old dream.
 - Get away from Annika?

220
00:24:26.840 --> 00:24:32.680
Bergström wondered if I wanted to help as a coach.

221
00:24:32.840 --> 00:24:37.680
-Coach?
 - set up game schedules and tactics ...

222
00:24:37.840 --> 00:24:42.800
- Should you take out the team too?
 -Obvious.

223
00:24:45.600 --> 00:24:51.240
I've been thinking about who I like most ...

224
00:24:51.400 --> 00:24:57.040
- This is not possible.
 - I put up everything!

225
00:24:57.200 --> 00:25:04.200
- It's not really that easy.
 - You must not take friends and relatives?

226
00:25:04.360 --> 00:25:12.520
No, Gustav.
 I must not take you out.
 You may not even be in the area.

227
00:25:12.680 --> 00:25:16.920
It was Bergström's only requirement.

228
00:25:20.080 --> 00:25:23.720
Yes, yes ... okay.

229
00:25:23.880 --> 00:25:28.120
Congratulations then.
 Health Bergström.

230
00:25:29.160 --> 00:25:34.600
- Claims any of you a marshlook?
 - Celebrate and own ...

231
00:25:34.760 --> 00:25:40.320
He stands and crawls on the door for surgery.

232
00:25:40.480 --> 00:25:47.920
I'm coming.
 Give him a patent and he calms down.
 I'll take one too.

233
