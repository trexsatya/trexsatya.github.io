1
00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:09.040
In tonight's section of Ifs, immigrants for Swedes:

2
00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:12.120
Sweden's most fun Chinese: Evelyn Mok.

Gothenburg's best Somalis: Assia Dahir.

00:00:22.120 --> 00:00:26.000
Iran in banana salad, salmon sungae Simon Garshasebi

7
00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:29.320
Serbian Humortorpeden Branne Pavlovic.

8
00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:34.280
The grizzly bear from Iraq or really Botkyrka: Musti Jaralla.

9
00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:38.480
Arab equivalent of Ernst: master chef Zeina Mourtada.

10
00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:41.160
Humor Grek Thanos Fatas.

11
00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:43.840
The world's Swedish Arab: Elaf Ali.

12
00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:49.400
Last but not least, our program manager Ahmed Berhan.

13
00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:58.520
Welcome to IFS, where SVT looks like Hornberg's beach in the summer.

14
00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:03.360
Hookah for the whole slant.
 My name is Ahmed Behran.

15
00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:08.720
You see quiz from not only 1, 2 or 3, but all culture in Sweden.

16
00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:12.680
/WOLF WHISTLE/

17
00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:19.240
Keep up the applause for today's competitor: Eveline, Daniel and Sigrid!

18
00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:25.480
The contestant chooses one in the panel that I ask another question.

19
00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:29.640
Then the contestant decides whether they are lying or not.

20
00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:35.760
The two with the most points move on to the final.

21
00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:43.960
Me and the competitors have been drawn up who will start.

22
00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:47.240
It is a small advantage to start.

23
00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:52.320
- The advantage went to Daniel!
 - What a pressure.

24
00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:58.080
- Who in our panel do you want to start with?
 - I want to start with Zeina.

25
00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:06.520
Swedish as a second language.
 No!

26
00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:09.760
The last decades -

27
00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:14.160
- Arabic has gone about the Finnish language.

28
00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:18.320
So Arabic is Sweden's second language.

29
00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:21.640
/Ululates/

30
00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:28.640
Daniel, what do you say?
 Is Arabic the second largest language in Sweden?

31
00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:33.960
I want to trust her, but I don't think that's right.

32
00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:38.960
- Or do you not hope?
 - Grave.
 I do not think.

33
00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:41.280
You don't think.

34
00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:46.560
You chose not to believe in Zeina and you did it completely wrong.

35
00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:54.360
Arabic has passed Finnish as the second largest language.

36
00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:58.480
Researchers estimate that over 200,000 speak.

37
00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:03.200
But don't worry, that's only 2 percent.

38
00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:08.200
Better luck next time.
 To the next competitor: Sigrid!

39
00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:17.360
Sigrid, which of these ten do you feel you can trust?

40
00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:21.720
Everyone looks credible, but I believe in Simon.

41
00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:27.280
- I drive at Simon.
 - Blonde girls like Simon.

42
00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:31.760
Simon was happy like she chose him on a date.

43
00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:36.640
- She just should ask one question, brother.
 - Error program, Simon.

44
00:03:42.320 --> 00:03:47.400
They launched a garment for children with the Wild West/Sheriff theme.

45
00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:52.200
The problem was that the garment was similar to the catch suits in Auschwitz.

46
00:03:54.960 --> 00:03:57.880
- Sigrid?
 - I believe in him.

47
00:03:58.040 --> 00:04:03.280
- Simon already has citizenship.
 -Damn it!

48
00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:13.440
You chose to believe in Simon and you were completely wrong.

49
00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:16.240
- But, Simon!
 - It was false.

50
00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:20.560
What he described has happened, but it was Zara.

51
00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:27.240
H & amp; m had a dark child with the t-shirt "Coolest Monkey in the Jungle".

52
00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:34.040
And that child was Ahmed.

53
00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:42.160
Sorry, sorry!
 Don't challenge me to an afrospus.

54
00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:47.000
Sigrid, better happiness next time.

55
00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:53.320
Two have driven, no one has any points.
 - Eveline, time for you to shine.

56
00:04:53.480 --> 00:05:00.120
I am automatically drawn to the girl up there to the left.

57
00:05:00.280 --> 00:05:04.240
I feel we have color coordinated tonight as well.

58
00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:10.560
You are the Swedish version of me: narrower, sweeter and whiter.

59
00:05:10.720 --> 00:05:13.480
My Parents would be so proud.

60
00:05:13.640 --> 00:05:19.520
Evenlyn will send you on its job interviews in the future.

61
00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:24.240
If you are invited to a Chinese New Year celebration, you might get a Hongbao.

62
00:05:24.400 --> 00:05:26.360
What is it?

63
00:05:26.520 --> 00:05:32.080
Type a dumpling that has dough as content.
 It's dough on dough.

64
00:05:32.240 --> 00:05:38.560
It is a steamed bread that you eat on New Year that "saturates" for the rest of the year.

65
00:05:38.720 --> 00:05:42.080
As you can see, I have eaten a lot.

66
00:05:42.240 --> 00:05:46.320
It sounds too logical to be a lie.

67
00:05:46.480 --> 00:05:52.040
I hope that Evelyn does not betray me now and that we get the first point.

68
00:05:52.200 --> 00:05:56.880
You believed in Evelyn and you were completely wrong.

69
00:05:58.160 --> 00:06:01.480
So, my heart is crushed!

70
00:06:01.640 --> 00:06:07.880
Hongbao is small, red envelopes with money that you give each other on New Year.

71
00:06:08.040 --> 00:06:13.720
For Chinese, it is Hongbao, but for Syrians Tax Situation.

72
00:06:20.400 --> 00:06:25.240
- Daniel, time to collect points.
 -Thanos.

73
00:06:25.400 --> 00:06:27.600
Thanos!

74
00:06:29.920 --> 00:06:34.920
- I just become more convinced.
 -Thanos?

75
00:06:39.520 --> 00:06:43.440
Which blatte would pay for the food.

76
00:06:43.600 --> 00:06:46.400
The kebab riot was in Örebro.

77
00:06:46.560 --> 00:06:50.680
One person hit another with a kebab roll in the head.

78
00:06:50.840 --> 00:06:54.040
Then it completely degenerated.

79
00:06:57.040 --> 00:07:02.840
One hit another with a kebab roll in the head and then it completely degenerated?

80
00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:06.320
- I think he is lying.
 -Why?

81
00:07:06.480 --> 00:07:12.520
It feels too small.
 For such a brawl you must have more than one roll.

82
00:07:14.040 --> 00:07:19.840
You didn't believe in Thanos.
 You did absolutely right.
 Tonight's first point!

83
00:07:25.040 --> 00:07:30.040
The kebab bracket revolved around an exclusive restaurant on Hornsberg's beach.

84
00:07:30.200 --> 00:07:34.480
Accommodation tried to evict the restaurant because they were disturbed.

85
00:07:34.640 --> 00:07:38.760
Congratulations to the first point.
 Welcome into the match.

86
00:07:42.960 --> 00:07:46.880
Sigrid, your lamb Simon betrayed you last.

87
00:07:47.040 --> 00:07:52.200
I continue in the middle to the beautiful woman there.
 Elaf.

88
00:07:55.440 --> 00:08:01.000
Iraq's national law, mine and mustis, is called bache.

89
00:08:01.160 --> 00:08:07.320
It is that you eat the whole sheep.
 The face with eyes, ie the head.

90
00:08:07.480 --> 00:08:12.480
All organs and intestines.
 Then you fill the intestines with different things.

91
00:08:12.640 --> 00:08:15.480
- Jarre as well.
 - Everything on.

92
00:08:15.640 --> 00:08:21.560
After all, we jaw crayfish and suck, so I believe in that.

93
00:08:21.720 --> 00:08:27.640
That we eat intestines, brains and eyes.
 You think Iraqis do?

94
00:08:27.800 --> 00:08:30.920
Why not?

95
00:08:31.080 --> 00:08:34.800
Consider when taking off the crayfish ...

96
00:08:34.960 --> 00:08:39.240
I compared with crayfish.
 I still say yes.

97
00:08:39.400 --> 00:08:44.520
Heavy are you standing on you.
 You've received your first point.

98
00:08:49.480 --> 00:08:55.560
Neither Elaf nor Musti lied to you.
 It is sheep with Balls and Everything.

99
00:08:55.720 --> 00:09:00.400
- Eveline, ready to go into the match?
 - Day for revenge.

100
00:09:00.560 --> 00:09:05.600
- Who do you choose to trust?
 -That's the question.
 - Filip, we drive on.

101
00:09:06.800 --> 00:09:11.640
- You are already shaking his head.
 - What the hell are you laughing at?

102
00:09:11.800 --> 00:09:15.920
I love this program.
 No one else can have such a question.

103
00:09:16.080 --> 00:09:18.240
Bastard...

104
00:09:21.560 --> 00:09:24.840
--... is an insult.
 - What do you call horny?

105
00:09:25.800 --> 00:09:29.880
This is how the kebab brawl began.

106
00:09:36.880 --> 00:09:40.760
It is used in the typography when writing -

107
00:09:40.920 --> 00:09:46.600
- And the last word ends up on the next page or alone in the next paragraph.

108
00:09:46.760 --> 00:09:51.400
Then it is called a horn.
 It's not hose.

109
00:09:51.560 --> 00:09:55.000
"Check out that horid! Fucking Horunge, you stand out."

110
00:09:55.160 --> 00:10:01.640
It is a trade term, not fuck term, but a professional term.
 YES!

111
00:10:09.680 --> 00:10:14.040
-Yes!
 We drive on it.
 - Sista The Word is called "Horunge"?

112
00:10:14.200 --> 00:10:20.080
It makes sense.
 Type anyway.
 You want to get rid of it, if it is in the way.

113
00:10:26.960 --> 00:10:32.560
Eveline, do you know what?
 Congratulations!
 You got your first point.

114
00:10:36.760 --> 00:10:39.680
-Cruelly.
 Welcome into the match.
 -Finally.

115
00:10:39.840 --> 00:10:44.440
- Daniel, who do you choose in the panel?
 --Assia.

116
00:10:47.480 --> 00:10:52.000
It's Somali for "Eat Your Dad".

117
00:10:56.560 --> 00:11:02.520
- Why do you laugh at my language?
 - We just need a context.

118
00:11:02.680 --> 00:11:08.400
- See your dad.
 --Assia, can you say that?

119
00:11:08.560 --> 00:11:14.080
That means that.
 It's too stupid.
 It must be "eat your dad".

120
00:11:14.240 --> 00:11:17.760
You can be a stupid.

121
00:11:17.920 --> 00:11:21.520
I dug this grave myself.

122
00:11:21.680 --> 00:11:26.240
You did absolutely right, Daniel.
 You got one more point.

123
00:11:29.480 --> 00:11:35.720
It make sense.
 Syrians marry cousins and Somalis are hungry.

124
00:11:35.880 --> 00:11:42.280
- When do you have to eat your father?
 - When your mom is cross -on on you.

125
00:11:42.440 --> 00:11:47.920
Many swearing has to do with mothers, but in Somalia we are feminists.

126
00:11:48.080 --> 00:11:51.760
We insult dads instead.

127
00:11:51.920 --> 00:11:55.800
You have done something that I get shit for.
 "Eat your dad!"

128
00:11:55.960 --> 00:12:00.760
- We have something similar in Arabic.
 - Extreme, you see.

129
00:12:06.080 --> 00:12:10.600
- Sigrid?
 - I think Anitha glitters up there.

130
00:12:10.760 --> 00:12:13.200
I have to take her.

131
00:12:19.600 --> 00:12:21.600
The Brazil fever was ...

132
00:12:21.760 --> 00:12:24.520
A horoung.

133
00:12:27.160 --> 00:12:31.360
It was an astronomical chlamydia outbreak.

134
00:12:31.520 --> 00:12:37.520
An aggressive form of chlamydia who came with the sailors from Brazil.

135
00:12:37.680 --> 00:12:41.840
The destruction of many people's sex life in Sundsvall.

136
00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:46.000
- I was close.
 - It sounded awful.

137
00:12:46.160 --> 00:12:51.480
Lucky you were not in Sundsvall.
 But I don't believe it.

138
00:12:51.640 --> 00:12:57.400
- Why don't you believe in Anitha?
 - So much chlamydia in Sundsvall?

139
00:12:57.560 --> 00:13:02.320
I'm almost the only Swede.
 You have to believe me.

140
00:13:02.480 --> 00:13:09.120
I'm sorry, but no.
 I'm from Skåne.
 It's not possible.
 No no.

141
00:13:09.280 --> 00:13:14.200
You did absolutely right, because you got one more point.

142
00:13:18.160 --> 00:13:22.080
Brazil fever was the newspapers called the 19th century trend-

143
00:13:22.240 --> 00:13:26.960
- Emigrate from Sundsvall to Brazil.

144
00:13:27.120 --> 00:13:33.000
Eveline, your turn again.
 Who in the panel would you like to talk to?

145
00:13:33.160 --> 00:13:36.760
- I think I take Musti.
 - Yeah.

146
00:13:41.880 --> 00:13:44.440
Dirty money.

147
00:13:45.160 --> 00:13:50.680
Nämen ... I see many Arabs here and you will confirm what I say.

148
00:13:50.840 --> 00:13:57.200
It is the high -rise cake with floors depending on status and wealth.

149
00:13:57.360 --> 00:14:02.000
It can be so high that you have to cut the cake with a sword.

150
00:14:02.160 --> 00:14:04.920
So it's Dabke.

151
00:14:05.080 --> 00:14:09.360
- Wear at a Middle East wedding?
 -Unfortunately not.

152
00:14:09.520 --> 00:14:12.680
But it's never too late.

153
00:14:12.840 --> 00:14:15.360
/Cheer/

154
00:14:19.080 --> 00:14:23.880
- It was not a passport.
 - The lady can stand with the sniper somewhere.

155
00:14:25.680 --> 00:14:32.360
It sounds so random, but also too random to make it ...

156
00:14:32.520 --> 00:14:37.640
It's so random, so it's probably true.
 It's a little reverse psychology.

157
00:14:37.800 --> 00:14:41.040
I believe in him.

158
00:14:41.200 --> 00:14:46.280
- You were completely wrong.
 Unfortunately.
 - No wedding for you.

159
00:14:46.440 --> 00:14:50.400
It is Arab folk dance that is usually danced to drums.

160
00:14:50.560 --> 00:14:52.960
Filip, show!

161
00:14:53.120 --> 00:15:00.280
Eveline, when you did not score points, it is run for you to go to the final.

162
00:15:00.440 --> 00:15:05.640
But Daniel, you can take the lead as it says 2-2 between you and Sigrid.

163
00:15:05.800 --> 00:15:10.000
If you take the next question, start the final round.

164
00:15:10.160 --> 00:15:13.920
- What do you put your card on?
 - Branne.

165
00:15:24.600 --> 00:15:28.080
-My childhood.
 - All recognizes.

166
00:15:28.240 --> 00:15:32.000
I'm about to be shot.

167
00:15:33.040 --> 00:15:36.600
No, it's very simple.

168
00:15:36.760 --> 00:15:41.760
Foreign homes have spicy food, you want to protect the sofa ...

169
00:15:41.920 --> 00:15:46.480
- You buy a sofa and have it ... - in 40 years.

170
00:15:46.640 --> 00:15:49.880
...the rest of life.
 An investment.

171
00:15:51.880 --> 00:15:54.120
What does Daniel say?

172
00:15:54.280 --> 00:15:58.440
If you protect the furniture from spicy food, I do not know.

173
00:15:58.600 --> 00:16:03.480
- But you are afraid of the stuff you have.
 -Okay, autist.

174
00:16:03.640 --> 00:16:07.480
I believe in him.
 I buy the car.

175
00:16:07.640 --> 00:16:12.600
Not every day a Serb hears it, but you did absolutely right.
 Congratulations!

176
00:16:15.680 --> 00:16:18.440
It is a way to protect stuff.

177
00:16:18.600 --> 00:16:24.400
You wrap the sofa, the TV control, the child you like ...

178
00:16:24.560 --> 00:16:28.720
My dad did not remove the plastic from the TV.

179
00:16:28.880 --> 00:16:31.840
He had the advertising from ...

180
00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:35.640
Dad didn't remove it from his iPhone.

181
00:16:35.800 --> 00:16:40.840
He advertised it and said the sound was not working.

182
00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:46.480
We had a fantastic living room.
 We only had to go in when guests arrived.

183
00:16:46.640 --> 00:16:50.040
An entire room that could never be used.

184
00:16:52.120 --> 00:16:58.880
Keep up the applause.
 We thank Eveline for competing.

185
00:17:00.240 --> 00:17:03.080
Unfortunately, you will not move on.

186
00:17:03.240 --> 00:17:08.600
A huge applause to Daniel and Sigrid who run the final round!

187
00:17:20.120 --> 00:17:24.240
You did a good job of taking you through the first round.

188
00:17:24.400 --> 00:17:29.000
In others you will collect five points.
 First to five.

189
00:17:29.160 --> 00:17:31.600
But there is a small twist.

190
00:17:31.760 --> 00:17:36.640
If you answer wrong, the opponent will receive your score.
 - Daniel?

191
00:17:36.800 --> 00:17:41.600
Yes.
 I try new faces.
 I start with Filip.

192
00:17:41.760 --> 00:17:45.440
- Hello, sir!
 - Filip ...

193
00:17:53.200 --> 00:18:01.240
It is an excellent expression of scornful distaste.

194
00:18:02.320 --> 00:18:05.360
Do you understand what I mean?

195
00:18:05.520 --> 00:18:13.680
Imagine that a short, weak man at a club challenges you in fights.

196
00:18:13.840 --> 00:18:18.560
You don't want to beat him.
 After all, he is short and weak.

197
00:18:18.720 --> 00:18:22.680
You point him in the face and say, "What a hood!"

198
00:18:22.840 --> 00:18:27.520
Or if a guy goes up to a girl gang and should impress.

199
00:18:27.680 --> 00:18:31.280
He flashes money and invites them.

200
00:18:31.440 --> 00:18:37.240
Instead of being upset, they can laugh and say, "What a hood!"

201
00:18:37.400 --> 00:18:42.240
- you?!
 - A scornful expression of distaste.

202
00:18:42.400 --> 00:18:47.280
One hundred percent lie.
 It is too long and for elaborate.

203
00:18:47.440 --> 00:18:53.280
- Of course it's lying.
 - Filip, what a hood!

204
00:18:53.440 --> 00:18:58.440
- I maintain that it is lying.
 -A tip?
 There are variations.

205
00:18:58.600 --> 00:19:04.240
- Sicked face!
 What a pan!
 - Forely lying.

206
00:19:04.400 --> 00:19:08.720
- If you answer wrong, Sigrid gets points.
 -I know.

207
00:19:08.880 --> 00:19:11.600
I'm getting cocky.

208
00:19:11.760 --> 00:19:15.800
Self -confidence on top, but points to Sigrid.

209
00:19:18.880 --> 00:19:22.280
What a hood!

210
00:19:22.440 --> 00:19:28.440
You got a free score.
 We see if the train continues to tough for you.

211
00:19:28.600 --> 00:19:33.040
We'll see.
 I think I choose ... Simon.

212
00:19:38.680 --> 00:19:41.520
Simon, please.
 Invite her, brother.

213
00:19:41.680 --> 00:19:46.320
Behind this table He's Hard Like A Rock.

214
00:19:46.480 --> 00:19:51.040
Every time she says Simon you see his nameplate "Du-Dum".

215
00:19:52.120 --> 00:19:57.600
- I have a girl.
 I'm sorry.
 - Why didn't you say that before?

216
00:19:59.280 --> 00:20:04.520
If you move around Persian cuisine you can be offered Tahdiq.

217
00:20:06.760 --> 00:20:10.600
You are offered a plate.
 No, then ...

218
00:20:10.760 --> 00:20:15.960
It is when you leave the saucepan for a little too long.

219
00:20:16.120 --> 00:20:19.280
If you cook rice, let it be burned -

220
00:20:19.440 --> 00:20:25.400
- So they become like a crust that you eat for the rice.
 It's delicious.

221
00:20:25.560 --> 00:20:30.080
- The Irranes' response to crispbread.
 -Okay!

222
00:20:30.240 --> 00:20:36.400
No ... - sorry, Simon.
 You've Already Broke My Heart.

223
00:20:39.080 --> 00:20:44.600
So you say no?
 You choose not to believe in Simon.

224
00:20:44.760 --> 00:20:49.960
Well, you did away with it.
 Daniel did this.
 He got a point.

225
00:20:53.600 --> 00:21:00.240
So slippery is Iranians.
 They burn your food, turn it and serve it.

226
00:21:00.400 --> 00:21:04.040
Daniel, you got a point.
 Congratulations.

227
00:21:04.200 --> 00:21:07.640
- Who do you choose to talk to?
 –Alaf.

228
00:21:10.880 --> 00:21:12.960
I thought they were younger.

229
00:21:13.120 --> 00:21:18.480
They debut when they are around 17, the second year of high school.
 Ish.

230
00:21:18.640 --> 00:21:24.480
How old is that statistics?
 Now they debut when they are seven.

231
00:21:24.640 --> 00:21:27.640
-Difficult!
 - When you debuted?

232
00:21:27.800 --> 00:21:33.840
I was 17, so it could be true.
 I say it's true.

233
00:21:34.000 --> 00:21:38.880
I think many people pull down the age, but many people pull it up.

234
00:21:39.040 --> 00:21:42.960
- So 17 may be true.
 - All Muslims pull up age.

235
00:21:43.120 --> 00:21:47.600
What are you talking about?
 We get married when we are 13.

236
00:21:47.760 --> 00:21:50.040
Daniel, you did absolutely right.

237
00:21:50.200 --> 00:21:53.240
Elaf doesn't lie to you.
 16.9.

238
00:21:56.320 --> 00:22:00.240
Sigrid!
 Who do you want to talk to?

239
00:22:00.400 --> 00:22:03.680
- Simony.
 - He is driven.

240
00:22:03.840 --> 00:22:08.280
The master villain Thanos.

241
00:22:08.440 --> 00:22:14.640
Isn't that in Marvel?
 I think so.

242
00:22:14.800 --> 00:22:16.600
Thanos ...

243
00:22:21.960 --> 00:22:25.400
Nose Job.
 I know.

244
00:22:30.240 --> 00:22:33.080
Nämen, joking aside.

245
00:22:37.200 --> 00:22:42.400
It is a Persian expression of when a person looks at you obliquely.

246
00:22:42.560 --> 00:22:45.720
So for example ...

247
00:22:47.760 --> 00:22:50.040
Chap chap at Elaf right now.

248
00:22:50.200 --> 00:22:54.280
I'm doing chap chap all the time, then?

249
00:22:57.840 --> 00:23:00.880
/Howks and applause/

250
00:23:01.920 --> 00:23:05.880
Evelyn, you don't look obliquely.
 You pee straight.

251
00:23:09.640 --> 00:23:12.440
Started badly and got worse.

252
00:23:12.600 --> 00:23:17.800
There will be no season 2 of this program.

253
00:23:18.640 --> 00:23:24.080
The name, so ... I think Chap Chap is something else.

254
00:23:24.240 --> 00:23:29.280
-What would that be?
 - Isn't they cutting them?

255
00:23:33.360 --> 00:23:37.880
Sigrid, what did you say?
 That they cut up?

256
00:23:38.040 --> 00:23:43.600
- No, circumcision.
 -She means chop-chop.

257
00:23:48.960 --> 00:23:52.200
-Why?
 - It's good to think outside the box.

258
00:23:52.360 --> 00:23:56.840
But this time you chop-chopped yourself.

259
00:23:57.000 --> 00:24:01.960
You are wrong.
 Thanos did not lie.
 Chap chap means to check obliquely.

260
00:24:02.120 --> 00:24:06.120
So Daniel, you got one more point.

261
00:24:07.080 --> 00:24:09.840
It's called Chap Chap Negah Mikone.

262
00:24:10.000 --> 00:24:13.600
Which one does when someone has burned even fakking rice.

263
00:24:15.240 --> 00:24:17.320
That's how it is.

264
00:24:17.480 --> 00:24:19.360
Musti.

265
00:24:25.160 --> 00:24:30.480
Two cig and an adidas suit.
 - Or am I wrong?

266
00:24:32.160 --> 00:24:36.880
It's Rakija.
 Haram.
 I haven't been drinking.

267
00:24:37.040 --> 00:24:40.600
There are spirits on plums that are used for everything.

268
00:24:40.760 --> 00:24:45.720
From cold to ordinary wounds on the arm.
 Everything.

269
00:24:47.680 --> 00:24:50.760
Raki is located in Greece too.

270
00:24:50.920 --> 00:24:55.000
There can be something down the Balkans and that peninsula.

271
00:24:55.160 --> 00:24:59.160
I think he speaks the truth.
 It is the house cure.

272
00:24:59.320 --> 00:25:05.000
You believe in Musti?
 Congratulations, Daniel, you got one more point.

273
00:25:09.320 --> 00:25:14.160
Sigrid, before we continue.
 If you are in control of the scoreboard ...

274
00:25:14.320 --> 00:25:17.080
... so it looks dark to me.

275
00:25:17.240 --> 00:25:21.960
What happens is that if you guess wrong, Daniel gets your score -

276
00:25:22.120 --> 00:25:25.480
- And he has won the entire competition.

277
00:25:25.640 --> 00:25:31.000
- Attempt not to do away with you.
 - In will try.
 - Zeina.

278
00:25:36.000 --> 00:25:42.480
Oh!
 Thus, it is one of the world's oldest flags.

279
00:25:42.640 --> 00:25:49.720
The first copies were found sometime around 150 years after Christ.

280
00:25:49.880 --> 00:25:54.000
Many people think it's an eagle on the flag -

281
00:25:54.160 --> 00:25:59.360
- But it is a grilled lamb that you have fan out.

282
00:25:59.520 --> 00:26:05.680
This is because the lamb is the National Animals of the Syrians.

283
00:26:05.840 --> 00:26:08.880
One of the oldest flags available.

284
00:26:09.040 --> 00:26:13.880
- I don't think that's true.
 -Not?
 Why?

285
00:26:14.040 --> 00:26:17.800
Just a feeling.
 This time it is.

286
00:26:17.960 --> 00:26:22.960
That is absolutely right.
 You've received a point.

287
00:26:26.800 --> 00:26:29.880
Zeina drew a little white lie.

288
00:26:30.040 --> 00:26:35.080
The Syrian flag was created in the 1980s in Sweden.

289
00:26:36.200 --> 00:26:37.800
Huh?

290
00:26:37.960 --> 00:26:42.960
The first was created by the Syrian National Association in Stockholm in 1980.

291
00:26:43.120 --> 00:26:49.760
The design was nailed in 1982 and the flag was adopted internationally in 1983.

292
00:26:53.280 --> 00:26:57.120
-What did you have before the 80s?
 - We had no country.

293
00:26:57.280 --> 00:27:03.040
- We ran for freedom and justice.
 - Syrians, did you come from nowhere?

294
00:27:03.200 --> 00:27:07.800
We are actually the indigenous population in first civilization Mesopotamia.

295
00:27:07.960 --> 00:27:12.360
- talk to me nice.
 - You weren't!

296
00:27:12.520 --> 00:27:18.400
- Check what you started.
 Take it easy!
 - It can be war.
 Stop it quickly.

297
00:27:18.560 --> 00:27:21.560
You have the chance to lock the game now.

298
00:27:21.720 --> 00:27:26.640
I will take someone I have not taken, Evelyn or Anitha.

299
00:27:26.800 --> 00:27:31.720
Anitha looks too tricky with her eyebrows, so it will be Evelyn.

300
00:27:31.880 --> 00:27:34.080
Evelyn?

301
00:27:36.880 --> 00:27:40.640
Many.
 And everyone is Iranians.

302
00:27:42.400 --> 00:27:49.800
No, but there are actually exactly 1,051 people.

303
00:27:49.960 --> 00:27:56.280
There are all old soldier names like post, proud and spear ...

304
00:27:56.440 --> 00:28:02.360
Clearly you can be called Swedish by surname.
 1051, yes.
 I believe in you.

305
00:28:02.520 --> 00:28:07.240
You believe in Evelyn.
 You said it's an old soldier name?

306
00:28:07.400 --> 00:28:11.800
You are so fakking right.
 Congratulations, Daniel!

307
00:28:13.240 --> 00:28:18.520
That's right.
 It is an old soldier tradition.

308
00:28:18.680 --> 00:28:24.160
An extra name the military gave the congregation so not everyone was called Olof and Johan.

309
00:28:24.320 --> 00:28:30.280
It became difficult to give orders then.
 A big applause for tonight's winner!

310
00:28:34.200 --> 00:28:38.360
Sigrid, great work.
 - Daniel, came here.

311
00:28:39.680 --> 00:28:45.560
You should get your IFS diploma.
 You get flowers ...

312
00:28:45.720 --> 00:28:52.040
A huge applause.
 Thanks to the contestants, the audience, you at home -

313
00:28:52.200 --> 00:28:56.120
- And not least our fantastic panel.

314
00:28:58.600 --> 00:29:02.720
Don't forget to look at us next week again.

315
00:29:02.880 --> 00:29:05.840
