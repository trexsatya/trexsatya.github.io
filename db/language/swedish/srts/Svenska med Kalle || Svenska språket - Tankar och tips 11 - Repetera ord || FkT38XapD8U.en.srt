00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,860
Hello

2
00:00:01,340 --> 00:00:04,140
In this movie I will try to give some tips

3
00:00:04,240 --> 00:00:06,240
on how you can work out

4
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:07,760
And repeat

5
00:00:08,200 --> 00:00:11,100
Words, new words, that you have learned.

6
00:00:11,100 --> 00:00:13,060
And the first

7
00:00:13,540 --> 00:00:15,540
And the easiest way is of course to

8
00:00:15,540 --> 00:00:17,400
record the words

9
00:00:17,940 --> 00:00:19,940
And then read them again.

10
00:00:19,940 --> 00:00:21,440
at a later moment

11
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:25,440
For example, that you record words in school, on the lesson

12
00:00:25,440 --> 00:00:27,240
and then when you get home

13
00:00:27,860 --> 00:00:29,860
so do you read through the words one more time

14
00:00:31,420 --> 00:00:33,420
But there are many other ways to train

15
00:00:33,420 --> 00:00:35,340
For example, so

16
00:00:35,620 --> 00:00:37,620
can you write the words many times

17
00:00:38,660 --> 00:00:40,660
and you can do that in slightly different ways

18
00:00:41,020 --> 00:00:43,500
This is how I have an example.
 I'll try to show.

19
00:00:44,300 --> 00:00:46,300
Should we see if it is visible here.

20
00:00:46,620 --> 00:00:48,620
This is how I have a list of words.

21
00:00:53,500 --> 00:00:55,500
And then I have made columns here

22
00:00:55,500 --> 00:00:57,280
I write all the words once

23
00:00:58,200 --> 00:01:00,760
And then I start over from the beginning

24
00:01:00,760 --> 00:01:02,600
And then I write all the words again.

25
00:01:03,800 --> 00:01:06,280
Then I write all the words one more time

26
00:01:06,280 --> 00:01:07,920
so that you change words

27
00:01:07,960 --> 00:01:09,960
And at the same time writes

28
00:01:10,820 --> 00:01:13,060
all the words several times

29
00:01:14,340 --> 00:01:17,200
I think it's a little better to

30
00:01:18,340 --> 00:01:21,240
for memory, you have to try to remember the words

31
00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:23,060
just not repeat them many times

32
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:27,420
Or you just write a list.
 You write each word five times.
 It also works.

33
00:01:29,720 --> 00:01:31,720
Then of course it is important to use the words

34
00:01:32,680 --> 00:01:35,000
So if you have any words you really want to learn.

35
00:01:35,860 --> 00:01:38,500
So try to use those words when talking

36
00:01:39,300 --> 00:01:41,400
Preferably several times during one day.

37
00:01:41,620 --> 00:01:43,620
Or several times for a week.

38
00:01:44,620 --> 00:01:46,920
And feel free to use the words when you chat too

39
00:01:47,140 --> 00:01:49,760
or when writing on facebook or something

40
00:01:49,980 --> 00:01:51,980
Maybe when you write a text in school.

41
00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:54,600
For when using the words

42
00:01:55,060 --> 00:01:57,900
Then they will get better in memory.

43
00:01:59,620 --> 00:02:01,620
Then you should not forget

44
00:02:01,660 --> 00:02:03,660
To read texts

45
00:02:03,660 --> 00:02:05,660
And listen to

46
00:02:06,060 --> 00:02:08,520
radio or watching TV

47
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:10,420
It is also to repeat words.

48
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:13,200
For every time you hear the word

49
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:14,460
Or sees the word

50
00:02:14,940 --> 00:02:17,240
So it will get a little better in memory.

51
00:02:18,340 --> 00:02:21,000
So, for example, if you read an easy -to -read book.

52
00:02:22,060 --> 00:02:24,440
So every time you recognize a word.

53
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:27,120
And common words come many times.

54
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:29,840
Each time you recognize a word.

55
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:32,280
So you will remember it a little better.

56
00:02:33,380 --> 00:02:35,880
So that's why it is very good to both read

57
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:38,240
And listen a little every day.

58
00:02:39,080 --> 00:02:42,400
Because then the most important and most common words come in Swedish

59
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:45,580
you will repeat them automatically

60
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:50,680
Then you can also do these Flashcards

61
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:54,860
Flashcard, it's short, we usually say that in English

62
00:02:55,480 --> 00:02:59,260
It is, for example, if I have, here is "Chair" in English

63
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:01,840
and on the other side stands “a chair”

64
00:03:02,500 --> 00:03:04,500
So you write on your mother tongue

65
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:07,760
And on the other side you write the Swedish word

66
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:10,280
Then you have many such patches

67
00:03:11,220 --> 00:03:13,660
and then you just sit and read on your mother tongue

68
00:03:14,220 --> 00:03:16,440
and trying to remember words in Swedish

69
00:03:17,700 --> 00:03:19,700
and the last thing you can do

70
00:03:20,980 --> 00:03:25,200
It is that you, the same thing as, with such cards

71
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:27,100
but that you find an app

72
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:29,240
For example, memrise

73
00:03:31,060 --> 00:03:33,500
or you can also use

74
00:03:36,220 --> 00:03:38,500
This program Quizlet

75
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:44,640
Both programs are also available for your computer if you want.

76
00:03:46,460 --> 00:03:52,400
It is also a great way to train words, for example if you are not at home and do not have your notes

77
00:03:54,060 --> 00:03:57,080
So we had read the words, write the words

78
00:03:58,300 --> 00:04:00,880
Using the words when talking and writing

79
00:04:01,880 --> 00:04:04,660
read texts so you see the words many times

80
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:06,800
Listen to texts

81
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:08,360
Radio and TV

82
00:04:09,060 --> 00:04:11,060
so that you hear the words many times

83
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:14,200
And then we had such flashcards

84
00:04:15,340 --> 00:04:17,600
or that you are training on your mobile

85
00:04:17,700 --> 00:04:19,700
There were my tips today

86
00:04:19,700 --> 00:04:21,280
Please leave a comment

87
00:04:21,820 --> 00:04:26,040
and if you have any questions or if you have your own tips

88
00:04:26,300 --> 00:04:28,300
on how to learn the words.

89
00:04:28,620 --> 00:04:30,620
Hello and see you again soon.
