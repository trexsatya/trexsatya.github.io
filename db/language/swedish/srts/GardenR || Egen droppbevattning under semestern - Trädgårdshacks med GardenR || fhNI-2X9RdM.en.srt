Hello, today a notch regarding keeping moisture during the holidays

2
00:00:09.160 --> 00:00:11.000
Welcome to Trädgårdshacks with Gardenr

3
00:00:11.264 --> 00:00:12.800
Now it's summer, holiday

4
00:00:13.056 --> 00:00:14.592
Then you leave home

5
00:00:14.848 --> 00:00:15.872
But what happens, with the plants then

6
00:00:16.384 --> 00:00:17.664
They must be watered

7
00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:23.260
There is a way to let them maintain moisture a little longer and it is with drip irrigation and the like

8
00:00:23.620 --> 00:00:26.620
And you can buy that, quite expensive, or you can of course do it yourself

9
00:00:27.392 --> 00:00:28.672
Here a little classic

10
00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:32.480
one places a jar or glass of water in the pot

11
00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:37.640
and then you can use any kind of thread or string that sucks up water well

12
00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:41.984
But my favorite is really a piece of an old mop

13
00:00:42.496 --> 00:00:43.520
When they are over

14
00:00:43.776 --> 00:00:46.336
Can you remove one of the pieces from the mop

15
00:00:46.848 --> 00:00:47.616
such a nice thing

16
00:00:47.872 --> 00:00:49.152
sucks water really well

17
00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:53.380
and then push it into the soil and properly, one end

18
00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:56.840
And the other end lets you dip into this water glass

19
00:00:57.344 --> 00:00:59.904
so it sucks water down into the pot and retains moisture

20
00:01:00.928 --> 00:01:03.488
It lasts for a while, you can't go on any longer trip

21
00:01:03.744 --> 00:01:05.024
Should one be a little further away

22
00:01:05.536 --> 00:01:07.840
Then you have to make a drip irrigation bottle

23
00:01:08.352 --> 00:01:09.120
Now I will show how to do

24
00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:12.240
one takes two flower sticks

25
00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:14.240
And so little silver tape

26
00:01:14.752 --> 00:01:17.056
I will save you that I cuddle with it

27
00:01:17.824 --> 00:01:19.616
so i have prepared tape pieces

28
00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:21.664
Attach them

29
00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:23.712
is happy to use two pieces

30
00:01:24.992 --> 00:01:26.016
stuck with it too

31
00:01:26.272 --> 00:01:29.344
Silver tape heavenly good, you can use for the most

32
00:01:29.856 --> 00:01:33.440
Now we have created a small position here for our drip irrigation

33
00:01:34.464 --> 00:01:36.256
Then it's time to get a little

34
00:01:36.768 --> 00:01:38.816
hole, a lid where we can

35
00:01:39.072 --> 00:01:40.864
pour down water and water

36
00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:47.060
so what we want is that we get a lid here that we can open when we are going to fill it with water

37
00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:52.380
But it may be closed, so it doesn't fall down stuff in our fine drip irrigation

38
00:01:53.664 --> 00:01:55.456
we have it down into the pot

39
00:01:55.968 --> 00:01:57.504
and then we take a water can

40
00:01:58.272 --> 00:02:00.320
replenishes up here with water

41
00:02:01.856 --> 00:02:04.416
And then you open the cork here

42
00:02:04.672 --> 00:02:05.952
Pretty gently

43
00:02:06.464 --> 00:02:08.768
so that just just

44
00:02:09.024 --> 00:02:11.328
runs out a little bit a little bit

45
00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:12.864
drip, drip, drip

46
00:02:13.376 --> 00:02:14.144
Down in the pot

47
00:02:14.656 --> 00:02:15.936
And then you can go on vacation

48
00:02:16.192 --> 00:02:16.704
Have a great time

49
00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:17.728
Good luck
