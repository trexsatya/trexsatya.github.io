1
00:00:11,511 --> 00:00:14,413
Welcome aboard a dietal class mining vessel.

2
00:00:14,413 --> 00:00:16,634
Up here from the bridge, the ship is driven.

3
00:00:17,317 --> 00:00:22,789
An officer navigates the ship and gives orders to a seaman about what course the vessel should hold.

4
00:00:23,325 --> 00:00:27,897
In addition, there are lookouts that with binoculars look for things around the ship

5
00:00:28,795 --> 00:00:30,797
The ship's manager is also often found here.

6
00:00:31,364 --> 00:00:35,090
All of these work as a team and help to perform the ship for sure

7
00:00:35,090 --> 00:00:38,829
-Oso if it is sunshine, night or fog

8
00:01:11,214 --> 00:01:16,219
In the combat management center, information from Radar, Sonar and other sensors is presented.

9
00:01:16,219 --> 00:01:18,389
It is thus from here the battle is led.

10
00:01:18,789 --> 00:01:20,904
The radar can see aircraft and other vessels.

11
00:01:20,904 --> 00:01:25,117
The sonar shows what is below the water surface, such as mines or submarines

12
00:01:25,173 --> 00:01:28,859
In here, messages are also sent and received to other vessels.

13
00:01:29,079 --> 00:01:33,000
Like all other work on board, it is a teamwork where everyone is helped.

14
00:02:02,889 --> 00:02:06,237
On board a mine clearance vessel you live in two- or five years.

15
00:02:06,237 --> 00:02:11,414
When the ship is at sea, half the crew normally works while the other half rests.

16
00:02:11,631 --> 00:02:13,066
You work in six-hour guards-

17
00:02:13,633 --> 00:02:16,026
-sex hours of work followed by six hours of rest

18
00:02:16,026 --> 00:02:20,441
When to eat, exercise, sleep, clean or do something else.

19
00:02:49,936 --> 00:02:53,173
Here in the Sweep Duk there are, among other things, our underwater vehicles.

20
00:02:53,173 --> 00:02:55,992
They are remote-controlled unmanned underwater vessels-

21
00:02:55,992 --> 00:03:01,428
-As used to film and harm minor found.

22
00:03:38,084 --> 00:03:41,521
Here in the fair we eat and this is also where we watch TV or relax.

23
00:03:42,230 --> 00:03:46,734
When the ship is at sea, you eat every six hours divided into two different guards.

24
00:03:46,993 --> 00:03:49,189
The fairs also act as a health care location-

25
00:03:49,189 --> 00:03:52,459
-And, for example, to lead firefighting on board.

26
00:04:11,013 --> 00:04:15,429
On board are two chefs who cook for the more than 30 people in the crew.

27
00:04:15,513 --> 00:04:18,227
At sea they cook food every six hours.

28
00:04:39,412 --> 00:04:44,284
In the engine room there are four main engines that run Voith Schneider the propellers.

29
00:04:44,684 --> 00:04:48,254
These allow the ship to maintain a speed of about 15 knots.

30
00:04:48,688 --> 00:04:52,258
However, when looking for mines you drive a lot more slowly.

31
00:04:52,659 --> 00:04:56,696
There are also generators that make electricity, boilers that make hot water-

32
00:04:56,696 --> 00:05:02,224
And osmosis units that manufacture drinking water from salt water and many other technical equipment.
