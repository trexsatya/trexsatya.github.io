1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,380
I'll just make a good intro.

2
00:00:02,380 --> 00:00:04,496
Shabla!
 Shabla Shabla!

3
00:00:04,496 --> 00:00:08,943
Ohh, good transition.
 We stand here outside Berlin Airport.
 -Guten Morgen!

4
00:00:08,943 --> 00:00:11,342
Right next to a vibrant pikachu, check out there!

5
00:00:11,342 --> 00:00:13,744
Gotta catch'em all!

6
00:00:13,744 --> 00:00:17,617
What has not happened before in a "on the space" section is that Niklas has escaped.

7
00:00:17,617 --> 00:00:21,063
There are several who commented on it, and your comments are our team!

8
00:00:21,063 --> 00:00:22,949
We do what you say!

9
00:00:22,949 --> 00:00:26,158
Well, our next plan is really to go to the United States, -

10
00:00:26,158 --> 00:00:30,213
-Asia or something.
 But we thought we squeeze one when Niklas can run like hell!

11
00:00:30,213 --> 00:00:32,323
It's not so fun to do it himself, so he has his friend Oskar with him.

12
00:00:32,323 --> 00:00:34,939
Here we have.
 - Applause!
 Applause.

13
00:00:34,939 --> 00:00:36,868
Niklas and Oskar!

14
00:00:36,868 --> 00:00:38,049
Versus jlc,

15
00:00:38,049 --> 00:00:42,470
That's what is fun.
 The entire JLC against Niklas and Oskar.

16
00:00:42,470 --> 00:00:45,024
The rules are clear, as they always are.

17
00:00:45,024 --> 00:00:47,277
There is new info every half hour.

18
00:00:47,277 --> 00:00:48,944
You have to stay on the spot for five minutes.

19
00:00:48,944 --> 00:00:52,620
Every other time it is picture and then pin location.

20
00:00:52,620 --> 00:00:56,164
And you must not go to ******-club without calling us first.

21
00:00:56,164 --> 00:00:58,214
No, goalkeeper.
 - Ah ... ah.

22
00:00:58,214 --> 00:01:00,647
Set timer in 30 minutes.

23
00:01:00,647 --> 00:01:03,856
So!
 Stick away, stick away!

24
00:01:03,856 --> 00:01:06,912
Shall we jump in there?
 - No, it's a person in there.

25
00:01:06,912 --> 00:01:09,447
Shall we jump in?
 We jump in.

26
00:01:09,447 --> 00:01:15,255
This is how: I have read German in high school and there is a bit left.

27
00:01:15,255 --> 00:01:17,261
Order, yes I can actually do that.

28
00:01:24,766 --> 00:01:26,372
We'll take it over there.

29
00:01:32,044 --> 00:01:34,707
Cheers guys!
 - Cheers.

30
00:01:34,707 --> 00:01:37,020
How long do you think it takes to find them?

31
00:01:37,020 --> 00:01:41,032
I think an hour and a half from they go.

32
00:01:41,032 --> 00:01:42,630
For four hours I can guarantee.

33
00:01:42,630 --> 00:01:44,020
Niklas will fight as hell I think.

34
00:01:44,020 --> 00:01:51,562
At least we are now on our way towards the very core that we should be around.

35
00:01:51,562 --> 00:01:56,697
Where we go now we are about 500 meters away, I do not know.

36
00:01:56,697 --> 00:01:57,913
It looks very close anyway.

37
00:01:57,913 --> 00:02:04,539
And we saw a hotel there that seemed fun and that is something that the guys may not appreciate ...

38
00:02:04,539 --> 00:02:06,502
I don't know, we'll see, we'll see ...

39
00:02:06,502 --> 00:02:08,105
Can I take a selfie with you?

40
00:02:10,733 --> 00:02:12,630
Thank you so much!

41
00:02:12,630 --> 00:02:13,776
Now Sent Niklas Photo!

42
00:02:13,776 --> 00:02:16,108
It's a taxis driver!
 - They became more polished with him!

43
00:02:16,108 --> 00:02:19,273
Yes but we can be polar with ours too.

44
00:02:19,273 --> 00:02:22,464
But then we just chance and go right in.

45
00:02:22,464 --> 00:02:27,860
I think it was when we checked the map Jonas, what was it?
 36 minutes type.

46
00:02:27,860 --> 00:02:31,795
So we will have 6 minutes left when he sends location, that's good!

47
00:02:31,795 --> 00:02:34,407
Then we just say: Drive there instead!

48
00:02:48,433 --> 00:02:52,831
I really want this caravan room ... - we may need to look further?

49
00:02:52,831 --> 00:02:58,254
The plan was that we would have a caravan holiday stuck in Germany.

50
00:02:58,254 --> 00:02:59,854
In the middle of Berlin!
 - In the middle of Berlin yes!

51
00:02:59,854 --> 00:03:03,228
And then I had found these, you can see the picture here:

52
00:03:03,228 --> 00:03:04,475
So I swap like this:

53
00:03:04,475 --> 00:03:07,479
You see, you see, yes.

54
00:03:07,479 --> 00:03:08,892
Yes anyway, you take.

55
00:03:08,892 --> 00:03:11,757
Then we go inward towards the State Care.

56
00:03:11,757 --> 00:03:15,876
It's a bit risky, we are ... - We're out on the outskirts after all.

57
00:03:15,876 --> 00:03:17,901
Ah that's us.
 - We have to get inward.

58
00:03:17,901 --> 00:03:21,585
We currently shared the place info.

59
00:03:21,585 --> 00:03:25,458
I first happened to share live, but I don't know so I wrote to them.

60
00:03:25,458 --> 00:03:29,126
"Check so it's not live".
 Then they cheat if they always see where I am.

61
00:03:29,126 --> 00:03:30,257
We'll wait here for five minutes now.

62
00:03:30,257 --> 00:03:35,141
We just have to go on!
 I saw the pendulum going up here.

63
00:03:35,141 --> 00:03:39,606
So we just have to take something like that and move on, because they can take a taxi.
 They can be here anywhere.

64
00:03:39,606 --> 00:03:43,847
This is so damn good.
 Niklas has sent a pin now.

65
00:03:43,847 --> 00:03:46,955
Do you think they sat in taxi when he sent it there?
 - Nah.

66
00:03:46,955 --> 00:03:49,086
It's a hotel somewhere there.

67
00:03:49,086 --> 00:03:54,156
We are sitting in a taxi now, we are going there now, now now.

68
00:03:54,156 --> 00:03:55,197
Yes, say he goes there.

69
00:03:55,197 --> 00:03:58,629
We have fourteen minutes.

70
00:03:58,629 --> 00:04:00,530
Is it so far?
 - Ah.

71
00:04:00,530 --> 00:04:02,599
Now it has been five minutes.

72
00:04:02,599 --> 00:04:06,045
And we're going to move away now.
 We take the commute!

73
00:04:06,045 --> 00:04:10,078
It's Berghein and the football arena here.

74
00:04:10,078 --> 00:04:13,581
I promise to Calle and they think I will go there.

75
00:04:13,581 --> 00:04:15,474
There and pave it as well.

76
00:04:15,474 --> 00:04:17,948
But no, I'll take the commute.

77
00:04:17,948 --> 00:04:20,960
What the hell is Niklas doing here?
 Why right here?

78
00:04:20,960 --> 00:04:22,614
Here you have, here you have the Döner.

79
00:04:22,614 --> 00:04:24,061
Should we drive a dunner?

80
00:04:24,061 --> 00:04:25,904
We drive a dunner.
 - It's good Döner here huh?

81
00:04:25,904 --> 00:04:27,505
Type all the dousies are good here I think.

82
00:04:27,505 --> 00:04:28,899
Yes we drive a dunner.

83
00:04:28,899 --> 00:04:32,150
There is a bus 14:12 from here I saw, I forgot to check before.

84
00:04:32,150 --> 00:04:35,527
It is 15:08 and we will send location in 12 minutes.

85
00:04:35,527 --> 00:04:40,028
We will send a picture on the bus if we do not notice that we will be off the map.

86
00:04:40,028 --> 00:04:41,253
Then we jump off before.

87
00:04:41,253 --> 00:04:44,842
We must also find a place to jaw, we have not done that today.

88
00:04:44,842 --> 00:04:47,578
I am swine hungry, I just cooked a sandwich this morning and a cup of coffee.

89
00:04:47,578 --> 00:04:49,788
Do you get it?
 Bread!
 Mmm.

90
00:04:49,788 --> 00:04:53,411
What if you could buy one like this at home?
 40 bucks.

91
00:04:53,411 --> 00:04:55,684
Ah fuck what good.

92
00:04:55,684 --> 00:04:58,899
I have never tested this before.
 Döner-Kebab.

93
00:04:58,899 --> 00:04:59,856
Don't have it?
 - No.

94
00:04:59,856 --> 00:05:05,134
Is it a special type of kebab or?
 - Much better than the one we jaw at home.

95
00:05:06,621 --> 00:05:09,105
Oh!
 It's any other sauce?
 - Yes.

96
00:05:09,105 --> 00:05:12,020
This was good.
 - Spring Spring!

97
00:05:14,518 --> 00:05:17,016
You're joking!
 - No!

98
00:05:17,016 --> 00:05:18,516
!

99
00:05:18,516 --> 00:05:20,276
What the hell are we doing?

100
00:05:20,276 --> 00:05:21,892
There is a bus too?

101
00:05:21,892 --> 00:05:25,579
We'll take it then?
 We take the one we take it!
 Jump!

102
00:05:28,229 --> 00:05:30,879
Yes yes!
 - Thank you!

103
00:05:30,879 --> 00:05:33,276
Aahh, my ass.

104
00:05:33,276 --> 00:05:36,934
Where do we go?

105
00:05:36,934 --> 00:05:38,709
Should I ask someone or?

106
00:05:38,709 --> 00:05:43,576
Ok, we're on the map where this bus is going.
 Okay so this is going like further?

107
00:05:43,576 --> 00:05:46,922
So it's not going anywhere soon to the center?
 - No.

108
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:52,642
We have to jump off here.
 - We have gone in the wrong direction.

109
00:05:52,642 --> 00:05:54,654
Yeah.
 So we have to take the next bus the other way.

110
00:05:54,654 --> 00:05:56,810
It's a bus in that direction!

111
00:05:59,716 --> 00:06:02,897
I'll send a picture in a minute so I'll take a selfie right now.

112
00:06:02,897 --> 00:06:05,730
So damn asshole.
 Check.

113
00:06:05,730 --> 00:06:08,823
He stuck right away.

114
00:06:08,823 --> 00:06:11,503
That is smart.
 - He sits on a bus.

115
00:06:11,503 --> 00:06:14,209
He has waited five minutes, he takes a bus.
 That's how they will work all day.

116
00:06:14,209 --> 00:06:16,608
So we have to be the step ahead.

117
00:06:16,608 --> 00:06:18,358
Do you know what, there are two options here:

118
00:06:18,358 --> 00:06:22,154
Either you go upwards across the bridge or whatever it was, or downwards.

119
00:06:22,154 --> 00:06:24,140
We take a taxi and then we chance.

120
00:06:24,140 --> 00:06:26,170
So we hope it will be right.

121
00:06:26,170 --> 00:06:28,493
I think they will move towards town, or the chain.

122
00:06:28,493 --> 00:06:30,959
So we are in the middle of town?

123
00:06:30,959 --> 00:06:33,525
No we have a bit into the main street itself.
 - Okay.

124
00:06:33,525 --> 00:06:38,069
Imagine: We would move here, now we're here.

125
00:06:38,069 --> 00:06:42,399
Now he sent a picture, next it will be Pin Location.

126
00:06:42,399 --> 00:06:45,367
Then we should be done with each means of transport.

127
00:06:45,367 --> 00:06:47,367
We sit in the taxi then.
 - Yes we can do that.

128
00:06:47,367 --> 00:06:49,994
Do you understand what I mean?
 We have to chance first.

129
00:06:49,994 --> 00:06:51,929
Yes.
 - Otherwise we will not be able to five.

130
00:06:51,929 --> 00:06:56,265
To chance in one direction yes.
 - I think we should chance inward towards the batter.

131
00:06:56,265 --> 00:06:57,897
Yes but then we do.

132
00:07:02,773 --> 00:07:06,398
Two beers and eh ... do you have any like ... snacks?

133
00:07:06,398 --> 00:07:08,865
Like Chestnuts or ..?
 - No.

134
00:07:08,865 --> 00:07:11,390
No like ... Lringla?

135
00:07:11,390 --> 00:07:14,644
Fries?
 - No Never Mind, I Can Take Two Beers.

136
00:07:14,689 --> 00:07:16,236
We go up and watch!

137
00:07:16,236 --> 00:07:18,996
We go up and check!
 Come come.
 What is this place?

138
00:07:18,996 --> 00:07:22,165
We sit here and take a beer!

139
00:07:22,165 --> 00:07:23,896
We see if they come here.

140
00:07:23,896 --> 00:07:26,483
We are standing outside the Döner place now.

141
00:07:26,483 --> 00:07:29,727
We will see if we get a taxi or something now and move towards the very core.

142
00:07:29,727 --> 00:07:33,454
We chance!
 He will be nearby and then we just take him.

143
00:07:33,454 --> 00:07:35,304
Hallo!

144
00:07:35,304 --> 00:07:38,496
Damn, check out what the street is called.

145
00:07:38,496 --> 00:07:41,995
No!
 The Biggest Shopping Street.

146
00:07:41,995 --> 00:07:44,523
?

147
00:07:44,523 --> 00:07:46,118
You can't say it so Calle.

148
00:07:47,393 --> 00:07:48,793
Who the hell did it down now?

149
00:07:48,793 --> 00:07:51,117
Now it smells of ass in the car.

150
00:07:51,117 --> 00:07:54,444
After all, he has fed and smoked as hell in this car.

151
00:07:54,444 --> 00:07:56,867
Just smoke smell.
 - We have looked up hotels.

152
00:07:56,867 --> 00:08:00,056
But unfortunately it was fully booked, and Lucas called me precisely-

153
00:08:00,056 --> 00:08:02,818
-And: "Where's the hotel?"
 Because they want to leave their bags.

154
00:08:02,818 --> 00:08:04,633
What a shame we couldn't take that hotel.
 - Yes.

155
00:08:04,633 --> 00:08:06,343
It would have been so damn perfect.
 But!

156
00:08:06,343 --> 00:08:10,321
Then I thought we were moving in with the bus.
 - Yes.

157
00:08:10,321 --> 00:08:14,290
We find something, we google around a bit.
 - Either the bus or the subway.

158
00:08:14,290 --> 00:08:17,126
So we just have to try to find a hotel.

159
00:08:17,126 --> 00:08:19,291
You hear the music, it's the pure party here.

160
00:08:19,291 --> 00:08:21,822
They call this busheim.

161
00:08:21,822 --> 00:08:24,329
We are not ready with the beer, or I am not at least.

162
00:08:24,329 --> 00:08:26,316
Oskar has little left too.

163
00:08:26,316 --> 00:08:29,076
It takes to leave the bus, but we almost have to.

164
00:08:29,076 --> 00:08:30,802
Bowl!

165
00:08:33,552 --> 00:08:36,302
We are sending location now anyway.

166
00:08:36,302 --> 00:08:37,838
It's too damn here Kitkatclub is located!

167
00:08:37,838 --> 00:08:39,736
What everyone sent to me at DMS.
 - Is it?

168
00:08:39,736 --> 00:08:42,298
Are you kidding, is it Kitkat Club?
 - It's a sex club?

169
00:08:42,298 --> 00:08:44,797
It's kitkat!
 He's Kitkat!

170
00:08:44,797 --> 00:08:46,198
Kitkat.

171
00:08:46,198 --> 00:08:48,208
Are they naked?

172
00:08:48,208 --> 00:08:50,814
It's this.
 Kitkat.

173
00:08:50,814 --> 00:08:52,971
How far was it?
 - Seven minutes!

174
00:08:52,971 --> 00:08:54,850
Are you kidding!
 It's so close.
 Perfect!

175
00:08:54,850 --> 00:08:56,895
He must stand there five minutes after all.
 - Yes Yes!

176
00:08:56,895 --> 00:08:58,532
Damn, we can take him now.

177
00:08:58,532 --> 00:09:04,548
We will catch our friend at the strip club.

178
00:09:08,868 --> 00:09:14,447
I sent to my Polar in Berlin and asked what I said in this Translator thing.

179
00:09:14,447 --> 00:09:18,264
That voice said we would meet our friend at a strip club.

180
00:09:22,824 --> 00:09:24,352
Here it is somewhere.

181
00:09:24,352 --> 00:09:26,052
You are here like that republic place.

182
00:09:26,052 --> 00:09:28,833
Check!
 We have to go in here.
 - I'm watching, I'm watching.

183
00:09:28,833 --> 00:09:30,805
I'm coming.

184
00:09:30,805 --> 00:09:34,055
Oh damn.
 What a damn place!

185
00:09:34,055 --> 00:09:36,224
One hundred percent that they have been here or?

186
00:09:36,224 --> 00:09:37,220
They are probably damn here.

187
00:09:37,220 --> 00:09:38,363
We go in and check.

188
00:09:38,363 --> 00:09:42,837
Excuse me?
 Have you see Two Guys with a camera here?
 - Yes.

189
00:09:42,837 --> 00:09:45,143
They were just here.
 - Oh, they left?

190
00:09:45,143 --> 00:09:47,015
They were here?
 - They were just here.

191
00:09:47,015 --> 00:09:49,015
Really?
 Okay, Thank you.

192
00:09:49,015 --> 00:09:50,035
What is the subway called?

193
00:09:50,035 --> 00:09:52,949
We are Swedes, we speak Swedish.
 - Well!

194
00:09:52,949 --> 00:09:56,397
Well.
 But which one is inward towards town?

195
00:09:56,397 --> 00:09:58,206
Not anyone here ...

196
00:09:58,206 --> 00:10:01,573
In such cases, it's over there.

197
00:10:01,573 --> 00:10:03,585
That way?
 - Yes.

198
00:10:03,585 --> 00:10:06,454
They have taken a subway!

199
00:10:06,454 --> 00:10:09,116
No, we go down.
 They will take the subway.

200
00:10:09,116 --> 00:10:10,812
Absolutely sure!

201
00:10:10,812 --> 00:10:12,951
Now it comes!

202
00:10:12,951 --> 00:10:15,293
We'll take it then!
 - Yes!

203
00:10:16,968 --> 00:10:18,332
So!
 - Let's go!

204
00:10:24,015 --> 00:10:25,965
We missed them with type two minutes.

205
00:10:28,702 --> 00:10:31,643
We have to go back.
 Or?
 - During?

206
00:10:31,643 --> 00:10:35,159
It's under the houses and everything huh?
 - Yes.

207
00:10:35,159 --> 00:10:36,919
Here they are not like.

208
00:10:36,919 --> 00:10:39,142
Now I have lost Jonas and Lucas.

209
00:10:39,142 --> 00:10:42,768
I paid the taxi and jumped out, so they are gone.

210
00:10:42,768 --> 00:10:44,400
Where the hell am I somewhere?

211
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:46,738
This wasn't good.
 What the hell...

212
00:10:46,738 --> 00:10:48,638
There they are!
 What the hell, you can't call you!

213
00:10:48,638 --> 00:10:51,187
We thought they went the subway.

214
00:10:51,187 --> 00:10:53,847
It is at the strip club, that is where he is.

215
00:10:53,847 --> 00:10:57,842
We asked at the beer place if they saw two guys with camera and then they had just left.

216
00:10:57,842 --> 00:11:00,369
Then we thought they had taken the subway.

217
00:11:00,369 --> 00:11:02,095
Yes exactly.
 A minute ago.

218
00:11:02,095 --> 00:11:04,206
The strip club is the only thing they talked about.
 It is located here.

219
00:11:04,206 --> 00:11:07,194
But he has not gone in there or?
 - Yes!

220
00:11:07,194 --> 00:11:08,819
That's the only thing he talked about.
 At the airport he said:

221
00:11:08,819 --> 00:11:10,784
"Kitkat is here"

222
00:11:10,784 --> 00:11:12,629
Yes we have to go in and check.

223
00:11:12,629 --> 00:11:14,947
Can you go in?
 - May go in?

224
00:11:14,947 --> 00:11:16,402
Yes?
 - Clearly you have to go in.

225
00:11:16,402 --> 00:11:18,107
I promise you, he has entered.
 - Should we go in here?

226
00:11:18,107 --> 00:11:20,455
Yes yes, we will find him.

227
00:11:20,455 --> 00:11:22,832
Well!
 You rush on.
 You have to ping on.

228
00:11:22,832 --> 00:11:24,551
Oh!

229
00:11:24,551 --> 00:11:26,738
We ask if Niklas is there.
 - Keep the camera a little discreet then.

230
00:11:26,738 --> 00:11:28,742
Hello We Are From Swedish Television ...

231
00:11:28,742 --> 00:11:32,100
Have you see (inaudible)?
 Horny, Blonde Short Guy?

232
00:11:32,100 --> 00:11:35,386
When does it open?
 Tonight 22-07: 00.
 - 22 tonight.

233
00:11:35,386 --> 00:11:37,021
Okay then we have to take Niklas here tonight then.

234
00:11:37,021 --> 00:11:40,338
He must have been aware that it was not open and drunk was carried at this place then.

235
00:11:40,338 --> 00:11:44,385
He might think he should film when he is outside.

236
00:11:44,385 --> 00:11:47,159
Hello!
 That's what I said from the beginning!

237
00:11:47,159 --> 00:11:49,245
Hello!
 Shall shall--

238
00:11:49,245 --> 00:11:52,630
Should he go in ...?
 - Don't you know how it smelled?

239
00:11:52,630 --> 00:11:54,392
Damn what it smells.

240
00:11:54,392 --> 00:11:57,093
They have easily been on the bus.

241
00:11:59,733 --> 00:12:02,230
Well, he hadn't dared.

242
00:12:02,230 --> 00:12:05,288
He had never dared to hide there.
 - No no no.

243
00:12:05,288 --> 00:12:07,893
Not a chance.
 It had been so stupid so ...

244
00:12:12,619 --> 00:12:15,361
Ok i'll send a picture now.
 - That is too obvious.

245
00:12:15,361 --> 00:12:19,367
Yes that is too obvious, then they take 110%.

246
00:12:19,367 --> 00:12:24,016
Should we send a picture, wait 5 minutes and then go towards a eatery a little further away anyway?

247
00:12:24,016 --> 00:12:25,664
We can't take this.

248
00:12:25,664 --> 00:12:27,289
Should I send a picture on that eateries?

249
00:12:27,289 --> 00:12:31,520
Do you want to take a picture with me?

250
00:12:31,520 --> 00:12:32,870
Very good!

251
00:12:32,870 --> 00:12:35,019
Thank you my friend.
 - Thank you!

252
00:12:35,019 --> 00:12:38,694
He sends where he is.
 Do you film Lucas?

253
00:12:38,694 --> 00:12:40,459
He sent a picture huh?
 - Yes, Alibabas.

254
00:12:40,459 --> 00:12:42,957
One and a half kilometers.
 - Ah but what the hell!

255
00:12:42,957 --> 00:12:46,309
Yes but one and a half kilometers, we take a voi!

256
00:12:46,309 --> 00:12:48,478
Do you know what is there?
 TV-Tower.

257
00:12:48,478 --> 00:12:49,928
It's a view tower.

258
00:12:49,928 --> 00:12:52,625
But we won't get there in five minutes?

259
00:12:52,625 --> 00:12:54,352
We have to drink the beer too.

260
00:12:54,352 --> 00:12:56,591
It tasted a little special, this beer huh?
 - Yes.

261
00:12:56,591 --> 00:12:58,677
A little bit?

262
00:12:58,677 --> 00:13:00,818
I have not been very impressed with the beer.

263
00:13:00,818 --> 00:13:02,989
Damn what you are picky then.

264
00:13:02,989 --> 00:13:05,956
What is the plan then?

265
00:13:05,956 --> 00:13:08,616
It's 9 minutes there by car.

266
00:13:08,616 --> 00:13:11,200
Oh damn!
 Check out the building.

267
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:14,448
We don't go there.

268
00:13:14,448 --> 00:13:15,802
Wait a little huh?

269
00:13:15,802 --> 00:13:21,835
It's nine minutes ... - Yes but then we have to sit down now.

270
00:13:21,835 --> 00:13:23,376
On a voi.

271
00:13:23,376 --> 00:13:25,042
So it is already late.

272
00:13:25,042 --> 00:13:28,873
We would have done it right away.
 It has already been two minutes now.

273
00:13:28,873 --> 00:13:34,277
It says beer and "for Sale" or "Beer Sale".

274
00:13:34,277 --> 00:13:39,524
They may have a small tingle here or a small schnitzel as well.

275
00:13:39,524 --> 00:13:41,807
Can we drink beer in here?

276
00:13:41,807 --> 00:13:44,220
There's a Restaurant in that Direction.

277
00:13:44,220 --> 00:13:46,724
That's a bottom shop.

278
00:13:46,724 --> 00:13:47,802
Where are we?

279
00:13:47,802 --> 00:13:49,985
That's why they looked like MC people ...

280
00:13:49,985 --> 00:13:51,985
We didn't dare to film them.

281
00:13:51,985 --> 00:13:54,815
But they stood there shit.
 One of them had a gun in the belt.

282
00:13:54,815 --> 00:13:59,746
Or it was just his gloves but it looked scary.

283
00:13:59,746 --> 00:14:02,328
We didn't dare to film him.
 But here is a restaurant!

284
00:14:02,328 --> 00:14:08,364
From Location, they also see this place if they go aside a bit.

285
00:14:11,641 --> 00:14:13,708
What do you recommend for food?

286
00:14:13,708 --> 00:14:18,636
(inaudible) Meatballs ...

287
00:14:18,636 --> 00:14:22,020
Can you make it in 10 minutes?

288
00:14:22,020 --> 00:14:24,340
Perfect!
 - But?

289
00:14:24,340 --> 00:14:26,999
Did he even understand what we wanted?

290
00:14:26,999 --> 00:14:30,038
I thought we would choose after!

291
00:14:30,038 --> 00:14:35,723
They took the subway!
 The stop is right there!
 - You are joking!

292
00:14:35,723 --> 00:14:37,123
They took it!
 - Yes they did!

293
00:14:37,123 --> 00:14:38,913
I think they will do it all day.

294
00:14:38,913 --> 00:14:41,795
Then we have to be in the ass on them.

295
00:14:41,795 --> 00:14:44,401
So it must have been fanemey seconds!

296
00:14:44,401 --> 00:14:46,477
There was no one in the subway when we were down there.
 - No.

297
00:14:46,477 --> 00:14:48,477
It just must have gone a bastard.

298
00:14:48,477 --> 00:14:51,269
At the TV tower they have gone there.

299
00:14:51,269 --> 00:14:55,224
What a damn ... yes you can still give them.
 They are pretty good.

300
00:14:55,224 --> 00:14:59,417
Nikla's tactics are movement all the time.

301
00:14:59,417 --> 00:15:01,667
That he even dares to have a beer here is totally sick.

302
00:15:01,667 --> 00:15:04,306
Cheers guys!
 - Cheers.

303
00:15:04,306 --> 00:15:07,254
Damn what was good.
 (?)

304
00:15:07,254 --> 00:15:08,509
Snase?

305
00:15:08,509 --> 00:15:12,820
It is 16:35 and we are completely fucked.

306
00:15:12,820 --> 00:15:15,369
We will send location in five minutes.

307
00:15:15,369 --> 00:15:17,800
We sit here with a beer-

308
00:15:17,800 --> 00:15:20,493
-And we have ordered a damn sausage plate for three people.

309
00:15:20,493 --> 00:15:22,044
And we'll push it in five minutes.

310
00:15:22,044 --> 00:15:25,320
We are going to his PIN location and we are a little late on the ball.

311
00:15:25,320 --> 00:15:28,715
Or to his picture he sent.

312
00:15:28,715 --> 00:15:31,760
Soon his PIN location will come and then we pull there immediately.

313
00:15:31,760 --> 00:15:36,316
I don't think he can flush anymore now.
 I think he is hiding somewhere.

314
00:15:36,316 --> 00:15:39,201
So we go there now.
 - Now is 50 o'clock huh?

315
00:15:39,201 --> 00:15:43,494
Just when we arrive at the old address, it's time to get a new pin so we think we are still there.

316
00:15:43,494 --> 00:15:45,816
He should send now.

317
00:15:45,816 --> 00:15:47,605
So we give it immediately and go there right away.

318
00:15:47,605 --> 00:15:50,708
Now we send to him.
 Here we have it.

319
00:15:50,708 --> 00:15:54,023
If they are left at the same, we have them close.

320
00:15:54,023 --> 00:15:56,525
We have to push us fast as hell, come on now.

321
00:15:56,525 --> 00:15:59,592
We just chew the damn sausage now then we stick.
 Five minutes left.

322
00:15:59,592 --> 00:16:02,209
Okay, we go to (street name) Five.

323
00:16:02,209 --> 00:16:03,544
It's right here!

324
00:16:03,544 --> 00:16:06,013
Okay, go go go go go!

325
00:16:06,013 --> 00:16:09,129
Sorry Sorry Sorry!

326
00:16:09,129 --> 00:16:11,956
But you...

327
00:16:11,956 --> 00:16:15,509
Damn, it's super close!
 - Go go go!

328
00:16:15,509 --> 00:16:18,149
So it's really 200 m ... - Now we have him!

329
00:16:18,149 --> 00:16:21,985
But you are a jazz club!
 It's a jazz club!

330
00:16:21,985 --> 00:16:24,521
Now we have him guys!
 - It's a jazz club!

331
00:16:24,521 --> 00:16:28,081
Excuse me?
 - No he doesn't work here, he doesn't work here ...

332
00:16:28,081 --> 00:16:30,460
No no ... nothing, nothing.

333
00:16:31,890 --> 00:16:34,525
No, he doesn't work here ...

334
00:16:35,988 --> 00:16:38,126
It's here, it's here that he has sent.

335
00:16:38,126 --> 00:16:40,476
I thought we would have him then!

336
00:16:40,476 --> 00:16:43,276
But it says over there?
 Shouldn't we just go back again?

337
00:16:43,276 --> 00:16:45,199
Should we talk to some people over there if they have seen them?

338
00:16:45,199 --> 00:16:47,470
Have you been sitting here for a long time?

339
00:16:47,470 --> 00:16:51,071
You have seen two guys in white t-shirt sitting here with a camera?

340
00:16:51,071 --> 00:16:53,550
No?
 Okay, okay.
 Thank you.

341
00:16:58,581 --> 00:17:01,456
If we do not take Niklas now you will hear it.

342
00:17:01,456 --> 00:17:04,768
Yes.
 - You want to take him just because.

343
00:17:04,768 --> 00:17:09,714
I think he is doing something or is on this street somewhere.

344
00:17:09,714 --> 00:17:12,268
It feels like things are happening.

345
00:17:12,268 --> 00:17:15,443
He is guaranteed to be somewhere up here as well.

346
00:17:15,443 --> 00:17:17,218
Up.

347
00:17:17,218 --> 00:17:19,916
So I believe in this direction.

348
00:17:19,916 --> 00:17:22,821
I think they are inside the shops here.

349
00:17:22,821 --> 00:17:25,648
Oskar and I talked about it behind the camera here but,

350
00:17:25,648 --> 00:17:28,499
Here is the water and I see some yellow boats.

351
00:17:28,499 --> 00:17:33,447
Should you take a boat or?
 I didn't know you could do it in Berlin but,

352
00:17:33,447 --> 00:17:36,412
There may be a small toad as in Gothenburg.

353
00:17:36,412 --> 00:17:38,439
Look there!
 Check!

354
00:17:40,301 --> 00:17:42,758
There's no alcohol on the boat right?
 - Yes.

355
00:17:42,758 --> 00:17:46,372
Is it?
 - Yes, yes.

356
00:17:46,372 --> 00:17:48,338
Aaah!

357
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:52,165
We should send a picture and I was going to ask her but I don't think she wants to be in the picture.

358
00:17:52,165 --> 00:17:55,320
But now they will realize that we are on a boat.

359
00:17:55,320 --> 00:17:57,990
What should I send?
 - Can't you send on a building?

360
00:17:57,990 --> 00:17:59,994
Well I can do that!

361
00:17:59,994 --> 00:18:01,784
I'll send on this one.

362
00:18:01,784 --> 00:18:04,027
It is very in zoomy anyway.

363
00:18:04,027 --> 00:18:06,192
That's it, yes.

364
00:18:06,192 --> 00:18:08,978
Yes it is, do you see the top of it somewhere?

365
00:18:08,978 --> 00:18:10,531
No, into a taxi fast as hell.

366
00:18:10,531 --> 00:18:12,265
We are as close there.
 Asbelled.

367
00:18:12,265 --> 00:18:16,309
Checkpoint Charlie.
 When I pressed it, a picture came up on that building.

368
00:18:16,309 --> 00:18:18,766
Yes it is just because you see it from there.
 Ass sex.

369
00:18:18,766 --> 00:18:20,350
I go in and check.

370
00:18:20,350 --> 00:18:22,909
I have it, I have it!
 I have it!

371
00:18:22,909 --> 00:18:26,647
A museum or?
 - Yes here is.

372
00:18:26,647 --> 00:18:28,395
Berlin Cathedral is called it.

373
00:18:28,395 --> 00:18:30,301
No, museum.
 - Museum Island is it.

374
00:18:30,301 --> 00:18:33,278
Museum Island.
 - Berlin Cathedral stands here.

375
00:18:33,278 --> 00:18:35,012
Is he on something else then or?

376
00:18:35,012 --> 00:18:37,296
It is the.
 6 minutes.
 It's the church.

377
00:18:37,296 --> 00:18:39,601
6 minutes to take a car, yes.

378
00:18:39,601 --> 00:18:41,130
And go then?

379
00:18:41,130 --> 00:18:44,443
A quarter to go.
 - There we have a voi, should we take it?

380
00:18:44,443 --> 00:18:46,041
Yes we do.

381
00:18:46,041 --> 00:18:52,355
Excuse me?
 I don't have to movie if you want to but how long is this bus going for?

382
00:18:52,355 --> 00:18:56,090
An hour.
 - An hour, Oskar.

383
00:18:56,090 --> 00:18:59,059
We may send location into the water then.

384
00:18:59,059 --> 00:19:00,926
Where is it going?

385
00:19:00,926 --> 00:19:03,281
I'm Not Sure.

386
00:19:03,281 --> 00:19:06,690
Should I ask her to the left if she wants to film us when we take one?

387
00:19:06,690 --> 00:19:08,436
Should I do it?

388
00:19:08,436 --> 00:19:11,910
Excuse me?
 Can you movie us when we take the shot?

389
00:19:16,717 --> 00:19:19,147
Was it good?
 - Yes.

390
00:19:19,147 --> 00:19:21,825
Ok, thank you so much.

391
00:19:21,825 --> 00:19:25,810
We realized that scooters are the best option.

392
00:19:25,810 --> 00:19:29,508
Is it the right path?
 How far is Calle left?

393
00:19:32,668 --> 00:19:34,668
200?
 Have you put in wrong?

394
00:19:34,668 --> 00:19:37,679
I have pressed the wrong button I think.
 - No?

395
00:19:37,679 --> 00:19:40,100
Thought where the hell are we on our way now ... - I've put in the wrong button.

396
00:19:40,100 --> 00:19:41,697
What are we taking now?

397
00:19:41,697 --> 00:19:44,474
You're joking Calle?
 - No?

398
00:19:44,474 --> 00:19:46,903
Well for hell!

399
00:19:46,903 --> 00:19:48,794
How far is it now?
 - Not so far.

400
00:19:48,794 --> 00:19:52,204
How far is it now?
 - I can not take it.

401
00:19:52,204 --> 00:19:54,527
Cheers again!

402
00:19:57,671 --> 00:20:02,456
We have been drinking our Aperol Spritz here.
 Not ready.
 And shots down.

403
00:20:02,456 --> 00:20:07,423
But we have been going for 20 minutes now.

404
00:20:07,423 --> 00:20:10,271
It takes an hour.
 Now in 10 minutes I'll send location.

405
00:20:10,271 --> 00:20:13,971
Then I think we will turn around.
 Or what do you think Oskar?

406
00:20:13,971 --> 00:20:14,885
Yes it feels so.

407
00:20:14,885 --> 00:20:17,493
Then it will be perfect because then we will send location and-

408
00:20:17,493 --> 00:20:20,208
-We can't stand still on that location.

409
00:20:20,208 --> 00:20:22,267
After all, we can't help we go a boat as well.

410
00:20:30,436 --> 00:20:35,352
There is the police.
 It looks like the police are following Carl and Jonas.

411
00:20:35,352 --> 00:20:39,082
Well they don't do that?
 Well it does!

412
00:20:39,082 --> 00:20:41,360
Check out Vettu.
 The cop is coming.

413
00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:44,956
If you look at the Traffic Light ...

414
00:20:44,956 --> 00:20:46,405
So sorry.

415
00:20:46,405 --> 00:20:49,548
We will just fine you 200 euros.

416
00:20:49,548 --> 00:20:54,607
If you are not from Germany you have to pay now.

417
00:20:54,607 --> 00:20:56,548
We did not see that.

418
00:20:56,548 --> 00:21:00,672
If you promise you don't do it again ... - we promise you!

419
00:21:00,672 --> 00:21:02,344
Then go for it.

420
00:21:02,344 --> 00:21:05,082
Have a great day.
 - Thank you!

421
00:21:05,082 --> 00:21:07,755
Damn what a go 'police.
 - He was absolutely wonderful.

422
00:21:07,755 --> 00:21:10,903
You drove towards red, I said that the cop was after.

423
00:21:10,903 --> 00:21:13,360
Did you see that he held up a sign like that?

424
00:21:13,360 --> 00:21:16,772
Jonas just: Stay it's cops!
 Did you hear what I said then?

425
00:21:16,772 --> 00:21:18,763
"What the hell do you want now then your fucking snap pig?"

426
00:21:18,763 --> 00:21:21,488
Do you know what I said?
 You can go to hell, I still go.

427
00:21:21,488 --> 00:21:24,114
It wasn't the point but it was such a damn big intersection ...

428
00:21:24,114 --> 00:21:26,049
Red Light?

429
00:21:26,049 --> 00:21:28,249
I HAVE NOT SEEN RED LIGHT!

430
00:21:28,249 --> 00:21:29,592
For Real?

431
00:21:29,592 --> 00:21:32,811
No?
 Is it for real?

432
00:21:32,811 --> 00:21:34,637
Did you get it?

433
00:21:34,637 --> 00:21:37,243
"So Sorry We Didn't See That" - Do you know what I was thinking?

434
00:21:37,243 --> 00:21:42,478
"Don't you drive to red Calle?"
 Yes, shit the same!

435
00:21:42,478 --> 00:21:46,244
We have looked here now, there are several options.
 One is over there.

436
00:21:46,244 --> 00:21:47,872
One is there.

437
00:21:47,872 --> 00:21:53,581
Where the hell have you led us?
 You led us wrong, then you were taken by the cop.

438
00:21:53,581 --> 00:21:55,704
We get a pin in 10 minutes.

439
00:21:55,704 --> 00:21:59,508
We are in the right area, we go to Waynes Coffee.

440
00:21:59,508 --> 00:22:01,251
Yes a coffee yes!

441
00:22:01,251 --> 00:22:05,406
Wine and coffee it says!

442
00:22:05,406 --> 00:22:08,497
Here we have Wayne Coffee!

443
00:22:12,132 --> 00:22:14,567
Such fucking Swedish tourists ...

444
00:22:14,567 --> 00:22:17,538
Wines Coffee ...

445
00:22:17,538 --> 00:22:19,595
Wine and coffee!

446
00:22:19,595 --> 00:22:23,528
Jamen Waynes Coffee is a chain!

447
00:22:23,528 --> 00:22:27,130
Yes I know that but it's so fun, Wayne Coffee ... Wine and Coffee.

448
00:22:32,517 --> 00:22:35,524
Thank you!

449
00:22:35,524 --> 00:22:37,746
Thank you!

450
00:22:37,746 --> 00:22:40,595
He sends location in three minutes.

451
00:22:40,595 --> 00:22:44,204
Can in Also have a cappucino?

452
00:22:44,204 --> 00:22:47,174
A cappucino?
 - Yeah it's okay.

453
00:22:47,174 --> 00:22:51,404
He is sending three minutes now, what the hell are you doing?

454
00:22:51,404 --> 00:22:53,812
We are going to pull now?

455
00:22:53,812 --> 00:22:57,736
After you have been out and traveled a scooter, it is good with a small beer.

456
00:22:57,736 --> 00:22:59,876
We're really bad now.

457
00:22:59,876 --> 00:23:02,483
Why are we sitting here drinking coffee?

458
00:23:02,483 --> 00:23:04,316
Transition.

459
00:23:04,316 --> 00:23:10,564
Then I send here ... wait.
 - And we are turning to turn so it's perfect.

460
00:23:10,564 --> 00:23:14,361
Send location here and we're on our way back.

461
00:23:14,361 --> 00:23:17,144
I have sent now.
 Jonas has read it a minute ago.

462
00:23:17,144 --> 00:23:19,392
But he sees that we are in the water.

463
00:23:19,392 --> 00:23:21,448
Do you see that we are outside then?

464
00:23:21,448 --> 00:23:23,366
Fuck!
 He sees it.

465
00:23:23,366 --> 00:23:25,872
He's in a boat.
 Check this out.

466
00:23:25,872 --> 00:23:28,334
There you see.

467
00:23:28,334 --> 00:23:31,746
Niklas is exactly on such a boat.
 Check.

468
00:23:31,746 --> 00:23:37,441
It is an entimat ride, it is the only thing that goes.

469
00:23:37,441 --> 00:23:40,945
If it is an hour turn, then we can stand there when he is back.
 Right?

470
00:23:40,945 --> 00:23:43,496
Then we take the voi there.

471
00:23:43,496 --> 00:23:45,099
Check out his ass.

472
00:23:45,099 --> 00:23:47,104
But what in hell ... does he have string?

473
00:23:47,104 --> 00:23:49,684
Gosh!

474
00:23:49,684 --> 00:23:52,592
He had string!

475
00:23:52,592 --> 00:23:55,620
But what the hell?

476
00:23:55,620 --> 00:23:57,832
What is happening here?

477
00:23:57,832 --> 00:24:00,950
He goes with the jeans in the knee and has a string on?

478
00:24:00,950 --> 00:24:02,667
What the hell...

479
00:24:02,667 --> 00:24:07,418
Now we are close to land and Jonas wrote that they are waiting for us on land.

480
00:24:07,418 --> 00:24:12,934
So I'm not sure how to solve that situation.

481
00:24:12,934 --> 00:24:17,074
We have to hide down there I think because I have to pee too.

482
00:24:17,074 --> 00:24:19,485
Should we pee and wait down there?

483
00:24:19,485 --> 00:24:24,753
The first activity I go boat and they know where you go off and off.

484
00:24:24,753 --> 00:24:27,587
It's so damn hard.
 It is much more difficult than you think.

485
00:24:27,587 --> 00:24:33,237
You hear how the police come after Lucas now, he has been in ... riots.

486
00:24:33,237 --> 00:24:38,643
We have taken the wrong cathedral first.
 They have been farthest farthest over there.

487
00:24:38,643 --> 00:24:41,915
The station is located just as well.

488
00:24:41,915 --> 00:24:43,630
He has been here very much you can say.
 - Yes.

489
00:24:43,630 --> 00:24:45,366
He has been in this area.

490
00:24:45,366 --> 00:24:50,255
The best thing about this boat trip is that it comes back in the same place.

491
00:24:50,255 --> 00:24:53,653
If that is true, we have type 10 minutes to go there and catch him.

492
00:24:53,653 --> 00:24:56,235
Then we take him when he comes back with the boat.

493
00:24:56,235 --> 00:24:58,672
It is no more difficult than that.

494
00:24:58,672 --> 00:25:02,800
There it is Lucas!
 It is the!

495
00:25:02,800 --> 00:25:06,288
Here they have been yes.
 - And here's the boat.

496
00:25:08,329 --> 00:25:11,486
Jonas wrote that they know that we are on a boat.

497
00:25:11,486 --> 00:25:18,441
So we'll try to wait here and see if they even find us.

498
00:25:18,441 --> 00:25:20,466
They can just as well sit under deck there.

499
00:25:20,466 --> 00:25:23,107
Niklas can easily sit under there as well.

500
00:25:23,107 --> 00:25:27,427
It will go there in the same place.
 So it might as well be it.
 - Yes exactly.

501
00:25:27,427 --> 00:25:29,031
They will try to catch us up there.

502
00:25:29,031 --> 00:25:30,764
Yes...

503
00:25:37,140 --> 00:25:39,075
Listen what she says ...

504
00:25:39,075 --> 00:25:44,483
Yes, she says "Jonas is over there".

505
00:25:51,337 --> 00:25:53,693
No you are kidding me!

506
00:25:53,693 --> 00:25:57,709
Hello brother!

507
00:25:57,709 --> 00:26:00,075
Hello!

508
00:26:00,075 --> 00:26:03,615
But you are not all together!

509
00:26:03,615 --> 00:26:05,409
The two stay.

510
00:26:05,409 --> 00:26:07,553
They stand there.
 Come!
 - He has found them.

511
00:26:07,553 --> 00:26:09,323
He has them.
 They were there!

512
00:26:09,323 --> 00:26:11,095
Does he film or?
 - Yes!

513
00:26:11,095 --> 00:26:14,458
Oh hell what good.
 Damn what a good thing!

514
00:26:14,458 --> 00:26:16,080
They were there!

515
00:26:16,080 --> 00:26:18,780
We went to that boat over there and: it went just!

516
00:26:18,780 --> 00:26:20,961
And so: Here comes a boat too!

517
00:26:20,961 --> 00:26:23,738
And then I saw your white ... - I saw you when you got up there!

518
00:26:23,738 --> 00:26:27,510
I would go by and so I saw-

519
00:26:27,510 --> 00:26:29,562
I saw you go with a fucking goopro ...

520
00:26:29,562 --> 00:26:33,693
Here we have them!
 - You, the sick was ...

521
00:26:33,693 --> 00:26:36,442
Damn what a good thing!
 - Do you know what we were talking about?

522
00:26:36,442 --> 00:26:39,921
More boats came in and we thought: There are as many boats here!

523
00:26:39,921 --> 00:26:44,419
I saw the white sweater and some black stuff on, and that was just before I would go to you!

524
00:26:44,419 --> 00:26:47,445
And then I saw Niklas coming ...

525
00:26:47,445 --> 00:26:49,193
We only heard "Faaan!"

526
00:26:49,193 --> 00:26:52,380
He has 40 minutes left.
 Then time had been out.

527
00:26:52,380 --> 00:26:54,300
Holy shit.

528
00:26:54,300 --> 00:26:56,089
But you were great!

529
00:26:56,089 --> 00:26:59,614
Ah!
 Damn what boring!

530
00:26:59,614 --> 00:27:03,555
But do you know what ... - were you there at the strip club?

531
00:27:03,555 --> 00:27:05,715
We rang.
 - You've been there?

532
00:27:05,715 --> 00:27:13,556
