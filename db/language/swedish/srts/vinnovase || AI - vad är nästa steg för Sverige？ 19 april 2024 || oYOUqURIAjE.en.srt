1
00:00:01.245 --> 00:00:02.345
Hello and welcome.

2
00:00:02.774 --> 00:00:06.544
My name is Fredrik Weisner and I lead Vinnova's Digital change area.

3
00:00:07.654 --> 00:00:11.584
Today we will discuss what a next step in Sweden's AI development can look like.

4
00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:16.797
We will do that together with an exciting panel of five persons

5
00:00:16.797 --> 00:00:18.877
which stands in the middle of AI development.

6
00:00:19.438 --> 00:00:21.668
Hello and warm welcome to the panel.

7
00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:27.259
The reason we invited to this panel discussion

8
00:00:27.259 --> 00:00:31.169
Is because AI development now goes fast and has come a long way.

9
00:00:32.134 --> 00:00:36.940
It is also clear what great values can be created with AI today.

10
00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:40.756
In order for us to be able to take advantage of AI fully as a country

11
00:00:41.214 --> 00:00:45.374
for both a better society and our global competitiveness-

12
00:00:46.956 --> 00:00:50.356
Sweden needs to take a big next step in its AI trip.

13
00:00:50.356 --> 00:00:52.806
That is what we at Vinnova consider need to happen.

14
00:00:53.404 --> 00:00:55.464
That is what we are here to discuss.

15
00:00:56.926 --> 00:01:00.436
I think we continue with an introduction of you in the panel.

16
00:01:02.562 --> 00:01:05.142
Can you tell me what you are working on

17
00:01:05.142 --> 00:01:08.842
And how have you been involved in the AI area in recent years?

18
00:01:09.228 --> 00:01:11.378
We start with you, Evelina.

19
00:01:11.866 --> 00:01:13.306
Hello.
 -Yes, hello.

20
00:01:13.642 --> 00:01:16.152
It's fun to be here.
 I am called Evelina Anttila.

21
00:01:16.152 --> 00:01:20.920
I am CEO of a venture capital company called Wellstreet.

22
00:01:20.307 --> 00:01:22.927
We invest in early tech companies.

23
00:01:22.927 --> 00:01:27.997
Very exciting times now with AI and all the opportunities that bring with it.

24
00:01:27.997 --> 00:01:32.717
Both new opportunities, but also apply to existing portfolio companies.

25
00:01:32.992 --> 00:01:35.962
I have been working with AI for the past eight years soon.

26
00:01:35.962 --> 00:01:39.262
I was involved in building up one of those

27
00:01:39.262 --> 00:01:42.082
First major AI companies in Sweden, Peltarion.

28
00:01:43.131 --> 00:01:47.696
I have been involved since then in questions related to both

29
00:01:47.696 --> 00:01:52.806
Ethical and legal challenges, especially when it comes to AI.

30
00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:54.900
I have a background as a lawyer

31
00:01:54.900 --> 00:01:58.800
So there are also questions for the reason that is close to the heart.

32
00:01:58.800 --> 00:01:59.140
Fun to be here.

33
00:02:00.224 --> 00:02:01.164
Thanks, Evelina.

34
00:02:01.307 --> 00:02:03.447
Then we move on to you, Martin.

35
00:02:04.312 --> 00:02:07.635
You are CEO of AI Sweden.
 What is it for something

36
00:02:08.924 --> 00:02:12.264
Yes, I am a managing director at AI Sweden.

37
00:02:12.264 --> 00:02:17.134
AI Sweden is a non -profit program in Sweden, you could say.

38
00:02:17.134 --> 00:02:21.854
A national center to push the application of AI, simply.

39
00:02:22.441 --> 00:02:26.171
We work broadly across sector boundaries in Sweden.

40
00:02:26.171 --> 00:02:31.541
Everything from small private companies to large, public sectors and academia.

41
00:02:31.927 --> 00:02:36.270
And in collaboration try to drive and get forward faster.

42
00:02:37.861 --> 00:02:38.891
Thanks, Martin.

43
00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:41.330
Then we move on to you, Sara.

44
00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:45.170
What do you work with and how have you been involved in the Ai area in recent years?

45
00:02:46.742 --> 00:02:50.120
Hi, my name is Sara Mazur.
 It's fun to be here.

46
00:02:50.337 --> 00:02:53.807
I am an executive member of the Knut and Alice Wallenberg Foundation.

47
00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:59.506
I have worked with AI for more than 10 years.

48
00:03:00.354 --> 00:03:04.332
For the past 9 years I have been very active in the Wise program.

49
00:03:04.332 --> 00:03:07.602
First as Deputy Chairman, then as chairman.

50
00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:12.440
Before that, in my previous role as head of research at Ericsson

51
00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:15.410
was AI one of the areas we focused a lot on.

52
00:03:16.213 --> 00:03:19.643
For those of you who are not aware of, Knut and Alice Wallenberg's Foundation

53
00:03:19.643 --> 00:03:22.553
Sweden's largest private research financier.

54
00:03:22.922 --> 00:03:27.130
We fund basic research in Sweden in science, medicine and technology

55
00:03:27.130 --> 00:03:29.292
with over SEK 2 billion each year.

56
00:03:29.645 --> 00:03:32.955
Our largest strategic program is the Wise program:

57
00:03:32.955 --> 00:03:36.105
Wallenberg AI Autonomous Systems and Software Program.

58
00:03:38.467 --> 00:03:40.567
Thank you very much, exciting.

59
00:03:41.339 --> 00:03:45.179
Then we move on to you, Johan.
 Are you kind and tell us who you are

60
00:03:46.844 --> 00:03:51.597
Absolutely.
 Johan Harvard is my name and I work at Silo AI.

61
00:03:51.923 --> 00:03:56.233
We are perhaps quite unknown to many, but mainly work behind the scenes

62
00:03:56.233 --> 00:03:59.633
with many of Europe's and the Nordic region's largest companies.

63
00:03:59.633 --> 00:04:02.530
What we do is in principle to build uneasy solutions.

64
00:04:02.207 --> 00:04:07.437
We have customers like Ericsson, SKF, Scania, Assa Abloy in the Nordic countries

65
00:04:07.437 --> 00:04:11.527
But also large companies and customers in Europe and North America.

66
00:04:11.527 --> 00:04:15.447
We also have AI training and train language models-

67
00:04:15.447 --> 00:04:17.377
with focus on Nordic language-

68
00:04:17.706 --> 00:04:20.836
Like not the other players has as much focus on.

69
00:04:21.740 --> 00:04:25.714
I have a background from the Government Offices, where I held AI issues for several years-

70
00:04:25.714 --> 00:04:28.584
and something called Combient, which is a collaborative-

71
00:04:28.584 --> 00:04:33.604
Between some of Sweden's largest companies, where AI was of course also central.

72
00:04:35.833 --> 00:04:36.993
Thanks so much, Johan.

73
00:04:37.780 --> 00:04:41.780
Last but not least we have you, Göran.
 Are you kind and introduce yourself

74
00:04:48.571 --> 00:04:50.210
Could you be mute: ad

75
00:04:50.225 --> 00:04:52.650
I was mute: ad.
 -Let's go.

76
00:04:52.650 --> 00:04:55.215
Thank you, Fredrik.
 Fun to be here.

77
00:04:55.711 --> 00:05:02.308
I have worked for quite a few years with AI.
 I figured out that it is 39 years now

78
00:05:02.308 --> 00:05:06.638
So I must replace what I lack in quality with quantity.

79
00:05:07.925 --> 00:05:12.115
I have mainly been engaged in being a serial contractor over the years-

80
00:05:12.115 --> 00:05:15.150
And driven various scaleups forward.

81
00:05:15.748 --> 00:05:19.138
I have also been a number of years at the Government Offices.

82
00:05:19.138 --> 00:05:23.808
In recent years I have worked a lot with Martin

83
00:05:23.808 --> 00:05:26.318
Who is here, at AI Sweden as well.

84
00:05:28.135 --> 00:05:34.975
I have been seven years in the United States during the Ai-Revolution that happened in North America-

85
00:05:34.975 --> 00:05:38.535
But has been back in Sweden for just over a year.

86
00:05:39.226 --> 00:05:42.546
At the moment I happen to work in the United States.

87
00:05:43.599 --> 00:05:47.769
Otherwise, I work a lot with advice to larger companies.

88
00:05:47.769 --> 00:05:51.559
I work a lot with lectures and some investigations and such.

89
00:05:52.733 --> 00:05:53.794
That's my background.

90
00:05:55.622 --> 00:05:57.492
Thanks so much.

91
00:05:57.882 --> 00:06:00.312
Good, then we have the panel introduced.

92
00:06:00.719 --> 00:06:04.319
If we take out the picture on today's agenda, it looks like this.

93
00:06:07.299 --> 00:06:11.259
We will start with an external voltage at present from Göran.

94
00:06:11.997 --> 00:06:14.687
Then we get into the panel discussion.

95
00:06:15.342 --> 00:06:19.902
We start at present and then we are moving towards possible initiatives and measures.

96
00:06:19.902 --> 00:06:22.382
Because that's where we want and what we want to talk about.

97
00:06:22.919 --> 00:06:25.851
Then we end the discussion with you who are watching

98
00:06:25.851 --> 00:06:29.410
Can ask a few questions to the panel via slido.com.

99
00:06:29.745 --> 00:06:35.235
The information about slido.com and the number will be available on different occasions

100
00:06:35.235 --> 00:06:37.340
In the box also under the program-

101
00:06:37.340 --> 00:06:39.724
So you don't have to worry about missing it.

102
00:06:40.811 --> 00:06:43.921
Finally we do a rounding where you, Göran

103
00:06:43.921 --> 00:06:47.541
Also do a summary of what you heard during the conversation.

104
00:06:48.429 --> 00:06:50.789
You are of course also included in the panel.

105
00:06:52.402 --> 00:06:54.502
Top, then I think we are running.

106
00:06:56.350 --> 00:07:01.295
Then we start with your world -running and analysis, Göran.
 You are welcome.

107
00:07:02.885 --> 00:07:03.835
Thanks, Fredrik.

108
00:07:05.404 --> 00:07:09.404
I will take some time here to begin with.

109
00:07:09.404 --> 00:07:15.704
I will try to be more quiet under the panel and compensate with it.

110
00:07:16.782 --> 00:07:22.350
A little neighbor my view of AI, the big things that happen

111
00:07:22.350 --> 00:07:25.905
in the world and Sweden in this context.

112
00:07:26.439 --> 00:07:32.809
The other day the annual report came from Stanford, including

113
00:07:33.799 --> 00:07:36.289
called AI Index Report.

114
00:07:37.358 --> 00:07:40.880
There is a lot of interest to look at

115
00:07:40.880 --> 00:07:44.238
in terms of comparisons in the world, different countries, and so on.

116
00:07:44.238 --> 00:07:50.448
One thing I thought stands out is that you find out nowadays

117
00:07:50.448 --> 00:07:55.678
that AI significantly increases productivity and quality.

118
00:07:55.678 --> 00:07:58.608
You have enough investigations that confirm it.

119
00:08:00.132 --> 00:08:03.842
This, of course, makes it from a business perspective

120
00:08:03.842 --> 00:08:07.212
So this is with AI extremely interesting.

121
00:08:07.212 --> 00:08:12.782
What you can look at the organizations in the world that have come the furthest with AI

122
00:08:12.782 --> 00:08:18.562
is that they have acquired any kind of platform knowledge-

123
00:08:19.170 --> 00:08:26.157
Which allows them to reuse what they have done with AI in many contexts.

124
00:08:26.157 --> 00:08:28.477
They do not have one, two or three applications

125
00:08:28.477 --> 00:08:34.427
Without significantly more, those who have come the longest.

126
00:08:36.817 --> 00:08:41.057
This has affected in the last at least ten years

127
00:08:41.347 --> 00:08:44.707
the competitive situation in different industries.

128
00:08:45.144 --> 00:08:51.794
It may be that you have competitors who have already gained well on their way with AI.

129
00:08:52.571 --> 00:08:56.331
Perhaps even more interesting is that many customers and suppliers

130
00:08:56.331 --> 00:08:57.646
Sit and thought about:

131
00:08:57.646 --> 00:09:01.851
"What parts of the processes could we crunch

132
00:09:01.851 --> 00:09:05.911
"And raise market shares on, on the basis that we use more AI?"

133
00:09:06.658 --> 00:09:13.408
You also have a certain relationship then with many of the startups that exist within AI.

134
00:09:13.408 --> 00:09:17.118
That is, that too ... [no sound]

135
00:09:28.268 --> 00:09:34.198
... which has its AIEKOSYSTEM and enters into new industries.

136
00:09:34.198 --> 00:09:37.348
When examined this in, for example, North America

137
00:09:37.642 --> 00:09:43.312
generally know ordinary companies that your own industry is-

138
00:09:43.312 --> 00:09:47.294
During strong opening, that it dissolves in different ways.

139
00:09:48.593 --> 00:09:55.583
You do not get the same results in Europe at all, so far, but sit a little more safe.

140
00:09:56.405 --> 00:10:00.295
But of course, the old truths also apply here.

141
00:10:00.583 --> 00:10:03.723
If it goes faster on the outside than the inside

142
00:10:03.723 --> 00:10:07.763
Could it be a rather difficult situation in the future with the development.

143
00:10:08.512 --> 00:10:13.042
Looking at those on the left, the big AI companies-

144
00:10:14.646 --> 00:10:18.156
and on the value, and compare the United States with Europe-

145
00:10:18.649 --> 00:10:23.739
So we have nothing at all in Europe similar to what is in the United States.

146
00:10:24.939 --> 00:10:29.034
These AI companies in the USA-

147
00:10:29.034 --> 00:10:35.449
has come across three trillion dollars in value.

148
00:10:36.239 --> 00:10:40.276
Europe's largest company is then more about

149
00:10:41.856 --> 00:10:44.724
Perfumes, handbags and slimming pills.

150
00:10:44.724 --> 00:10:48.744
There is quite a big difference in the focus, so they are smaller.

151
00:10:48.744 --> 00:10:54.444
One must also have in the background that Europe has a 30 % greater population than in the United States.

152
00:10:54.444 --> 00:10:58.684
So the gap is quite large, and between these two parts also exist

153
00:10:58.684 --> 00:11:05.684
Additional AI companies from the United States, in the form of Meta, Tesla and so on.

154
00:11:05.684 --> 00:11:10.724
Of course, several Chinese will be accommodated before the European companies.

155
00:11:11.338 --> 00:11:16.428
So that which moves the fastest forward in the world within AI

156
00:11:16.869 --> 00:11:18.769
and have done in the last few years-

157
00:11:18.769 --> 00:11:22.549
is North America, southeastern Asia and the United Kingdom.

158
00:11:23.780 --> 00:11:25.168
What do they have in common

159
00:11:25.168 --> 00:11:28.448
Not everyone has everything of this, but most people have the most.

160
00:11:28.448 --> 00:11:31.288
You have a strategic priority.

161
00:11:32.652 --> 00:11:39.252
You are located in Cabinet Office in London, in the White House, and so on.

162
00:11:39.763 --> 00:11:43.853
It is not as common in the EU, that you have that priority.

163
00:11:44.370 --> 00:11:48.580
Above all, there is a strong collaboration with the industry.

164
00:11:48.981 --> 00:11:54.251
When Martin and I were in the White House just a year ago

165
00:11:54.493 --> 00:11:57.623
We asked the question what they thought they were less good at.

166
00:11:57.623 --> 00:12:04.513
The first thing they mentioned was that you see that in the UK and Canada

167
00:12:05.703 --> 00:12:10.833
lets the export industry go ahead and try to take advantage of it-

168
00:12:11.101 --> 00:12:14.340
and in several ways find incentives to take advantage of it-

169
00:12:14.340 --> 00:12:17.700
into the public sector and to small businesses.

170
00:12:17.458 --> 00:12:21.828
Many of these countries work on democratizing AI in different ways.

171
00:12:22.560 --> 00:12:26.726
An exciting initiative in the US right now, I think, is to work with

172
00:12:26.726 --> 00:12:31.260
The whole population's creativity and see, how can we use this?

173
00:12:31.458 --> 00:12:36.278
Both in terms of entrepreneurship, but also to create culture and other things.

174
00:12:37.885 --> 00:12:43.768
I would say that several of the countries have a direct aggressive policy

175
00:12:43.768 --> 00:12:47.380
to attract the competence of various kinds.

176
00:12:47.929 --> 00:12:51.259
You are also involved in building different Aihubbar.

177
00:12:51.259 --> 00:12:56.799
That is, geographical location, around, for example, university campus

178
00:12:57.866 --> 00:13:01.910
where one has some of the large AI companies-

179
00:13:01.910 --> 00:13:06.139
a couple of universities and public sector-

180
00:13:06.139 --> 00:13:09.269
And startups in one place.

181
00:13:09.483 --> 00:13:12.303
Today one expects Canada has

182
00:13:12.303 --> 00:13:16.303
Twice as many AI hubs as you have in the EU.

183
00:13:17.502 --> 00:13:20.312
Canada with a population of 35 million.

184
00:13:21.181 --> 00:13:28.161
There are also plans to train leaders in a very explicit way.

185
00:13:30.104 --> 00:13:32.854
To just take an example of what this results in

186
00:13:32.854 --> 00:13:37.404
In, for example, health and health care, so is North America-

187
00:13:37.404 --> 00:13:42.930
Or Canada and the United States rather, with 5 % of the world's population ...

188
00:13:42.206 --> 00:13:46.760
Today, they account for 58 % of developments in health and healthcare.

189
00:13:46.370 --> 00:13:51.510
The fastest part is Southeast Asia and Australia.

190
00:13:53.354 --> 00:13:57.244
If we quickly skip to Sweden, in the limited time.

191
00:13:57.244 --> 00:13:58.644
How does it look there

192
00:13:58.856 --> 00:14:03.686
As I see it, we have some very strong benefits in Sweden

193
00:14:03.686 --> 00:14:05.960
In this in the future.

194
00:14:05.685 --> 00:14:08.345
We have a tradition of a strong entrepreneurship.

195
00:14:08.345 --> 00:14:12.415
We have internationally a very good leadership.

196
00:14:12.980 --> 00:14:16.800
We are good at transition, not just on the private side

197
00:14:16.800 --> 00:14:18.640
but also on the public.

198
00:14:19.148 --> 00:14:22.700
We have a good digitization in the basics

199
00:14:22.700 --> 00:14:25.578
that is necessary many times to do this.

200
00:14:25.578 --> 00:14:29.268
We have good quality data for a long time.

201
00:14:29.972 --> 00:14:33.155
I wasn't going to immerse so much in the forces

202
00:14:33.155 --> 00:14:35.585
But go a little more into weaknesses.

203
00:14:35.585 --> 00:14:39.585
I think it would be interesting if we could do something about them.

204
00:14:40.768 --> 00:14:44.298
There we have some problems, as I see it.

205
00:14:44.916 --> 00:14:47.796
We have a fairly problematic self -image many times.

206
00:14:47.796 --> 00:14:49.970
I meet many Swedish politicians

207
00:14:49.970 --> 00:14:56.210
And often it is stated that we are probably already the world's best on this with AI about.

208
00:14:57.600 --> 00:15:01.700
Leadership returns, both as a strength and disadvantage.

209
00:15:01.700 --> 00:15:05.572
We are far too quick to delegate this with AI.

210
00:15:07.110 --> 00:15:12.770
We have a problem in Swedish academy, as I see it, with strong division

211
00:15:13.218 --> 00:15:17.388
And for vocational preparation training, not broad enough.

212
00:15:17.388 --> 00:15:22.158
You go either towards stem training, science and technology-

213
00:15:22.158 --> 00:15:26.338
Or on the other hand, the humanities, behavioral science and others ...

214
00:15:27.649 --> 00:15:30.330
Like leadership recurs on both sides

215
00:15:30.330 --> 00:15:33.553
So I see it as digitalisation returning on both sides.

216
00:15:33.553 --> 00:15:38.583
That is, we want to push down AI as part of digitalisation.

217
00:15:39.531 --> 00:15:43.371
To comment on this with the leadership talk parts we have

218
00:15:43.371 --> 00:15:49.191
Do I see quite often in Sweden that we delegate Ai-

219
00:15:51.671 --> 00:15:56.591
To some one in the company management, which in turn starts different projects.

220
00:15:57.416 --> 00:16:01.126
I was recently at a relatively large Swedish authority

221
00:16:01.126 --> 00:16:06.766
that had worked for 2.5 years with Proof of Concept for an AI application-

222
00:16:06.766 --> 00:16:10.860
Which was not really important to them.

223
00:16:10.910 --> 00:16:14.390
Instead of doing like those who work more strategically

224
00:16:14.390 --> 00:16:16.840
that is, make sure that everyone in the lead-

225
00:16:16.840 --> 00:16:21.200
have sufficient knowledge of and understanding of what one does with ai-

226
00:16:21.200 --> 00:16:22.730
What you can and can't do.

227
00:16:22.730 --> 00:16:28.900
Not knowledge about technology and mathematics, but on consequences.

228
00:16:28.900 --> 00:16:31.600
It is really quite natural, if you think about it

229
00:16:31.600 --> 00:16:34.980
That this is where it belongs, because it is really just there-

230
00:16:34.980 --> 00:16:38.560
one has a holistic view and can prioritize-

231
00:16:38.560 --> 00:16:42.710
between all the tens of thousands of possible AI applications available.

232
00:16:43.207 --> 00:16:48.337
This is where you can work with the legal aspects and risk assessment.

233
00:16:48.800 --> 00:16:53.800
However, the companies or organizations often go to the right

234
00:16:54.534 --> 00:16:59.570
In a next step to train all staff, so to speak.

235
00:17:00.409 --> 00:17:02.189
A little bit about this with

236
00:17:05.789 --> 00:17:08.499
How we look at our self -image, and so on.

237
00:17:08.754 --> 00:17:12.904
Today Sweden ranks in the Global AI Index

238
00:17:12.904 --> 00:17:18.104
As most people consider to be the most serious ranking of countries-

239
00:17:18.345 --> 00:17:22.255
In 17th place by about 60 countries that have been ranked.

240
00:17:23.436 --> 00:17:30.316
What stands out negative is that there is a number 44 to the right.

241
00:17:30.316 --> 00:17:36.253
The headline for the one who is not visible here is how strategically you work with it

242
00:17:36.253 --> 00:17:40.630
From Government, so to speak.

243
00:17:41.465 --> 00:17:45.545
Then you can look at the first one here, that's the self -image then

244
00:17:45.545 --> 00:17:48.885
How a proposal came relatively recently to Parliament-

245
00:17:49.337 --> 00:17:55.147
that Sweden should regain this leading role in digitization and AI.

246
00:17:55.728 --> 00:17:57.868
Not only that we will regain a role

247
00:17:57.868 --> 00:18:00.318
I personally think we never had within Ai-

248
00:18:00.644 --> 00:18:04.434
So we should also show the world how AI can be used.

249
00:18:05.380 --> 00:18:10.718
As for our view of AI as part of digitization

250
00:18:11.657 --> 00:18:13.927
so comes this from the responsible minister-

251
00:18:13.927 --> 00:18:18.732
that it is very important that we do not do an AI strategy right now-

252
00:18:18.732 --> 00:18:21.322
but rather a digitization strategy.

253
00:18:22.679 --> 00:18:26.519
This is a relatively Swedish concern, I think.

254
00:18:26.739 --> 00:18:32.684
We miss the business and political opportunities with AI

255
00:18:32.684 --> 00:18:36.494
By pushing it down into something that maybe more often ...

256
00:18:36.494 --> 00:18:38.564
The improvements of the small steps then.

257
00:18:40.253 --> 00:18:44.463
But we have quite great opportunities, as I see it, or very large

258
00:18:44.463 --> 00:18:48.283
to do something about this kind of way.

259
00:18:48.428 --> 00:18:52.138
One is that things have been very fast in recent years in Sweden

260
00:18:52.138 --> 00:18:56.598
within our large export industry.

261
00:18:56.598 --> 00:19:01.158
As everyone knows, the small country has Sweden, at 10.5 million inhabitants

262
00:19:01.158 --> 00:19:05.488
An over -representation of large companies that work with exports.

263
00:19:06.656 --> 00:19:12.186
Here, most of these do not have any single-use applications-

264
00:19:12.186 --> 00:19:15.960
Without a strategic way of working with AI.

265
00:19:15.769 --> 00:19:19.199
There I think we need to find a way

266
00:19:19.199 --> 00:19:24.189
To do as the United States, Canada, UK and so on-

267
00:19:24.482 --> 00:19:29.372
To help small and medium -sized companies, help the public sector increase the pace.

268
00:19:30.280 --> 00:19:35.340
Another thing where we are well located, thanks in large part to Vinnova of course

269
00:19:37.680 --> 00:19:39.730
are our startup-

270
00:19:39.730 --> 00:19:45.360
where we per capita are almost as far ahead as the UK-

271
00:19:45.858 --> 00:19:50.780
And is in par with the best countries in general.

272
00:19:50.985 --> 00:19:54.845
Another possibility I've seen in recent weeks that one has taken

273
00:19:54.845 --> 00:19:58.395
Among other things, within the Swedish regions and municipalities I have worked with.

274
00:19:58.715 --> 00:20:05.350
That is to go in depth and look at the new aistrategia proposal-

275
00:20:05.350 --> 00:20:09.595
As AI Sweden has joined, which Martin will surely develop later.

276
00:20:10.670 --> 00:20:13.370
Then also an advantage ...

277
00:20:13.370 --> 00:20:16.240
If we now come late to the party

278
00:20:16.663 --> 00:20:21.668
Do we have the advantage that we can look at everything we have done in other countries.

279
00:20:21.668 --> 00:20:26.338
All experiences and things that have gone well and less well in other countries.

280
00:20:28.833 --> 00:20:31.533
We have a huge opportunity

281
00:20:31.533 --> 00:20:37.333
If we just start working a little tougher with this than we have done hit the hit

282
00:20:37.333 --> 00:20:41.453
And are not as reclined as we may have been in the last ten years.

283
00:20:42.293 --> 00:20:47.883
To draw a lot of things that our politicians usually tend to

284
00:20:47.883 --> 00:20:49.383
And we others too, I think.

285
00:20:50.328 --> 00:20:51.868
Where we can take advantage of AI.

286
00:20:51.868 --> 00:20:55.908
We can look around only in the Nordic countries and find a lot of good stuff.

287
00:20:56.861 --> 00:21:01.701
But to do this, of course, we need competitive companies

288
00:21:01.701 --> 00:21:04.241
that today has begun to take advantage of Ai-

289
00:21:04.241 --> 00:21:08.501
But maybe even small and medium -sized would have to do it a little more.

290
00:21:09.787 --> 00:21:13.767
So Fredrik, I hope I didn't pull out too much on time.

291
00:21:14.070 --> 00:21:15.296
I leave over to you.

292
00:21:15.421 --> 00:21:17.961
No, we are well located.

293
00:21:17.961 --> 00:21:20.461
Big thanks, Göran, for your valuable analysis.

294
00:21:21.183 --> 00:21:24.353
We have actually been able to get a question from the audience.

295
00:21:24.569 --> 00:21:27.549
We have about 400 viewers right now, so it's fun.

296
00:21:29.224 --> 00:21:30.844
Thomas Deming asks:

297
00:21:31.204 --> 00:21:34.444
How do we avoid trying to compete with the outside world

298
00:21:34.753 --> 00:21:37.153
In the same areas they are investing in?

299
00:21:37.477 --> 00:21:38.807
And number two:

300
00:21:38.807 --> 00:21:41.477
How can we take new creative paths

301
00:21:41.477 --> 00:21:44.907
Where we can use unique Swedish qualities?

302
00:21:44.907 --> 00:21:46.951
It is about strength areas, and so on.

303
00:21:46.951 --> 00:21:49.791
Do you have any spontaneous response to it

304
00:21:52.850 --> 00:21:57.885
The question, as I see it, is that we want to compete in terms of our companies.

305
00:21:57.885 --> 00:21:59.865
We want to be good and compete there.

306
00:21:59.865 --> 00:22:06.250
What I suspect the issue is about is the benefits of welfare for example.

307
00:22:06.695 --> 00:22:10.695
I think we learn way too little today.

308
00:22:10.695 --> 00:22:13.265
Speaking of this self -image I'm talking about

309
00:22:13.265 --> 00:22:16.155
is there a picture that we should learn internally in Sweden-

310
00:22:16.155 --> 00:22:19.795
And then we will bring it out in the world, which I showed on this exercise.

311
00:22:19.795 --> 00:22:21.385
It's pretty common.

312
00:22:21.385 --> 00:22:24.305
I think you could turn this around.

313
00:22:26.100 --> 00:22:29.641
Those who are ahead, so to speak, we learn from.

314
00:22:30.385 --> 00:22:36.792
The word world best and world leader has returned in budget proposals

315
00:22:36.792 --> 00:22:40.212
in terms of digitalisation and AI for many years.

316
00:22:40.689 --> 00:22:43.669
I don't see it negative that you do something good

317
00:22:44.117 --> 00:22:48.498
for the elderly care in Copenhagen, or childcare in Oslo.

318
00:22:48.698 --> 00:22:52.808
It is rather just to go there and learn and take advantage of it.

319
00:22:53.694 --> 00:22:55.974
More international collaborations, I believe.

320
00:22:55.974 --> 00:22:59.694
Some who were very early and good at this were Region Halland

321
00:22:59.694 --> 00:23:01.126
As many feel to-

322
00:23:01.126 --> 00:23:07.260
Who learned almost ten years ago from the best in the world what to do.

323
00:23:08.654 --> 00:23:09.804
More of it, I think.

324
00:23:10.462 --> 00:23:12.592
I forgot the second question, sorry.

325
00:23:13.773 --> 00:23:16.433
Yes, but we may be able to return to the latter.

326
00:23:16.433 --> 00:23:19.213
As for Swedish areas of strength and how we should think there

327
00:23:19.213 --> 00:23:21.943
From a perhaps technical perspective.

328
00:23:22.856 --> 00:23:23.616
Good.

329
00:23:24.375 --> 00:23:29.565
Before we start with the panel discussion I will briefly show a slide

330
00:23:29.565 --> 00:23:32.145
on what Vinnova's investment in AI looked out over the years.

331
00:23:32.808 --> 00:23:35.108
If you can show it slide.
 Good.

332
00:23:36.484 --> 00:23:39.614
These bars show the size of the financing decisions

333
00:23:39.614 --> 00:23:41.864
We have taken for AI projects every year.

334
00:23:42.809 --> 00:23:48.829
For example in the last four years we have decided on average

335
00:23:48.829 --> 00:23:52.899
About SEK 700 million per year on AI-related projects.

336
00:23:53.955 --> 00:23:59.350
Göran, do you make any reflection when you see this

337
00:23:59.689 --> 00:24:01.429
Timing, or something else

338
00:24:04.595 --> 00:24:07.815
From my perspective, I think it looks good with timing.

339
00:24:07.815 --> 00:24:11.185
I think Vinnova was relatively early.

340
00:24:12.250 --> 00:24:16.750
We see a lot of results from this, which are interesting.

341
00:24:17.204 --> 00:24:23.440
I do not assess this type of public funding

342
00:24:23.440 --> 00:24:30.440
Or the one that Wasp stands for, the private, as one of Sweden's concerns.

343
00:24:30.440 --> 00:24:33.274
On the contrary, it is rather strength areas then.

344
00:24:33.818 --> 00:24:39.172
Without what I tried to go through earlier, weaknesses were other than this.

345
00:24:41.258 --> 00:24:43.148
I think this is very important

346
00:24:43.148 --> 00:24:46.278
If it can continue in this way and be built up.

347
00:24:47.449 --> 00:24:49.169
Swedish entrepreneurship.

348
00:24:49.169 --> 00:24:50.990
Okay, yes.

349
00:24:52.117 --> 00:24:54.237
We can take it back for a while.

350
00:24:55.556 --> 00:24:59.976
Briefly described, before we move on, it is so that our support of AI

351
00:24:59.976 --> 00:25:05.460
Started with the fact that AI projects were more organically picked up in our broad calls.

352
00:25:05.674 --> 00:25:08.924
About 2017, AI became more and more in focus.

353
00:25:09.434 --> 00:25:12.674
This led to larger specific investments and calls.

354
00:25:13.283 --> 00:25:15.833
In 2018 we contributed, among other things

355
00:25:15.833 --> 00:25:19.283
To start AI Sweden, which Martin represents.

356
00:25:20.314 --> 00:25:24.554
Especially from 2020, we have significantly switched our investments.

357
00:25:25.470 --> 00:25:27.357
We are now working with AI on many fronts.

358
00:25:28.112 --> 00:25:32.982
We run the Innovation Program Advanced Digitization ”

359
00:25:32.982 --> 00:25:36.932
Together with Teknikföretagen and several large Swedish industrial companies.

360
00:25:37.706 --> 00:25:38.986
We have an aiprogram-

361
00:25:38.986 --> 00:25:42.626
A power collection for AI in municipalities and civil society.

362
00:25:42.914 --> 00:25:45.304
We work internationally, and so on.

363
00:25:45.635 --> 00:25:48.875
Of course, it is interesting to understand what is behind the numbers.

364
00:25:48.875 --> 00:25:52.305
To make a long story short, we work both short and long term.

365
00:25:52.305 --> 00:25:56.665
We work with lace, excellence and lace technology.

366
00:25:57.419 --> 00:25:59.309
We work with broad ability.

367
00:25:59.309 --> 00:26:04.325
Partly basic data issues and partly advanced implementation projects.

368
00:26:06.654 --> 00:26:10.294
It is briefly what Vinnova's investment has looked like.

369
00:26:12.603 --> 00:26:16.150
Then we go ahead and enter the panel discussion.

370
00:26:17.820 --> 00:26:21.820
The first part is Swedish current situation, strengths and weaknesses.

371
00:26:24.725 --> 00:26:25.825
The question then becomes ...

372
00:26:26.143 --> 00:26:29.273
If we continue on the theme presented by Göran.

373
00:26:29.456 --> 00:26:31.106
Where does Sweden stand today

374
00:26:31.453 --> 00:26:35.213
What do we have for strengths and weaknesses, according to you

375
00:26:35.293 --> 00:26:37.933
What do you say in the panel about this

376
00:26:38.307 --> 00:26:40.165
I'll start with you, Sara.

377
00:26:41.720 --> 00:26:42.670
Two questions then.

378
00:26:42.670 --> 00:26:45.410
Partly, do you want to add something to Göran's presentation

379
00:26:45.704 --> 00:26:48.135
Then from your perspective, how do you look at this

380
00:26:49.440 --> 00:26:51.600
Yes thank you.

381
00:26:52.474 --> 00:26:55.477
I was going to start with, where is Sweden now within AI

382
00:26:55.477 --> 00:27:00.470
Göran showed this Global AI Index from Tortoise Media

383
00:27:00.333 --> 00:27:01.833
Where we are in place 17.

384
00:27:01.833 --> 00:27:06.293
What we can also see is that there are areas where we are stronger and weaker.

385
00:27:06.683 --> 00:27:10.783
In the case of, for example, research and access to competence

386
00:27:10.900 --> 00:27:13.900
we lie slightly better than 17.

387
00:27:13.380 --> 00:27:15.900
As for what they call operating Environment

388
00:27:15.900 --> 00:27:18.870
we are in place 2, which should be a strength.

389
00:27:18.870 --> 00:27:21.840
It is about Sweden and the Swedish Society's

390
00:27:21.840 --> 00:27:23.700
Ability to absorb new technology.

391
00:27:24.370 --> 00:27:28.397
At Government Strategy we are in place 44

392
00:27:28.397 --> 00:27:30.797
As Göran pointed out, it's not that flattering.

393
00:27:31.559 --> 00:27:34.619
On infrastructure we are in place 21.

394
00:27:35.261 --> 00:27:41.310
I would like to say that we had not had that position today

395
00:27:41.310 --> 00:27:45.181
If it had not been so that we had been so early to invest.

396
00:27:45.181 --> 00:27:48.321
We started the Wise program as early as 2015.

397
00:27:49.300 --> 00:27:52.426
It is Sweden's largest individual research initiative through the ages

398
00:27:52.426 --> 00:27:55.756
with a budget of 6.3 billion-

399
00:27:56.070 --> 00:27:59.355
for basic research within AI, autonomous systems and software.

400
00:28:00.382 --> 00:28:03.472
With the aim of conducting excellent research

401
00:28:03.472 --> 00:28:07.360
and skills build -up within AI, autonomous systems and software

402
00:28:07.360 --> 00:28:10.562
for the benefit of Swedish industry, but also Swedish society.

403
00:28:11.205 --> 00:28:15.450
What we do in the program is partly that we recruit researchers.

404
00:28:15.450 --> 00:28:18.695
We will recruit over 80 new researchers to Sweden

405
00:28:18.695 --> 00:28:20.566
that will establish new research groups.

406
00:28:20.830 --> 00:28:24.811
Today we have 60 of them in place, so we are good on the track.

407
00:28:24.811 --> 00:28:28.931
The program runs until 2032, so it is very long -term.

408
00:28:30.040 --> 00:28:33.283
We have a very large research school, where we educate doctors.

409
00:28:33.549 --> 00:28:37.549
The target is at least 600 graduated doctors.

410
00:28:37.774 --> 00:28:42.664
Today we have about 110120 that have already graduated.

411
00:28:43.240 --> 00:28:45.644
A new doctor will be produced a week.

412
00:28:46.700 --> 00:28:48.807
We have 440 in the research school.

413
00:28:49.275 --> 00:28:51.845
What is extra fun is when we look at

414
00:28:51.845 --> 00:28:55.150
What happened to those who have a PhD from Wasp research school.

415
00:28:55.392 --> 00:28:58.522
Two -thirds of them actually work in Swedish companies.

416
00:28:59.299 --> 00:29:01.479
A little less than a third in the Swedish Academy.

417
00:29:01.479 --> 00:29:08.490
A handful of seven, of the first hundred have left Sweden.

418
00:29:08.245 --> 00:29:09.785
It is very gratifying.

419
00:29:10.106 --> 00:29:11.980
So it gives results.

420
00:29:11.980 --> 00:29:15.500
We see that the research we fund is very highly ranked.

421
00:29:15.382 --> 00:29:19.202
It has been published over 1,550 articles

422
00:29:19.202 --> 00:29:22.882
which has a significantly higher quotation rate than we normally have in Sweden.

423
00:29:23.598 --> 00:29:25.838
It gives the result that we build competence.

424
00:29:26.273 --> 00:29:28.403
But all this is basic research.

425
00:29:28.739 --> 00:29:32.129
It is as Göran points out that it may not be there ...

426
00:29:32.129 --> 00:29:34.540
There we have bet a lot, and it gives rash

427
00:29:34.540 --> 00:29:38.300
But there are other areas where we are not as strong at all.

428
00:29:39.173 --> 00:29:43.473
We lack investments around how we apply AI.

429
00:29:43.473 --> 00:29:46.423
We have AI Sweden, but we would have to do much more.

430
00:29:46.635 --> 00:29:48.937
Specifically also against the public sector

431
00:29:48.937 --> 00:29:51.407
And as Göran mentioned, small and medium -sized companies.

432
00:29:51.721 --> 00:29:55.101
All of these are areas where we would have to do much more.

433
00:29:57.664 --> 00:30:00.534
Thank you so much for that review, Sara.

434
00:30:01.602 --> 00:30:03.702
Then we move on to you, Johan.

435
00:30:04.845 --> 00:30:06.955
How do you look at the Swedish current situation

436
00:30:06.955 --> 00:30:10.325
Maybe from the perspective of Swedish industry and Swedish tech company.

437
00:30:12.924 --> 00:30:15.974
I can really agree with the picture from Göran and Sara.

438
00:30:15.974 --> 00:30:20.334
What I see is a very double and divided image.

439
00:30:20.494 --> 00:30:24.170
It happens both lots at a few

440
00:30:24.170 --> 00:30:28.534
But very little with a long tail company.

441
00:30:28.768 --> 00:30:32.508
Of course, we have worked primarily with research -intensive companies

442
00:30:32.508 --> 00:30:36.180
As at the top, 1-2 % are companies.

443
00:30:36.180 --> 00:30:40.108
Technology company, financial industry, pharmaceuticals, perhaps energy companies

444
00:30:40.315 --> 00:30:44.295
Which has in many ways been forced to apply AI.

445
00:30:44.507 --> 00:30:47.770
Without AI, they do not have a chance in the world market.

446
00:30:47.704 --> 00:30:50.441
So it has really been a necessity for them.

447
00:30:51.157 --> 00:30:55.767
There we see more and more that more people see the light, that they have to start investing.

448
00:30:55.767 --> 00:30:57.787
Export -oriented companies see that:

449
00:30:58.137 --> 00:31:01.320
"If we do not invest in this, we will not be part of the match at all".

450
00:31:01.320 --> 00:31:03.570
They see that they have to race and on.

451
00:31:03.730 --> 00:31:06.360
But it is difficult, because just as Göran is in on

452
00:31:06.457 --> 00:31:09.467
So you miss a lot of this fashion.

453
00:31:09.979 --> 00:31:14.909
You get stuck in the fact that you should very clearly count on investments in advance.

454
00:31:14.909 --> 00:31:17.479
You are not used to experimenting and Pilota.

455
00:31:17.660 --> 00:31:19.820
But AI is not like regular software.

456
00:31:19.992 --> 00:31:23.665
You can't always count home and know what the AI solution will give you-

457
00:31:23.665 --> 00:31:28.250
Before you start experimenting and see what value is in the data.

458
00:31:28.383 --> 00:31:31.373
Then there is a great deal that gets stuck in a position of wait and see

459
00:31:31.373 --> 00:31:34.473
that are a bit scared of the fact that it goes so fast within Ai-

460
00:31:34.473 --> 00:31:38.473
So maybe we should wait a few years and see if the dust has settled then.

461
00:31:38.711 --> 00:31:42.271
But the risk is, of course, that then competitors have run further

462
00:31:42.402 --> 00:31:47.820
And you yourself get stuck there and have a long way to race.

463
00:31:47.260 --> 00:31:48.880
But it is obvious, I think

464
00:31:48.880 --> 00:31:53.700
that Sweden has good conditions today to apply a lot of AI.

465
00:31:53.959 --> 00:31:58.790
Thanks to WASP, among other things, we have strong research and expertise.

466
00:31:58.374 --> 00:32:01.294
More and more talented engineers are examined, etc.

467
00:32:01.513 --> 00:32:05.263
The competence is there, so now it is about application.

468
00:32:07.101 --> 00:32:08.401
Great.
 Thanks, Johan.

469
00:32:08.975 --> 00:32:10.875
Then we move on to you, Evelina.

470
00:32:10.875 --> 00:32:14.635
How do you look at the Swedish current forces, weaknesses, and so on.

471
00:32:14.917 --> 00:32:19.467
If you want from an e-commerce and service sector perspective perhaps

472
00:32:19.467 --> 00:32:24.327
As I think Wellstreet is active to invest in as a VC company.

473
00:32:25.178 --> 00:32:30.811
Yes exactly.
 I thought that fashion is absolutely at startups.

474
00:32:30.967 --> 00:32:36.427
That is why I believe in a closer cooperation with industry.

475
00:32:37.352 --> 00:32:41.412
We invest in all types of tech companies, sectors and verticals.

476
00:32:41.412 --> 00:32:47.212
It is an incredibly exciting time to be an early investor.

477
00:32:48.726 --> 00:32:53.770
I would say it's not a better time right now ...

478
00:32:53.770 --> 00:32:57.157
There is no better time than right now to jump on the Aitåget.

479
00:32:57.157 --> 00:32:59.447
We notice that in the startup scene.

480
00:33:00.134 --> 00:33:03.724
It pops up Aibolag that mushrooms out there.

481
00:33:03.829 --> 00:33:05.789
It is a large AIHAJP that is going on.

482
00:33:05.789 --> 00:33:09.730
That shark is very related to Genai.

483
00:33:09.730 --> 00:33:13.269
I think it's a bit of a shame that there is so much focus on Genai

484
00:33:13.269 --> 00:33:15.989
When there is much else to focus on.

485
00:33:15.989 --> 00:33:18.309
Not least when it comes to industry.

486
00:33:18.309 --> 00:33:23.119
So I hope that will get some more attention later.

487
00:33:23.119 --> 00:33:26.609
But if you look at what is happening within generative AI now

488
00:33:26.609 --> 00:33:29.881
So from an investor's perspective, it is interesting to look at ...

489
00:33:30.412 --> 00:33:31.442
What to say...

490
00:33:31.442 --> 00:33:34.902
The kind of tech stack that is starting to be built up-

491
00:33:35.104 --> 00:33:40.194
Where you can categorize the different types of AI companies.

492
00:33:40.194 --> 00:33:42.914
I do Aibolag [handgest], because I think that in day-

493
00:33:42.914 --> 00:33:45.534
are all companies tech companies, and as soon as ...

494
00:33:46.544 --> 00:33:50.908
Before we know so much more, everyone will surely be aibolag.

495
00:33:51.292 --> 00:33:55.532
But if you look at the tech stack, we try to understand:

496
00:33:55.532 --> 00:34:00.472
Is this a hardware provider, which is at the bottom?

497
00:34:00.472 --> 00:34:05.220
Or is it in cloud, enabler or model provider

498
00:34:05.220 --> 00:34:10.232
Or a company at the top of the pyramid, which is an Application Provider

499
00:34:10.232 --> 00:34:16.370
That really uses models to solve problems that customers have.

500
00:34:16.997 --> 00:34:20.997
There is, as I said, a lot of courage right now in the startup scene.

501
00:34:22.427 --> 00:34:26.980
The important thing is to consider as a founder::

502
00:34:26.980 --> 00:34:29.940
What is it really for problems we solve

503
00:34:30.151 --> 00:34:34.231
To build successful companies is about solving a problem.

504
00:34:34.231 --> 00:34:39.521
Preferably a big problem that many have, where AI can be part of it.

505
00:34:40.342 --> 00:34:42.772
What I was going to say further is that

506
00:34:43.320 --> 00:34:49.812
Since the cost of intelligence is now almost down to zero-

507
00:34:49.812 --> 00:34:55.842
AI is not really a differentiator, which makes you have a USP.

508
00:34:56.310 --> 00:35:00.111
Many companies now need to think about how to defend themselves.

509
00:35:00.291 --> 00:35:04.750
We talk in the VC world about Moats, moat.

510
00:35:04.750 --> 00:35:09.540
That is, what is it that makes you succeed in the competition

511
00:35:09.540 --> 00:35:12.620
There it is interesting to look at, it is to appropriation data

512
00:35:12.620 --> 00:35:16.600
Is it the customer base or is it something else?

513
00:35:17.187 --> 00:35:19.917
There I think the big companies have a lot to win

514
00:35:19.917 --> 00:35:24.107
Because you already have a lot of resources, processes and capital in place.

515
00:35:24.206 --> 00:35:27.256
So I just believe in this closer collaboration

516
00:35:27.256 --> 00:35:30.526
With brave startups and industries with a lot of potential.

517
00:35:32.965 --> 00:35:34.735
How interesting.
 Thanks so much.

518
00:35:35.760 --> 00:35:39.290
Time goes very fast when you have this interesting discussion.

519
00:35:39.621 --> 00:35:46.131
We move on to part two, which we have certainly come into already.

520
00:35:46.398 --> 00:35:49.578
Our needs, opportunities and priorities ahead.

521
00:35:49.993 --> 00:35:51.673
What are we need to grab then

522
00:35:52.665 --> 00:35:55.955
We are a little into it too, so I think the word is free.

523
00:35:55.955 --> 00:36:00.285
Who wants to capture that question first, and perhaps comment on something said

524
00:36:01.875 --> 00:36:04.845
You can raise your hand.
 -I can hook in quickly.

525
00:36:08.305 --> 00:36:13.155
Just briefly back to the last question, I totally agree with the speakers here.

526
00:36:14.120 --> 00:36:19.120
A great strength is that we have the tip.
 Thanks to all the work you have done, Sara.

527
00:36:19.424 --> 00:36:22.454
It is fun to hear that so many stay in Sweden.

528
00:36:22.454 --> 00:36:24.734
It's a fantastic figure, I would say.

529
00:36:25.609 --> 00:36:29.929
As you say, Johan, we have the companies that have actually come a long way.

530
00:36:30.625 --> 00:36:34.500
And what you were in, Evelina, about the big companies.

531
00:36:34.500 --> 00:36:38.335
There we have companies that sit on a huge amount of proprietary data

532
00:36:38.335 --> 00:36:40.325
Without really getting started.

533
00:36:40.464 --> 00:36:44.274
I think that is a really great opportunity for Sweden

534
00:36:44.274 --> 00:36:46.974
Given the diversified industry we have.

535
00:36:48.739 --> 00:36:54.779
I would say that it is very much about going from lace to width

536
00:36:55.190 --> 00:36:57.520
Where we start making this much wider.

537
00:36:58.538 --> 00:37:02.318
I think, just like Göran, is that the leadership here is an absolute key.

538
00:37:03.449 --> 00:37:09.639
That we get it up in more organizations, and of course preferably from government.

539
00:37:10.635 --> 00:37:11.415
Thanks, Martin.

540
00:37:11.415 --> 00:37:16.305
You have many members, also many from the public sector.

541
00:37:16.514 --> 00:37:18.351
Do you have something you want to share

542
00:37:18.351 --> 00:37:21.801
Just what the situation is there and what the opportunity looks like?

543
00:37:22.419 --> 00:37:26.390
It has happened super very much, but simplified you can say

544
00:37:26.390 --> 00:37:30.392
That AI Sweden's members also reflect what Johan says.

545
00:37:30.804 --> 00:37:35.124
It is above all those who have started early and who go ahead.

546
00:37:35.488 --> 00:37:40.518
Although we may think that we have many members, 130 now, it is ..

547
00:37:40.518 --> 00:37:44.568
For example, we have only less than 1 % of all Swedish companies

548
00:37:44.568 --> 00:37:48.878
With more than 250 employees, it is an extremely small part yet.

549
00:37:49.625 --> 00:37:55.655
It indicates that we need to get involved much more in this issue

550
00:37:56.360 --> 00:38:00.136
and as has been said, invest in application and use it-

551
00:38:00.136 --> 00:38:04.536
In a way that makes it spread across sectors and across the country.

552
00:38:06.230 --> 00:38:07.200
Okay.

553
00:38:07.440 --> 00:38:10.710
May I fill up a bit?
 -Yes, I was just going to give the word to you.

554
00:38:10.710 --> 00:38:14.270
I totally agree with Martin, but what I would like to see ...

555
00:38:14.270 --> 00:38:19.680
We have talked about that we are starting to gain skills available and good research.

556
00:38:19.680 --> 00:38:21.960
We are starting to get better at education.

557
00:38:22.080 --> 00:38:25.242
But I still think that when looking at the use of AI

558
00:38:25.242 --> 00:38:31.212
That it is very much so that it is in the form of test systems and demos.

559
00:38:31.212 --> 00:38:35.382
I think we have to get started and start using AI really in production.

560
00:38:35.382 --> 00:38:39.822
In products, services in the real systems

561
00:38:39.822 --> 00:38:42.532
in the companies and the public sector.

562
00:38:42.854 --> 00:38:45.534
There I think it goes too slowly.

563
00:38:45.534 --> 00:38:50.114
We need to increase the pace and get better cooperation.

564
00:38:50.114 --> 00:38:54.524
We need to help our above all small and medium -sized companies

565
00:38:54.524 --> 00:38:56.804
To get started and use AI for real.

566
00:38:57.293 --> 00:38:58.903
Thanks.
 Evelina, you wanted to come in.

567
00:38:59.789 --> 00:39:01.590
Yes exactly.

568
00:39:01.590 --> 00:39:04.369
As Sara is in, I think it is very important.

569
00:39:04.369 --> 00:39:10.409
Just like startups are striving to find Product Market Fit

570
00:39:10.409 --> 00:39:14.989
This is how it is AI initiative to also find an AI problem fit.

571
00:39:15.355 --> 00:39:19.215
For all problems, aite technology does not require.

572
00:39:19.215 --> 00:39:22.185
I think it's very important to get these successes

573
00:39:22.185 --> 00:39:26.535
Which makes you dare to invest even more in the long term.

574
00:39:27.510 --> 00:39:30.530
The other thing I was thinking about was jacketing into what Martin said.

575
00:39:30.530 --> 00:39:32.720
I think leadership is A and O.

576
00:39:32.720 --> 00:39:38.110
It must be at the board level, which we previously heard from Göran.

577
00:39:38.110 --> 00:39:39.690
Because these are strategic issues.

578
00:39:39.690 --> 00:39:42.330
These are both short and long -term issues.

579
00:39:42.677 --> 00:39:44.537
It is board issues, simply.

580
00:39:44.537 --> 00:39:46.857
Something I think and wish ...

581
00:39:46.857 --> 00:39:50.737
I do not know if it is the Aic Commission that will come up with that type of encouragement.

582
00:39:50.737 --> 00:39:54.797
I would like all stock exchange boards, or all major boards

583
00:39:54.797 --> 00:39:58.277
Has an AI expert on the board.

584
00:39:58.277 --> 00:40:01.267
I think we in Sweden also have

585
00:40:01.457 --> 00:40:06.097
Very many talented people who have been engaged for a long time with Ai-

586
00:40:06.709 --> 00:40:11.364
which may not necessarily have a classic board background-

587
00:40:11.528 --> 00:40:16.328
But that can add an incredible amount in this respect.

588
00:40:16.328 --> 00:40:19.818
Then I think we could really take some steps forward

589
00:40:19.965 --> 00:40:22.595
If you have that understanding up here.

590
00:40:23.800 --> 00:40:30.270
Thanks.
 If we move into the last part, that is, the way forward.

591
00:40:30.962 --> 00:40:34.442
What measures and bets, in addition to those you have already lifted

592
00:40:34.552 --> 00:40:38.812
In different parts of society, you see that Sweden needs to take hold in-

593
00:40:38.812 --> 00:40:40.312
And where there are opportunities?

594
00:40:41.166 --> 00:40:42.376
Johan, how do you look at it

595
00:40:44.933 --> 00:40:46.343
I think it's...

596
00:40:46.343 --> 00:40:49.582
As many of us are in, gratifying that we have such consensus.

597
00:40:49.582 --> 00:40:53.562
It is precisely that the conditions are starting to be good at research and skills.

598
00:40:53.916 --> 00:40:55.667
There are skills shortages.

599
00:40:55.667 --> 00:40:59.777
There I would emphasize that the greatest lack of skills I see

600
00:40:59.777 --> 00:41:03.207
is not about specific skills to build AI models-

601
00:41:03.207 --> 00:41:04.737
without deploying them.

602
00:41:04.927 --> 00:41:07.677
Perform a production in a robust, reliable way.

603
00:41:08.136 --> 00:41:10.956
We have many people with us, but we need many more.

604
00:41:10.956 --> 00:41:12.456
They are hard to find.

605
00:41:12.872 --> 00:41:17.462
In general, I think it would be good to point out a direction for Sweden.

606
00:41:17.462 --> 00:41:21.802
There I would call for the government, that the government could play a role.

607
00:41:22.190 --> 00:41:25.330
Look at France, Canada and others, who have ...

608
00:41:25.330 --> 00:41:28.410
You don't have all the answers here and now, you point out a direction.

609
00:41:28.410 --> 00:41:30.230
"We want this way".

610
00:41:30.459 --> 00:41:31.869
Set up an ambitious goal.

611
00:41:31.869 --> 00:41:34.869
What could Sweden do around, for example, use?

612
00:41:34.869 --> 00:41:39.529
How many who not only use AI

613
00:41:39.529 --> 00:41:42.449
Without also moving on and participates in developing AI solutions.

614
00:41:42.920 --> 00:41:46.810
Something that I see clearly is that you will not be able to be competitive

615
00:41:46.810 --> 00:41:51.060
only by purchasing some AI apps and AI solutions that you use-

616
00:41:51.225 --> 00:41:53.555
For example, to write software code faster.

617
00:41:53.555 --> 00:41:54.685
Everyone will do it.

618
00:41:55.026 --> 00:41:58.586
You can be competitive and get lasting benefits if you look at:

619
00:41:58.586 --> 00:42:02.066
"What kind of unique data and unique processes" do we have "

620
00:42:02.302 --> 00:42:07.852
"How can we build unique world -leading solutions in that particular niche"

621
00:42:08.475 --> 00:42:11.545
So not only use, but also participate and develop.

622
00:42:11.720 --> 00:42:14.510
Dramatize to develop disables.

623
00:42:14.510 --> 00:42:17.220
There is a lot that can be done.

624
00:42:17.220 --> 00:42:21.080
Above all, it is possible to pilot and test on a small scale.

625
00:42:21.248 --> 00:42:25.878
Everyone should test that Pilota's resolutions for their unique problem.

626
00:42:26.722 --> 00:42:29.862
I still think the innovation system, and even politics

627
00:42:30.111 --> 00:42:32.161
Talking too much about conditions.

628
00:42:32.161 --> 00:42:33.661
Now we have them in place.

629
00:42:33.661 --> 00:42:37.101
Now it is about looking forward to application and use.

630
00:42:38.382 --> 00:42:39.352
Thanks, Johan.

631
00:42:40.142 --> 00:42:44.842
Martin, you recently launched an Aistrategia for Sweden.

632
00:42:45.119 --> 00:42:46.219
Why did you do that

633
00:42:47.796 --> 00:42:50.306
It connects very well into this call.

634
00:42:50.306 --> 00:42:56.786
We did this to be able to push properly on many more leaders out there.

635
00:42:57.403 --> 00:43:00.903
Those who have already been on for many years and come a long way

636
00:43:00.903 --> 00:43:03.183
we don't have to be so worried about.

637
00:43:03.183 --> 00:43:07.309
But the incredible amount

638
00:43:07.309 --> 00:43:10.459
Both public and private organizations we have in Sweden ...

639
00:43:10.459 --> 00:43:13.579
We have a very decentralized public sector, for example

640
00:43:13.579 --> 00:43:19.574
Which has not yet started, but began to feel that there is something here.

641
00:43:20.328 --> 00:43:25.298
Then we wanted to give them a guide really, a way of thinking

642
00:43:26.404 --> 00:43:29.674
And a huge call to actually get started with these parts.

643
00:43:29.674 --> 00:43:33.674
Then we believe that even this strategy is applicable as

644
00:43:34.853 --> 00:43:40.603
input even to decision makers in the public-

645
00:43:41.675 --> 00:43:46.585
For how to allocate means and catalyze, you can say-

646
00:43:47.346 --> 00:43:49.336
A faster progress here.

647
00:43:49.569 --> 00:43:53.419
If we look at the public sector, it makes up almost half of our GDP.

648
00:43:54.243 --> 00:43:56.815
A leadership from government with incentive

649
00:43:56.815 --> 00:44:01.595
to develop this in collaboration and share solutions between each other-

650
00:44:01.595 --> 00:44:04.725
Would be a very successful Swedish model.

651
00:44:06.410 --> 00:44:07.280
Thanks.

652
00:44:07.610 --> 00:44:10.330
Göran, it was a little while since you came in.

653
00:44:10.437 --> 00:44:12.757
What would you like to add about our way forward

654
00:44:16.013 --> 00:44:20.551
As for companies, to begin with, I want to supplement what Evelina said.

655
00:44:20.551 --> 00:44:26.351
I see a certain interest in what Evelina mentioned

656
00:44:26.351 --> 00:44:31.584
About having someone on the board who is good at AI.

657
00:44:32.997 --> 00:44:38.587
Unfortunately in Sweden, sometimes someone comes ...

658
00:44:38.587 --> 00:44:41.577
Yes, what should we say professor of technology about.

659
00:44:41.577 --> 00:44:43.977
Someone who comes from a fairly technical point of view.

660
00:44:44.552 --> 00:44:50.082
When I educate boards in other countries you have more interest in all

661
00:44:50.857 --> 00:44:54.687
not all minus one, but all on the board and corporate management-

662
00:44:54.883 --> 00:44:57.703
Have a rudimentary knowledge of what it is about.

663
00:45:00.225 --> 00:45:02.335
I believe, if possible

664
00:45:02.988 --> 00:45:07.368
That Sweden would have to be even more offensive there too.

665
00:45:08.047 --> 00:45:12.287
As for politics, as Martin came into

666
00:45:13.180 --> 00:45:16.310
So I think it's a bit similar.

667
00:45:17.002 --> 00:45:23.772
One is quick to delegate to any single person who specializes

668
00:45:23.772 --> 00:45:27.532
And delegates to official management, and so on.

669
00:45:28.674 --> 00:45:32.874
I don't think it will work so well for Swedish either.

670
00:45:32.874 --> 00:45:36.359
I see how to get away, and have been doing for several years

671
00:45:36.359 --> 00:45:40.099
on summer training, congressmen and senators-

672
00:45:40.099 --> 00:45:42.059
to MIT and Stanford in the United States.

673
00:45:42.059 --> 00:45:46.279
While we in Sweden have a single day in the Riksdag from time to time

674
00:45:46.875 --> 00:45:50.875
Where some come and tell them quite generally about what AI is for something.

675
00:45:52.092 --> 00:45:55.202
You sit a little too much on the stand, as I see it.

676
00:45:55.202 --> 00:46:00.202
Thanks, Göran.
 Then we find that we need more leadership

677
00:46:00.202 --> 00:46:04.152
More interest from leadership and a higher level of ambition.

678
00:46:05.481 --> 00:46:08.121
Sara, you are welcome to add what was said here.

679
00:46:08.121 --> 00:46:12.581
Before you do, I have any questions that you can pick up if you want.

680
00:46:15.459 --> 00:46:18.449
For starters, the development is not directly still.

681
00:46:18.881 --> 00:46:22.881
There are things beyond large -scale language models and chatgpt, and so on.

682
00:46:24.677 --> 00:46:28.407
What do we need to keep track of there in our investment

683
00:46:28.816 --> 00:46:34.756
My second question is that AI affects the conditions for research in itself

684
00:46:34.756 --> 00:46:36.466
Thus, general research.

685
00:46:37.192 --> 00:46:41.524
We see how to develop new proteins in furious speed

686
00:46:41.524 --> 00:46:44.134
Thanks to AI models and so on.

687
00:46:44.397 --> 00:46:47.567
Is that something you want to catch up in what I said, Sara

688
00:46:48.416 --> 00:46:49.246
Absolutely.

689
00:46:49.246 --> 00:46:52.656
I start with one thing we need, which may sound a bit boring.

690
00:46:52.656 --> 00:46:56.216
But we actually need infrastructure in Sweden as well.

691
00:46:56.216 --> 00:46:59.036
We have funded infrastructure for research

692
00:46:59.036 --> 00:47:01.176
with the Berzelius computer.

693
00:47:01.371 --> 00:47:06.611
But there is no such for companies, authorities, the public sector to use.

694
00:47:06.611 --> 00:47:09.081
So we also need to invest in infrastructure.

695
00:47:09.492 --> 00:47:12.182
Then if I start with your last question ...

696
00:47:12.701 --> 00:47:15.050
An area I find exciting

697
00:47:15.050 --> 00:47:20.471
Is the role AI plays in pushing research forward.

698
00:47:20.471 --> 00:47:22.749
Now I'm not talking about aiforship-

699
00:47:22.749 --> 00:47:29.549
Without AI as enabler for science, life science and new materials.

700
00:47:29.549 --> 00:47:34.636
There we see that protein wrap is such a thing you started with quite early.

701
00:47:34.636 --> 00:47:36.546
Now you start moving on to the next step.

702
00:47:36.546 --> 00:47:40.925
How can we use AI to actually understand what makes cells get sick

703
00:47:40.925 --> 00:47:43.305
So that we can cure these diseases?

704
00:47:43.679 --> 00:47:47.989
How can we use AI to develop new materials and molecules

705
00:47:47.989 --> 00:47:52.349
Who can help us cope with the challenges we have with sustainability?

706
00:47:54.127 --> 00:48:00.837
My conviction is that if we are to cope with the very challenging goals we have

707
00:48:00.837 --> 00:48:05.487
both in terms of sustainability and health and sustainable development-

708
00:48:05.487 --> 00:48:07.557
Then we must use AI in research.

709
00:48:07.557 --> 00:48:13.467
So it will be incredibly exciting to see how AI will work

710
00:48:13.467 --> 00:48:16.367
in the service of research and as an aid to the researchers.

711
00:48:16.759 --> 00:48:17.489
Thanks.

712
00:48:17.489 --> 00:48:20.469
Then it is a matter of aiformity standing still.

713
00:48:20.469 --> 00:48:22.829
No absolutely not.
 It moves lightning fast forward.

714
00:48:23.119 --> 00:48:26.659
It's just trying to invest forward as well.

715
00:48:26.659 --> 00:48:28.289
There is no other option.

716
00:48:29.718 --> 00:48:30.568
Thanks, Sara.

717
00:48:30.817 --> 00:48:33.099
Evelina, do you have something you want to add

718
00:48:33.099 --> 00:48:37.539
We also have a regulation from Europe, AI Act and so on.

719
00:48:37.711 --> 00:48:41.861
Do you have any reflections on it how can we take it as an opportunity?

720
00:48:41.861 --> 00:48:44.301
What is important for the way forward

721
00:48:44.478 --> 00:48:48.197
I think first and foremost that it is important with the visionary leadership

722
00:48:48.197 --> 00:48:50.990
Like everyone here in the panel is in.

723
00:48:50.990 --> 00:48:53.110
I think it's important at all levels.

724
00:48:53.586 --> 00:48:58.246
Not least the discussions that have come up about how it will affect jobs ahead.

725
00:48:59.028 --> 00:49:03.498
Where we notice some concern in the market, and early tendencies to it already

726
00:49:03.498 --> 00:49:07.068
With a strike that went on in Hollywood not so long ago.

727
00:49:07.407 --> 00:49:10.077
There I think you will have to work much more.

728
00:49:10.077 --> 00:49:16.067
And show the opportunities for this, that a new type of job will emerge.

729
00:49:16.067 --> 00:49:20.297
Another type of re and upscaling will be required in society at large.

730
00:49:21.395 --> 00:49:25.545
Then I also think about this with the fact that visionary leadership is about ...

731
00:49:25.545 --> 00:49:32.195
Now many people understand more what AI is about, thanks to chatgpt.

732
00:49:32.195 --> 00:49:39.195
It is important for education in society, which in the end is a matter of democracy.

733
00:49:40.264 --> 00:49:45.294
If we are to be able to do these things forward, it is important that everyone is allowed to keep up.

734
00:49:45.294 --> 00:49:48.258
Right now we have a world where ai-development-

735
00:49:48.258 --> 00:49:52.318
Actually, five companies happen at a certain place in the world.

736
00:49:53.177 --> 00:49:54.377
I think about it partly.

737
00:49:54.845 --> 00:49:59.552
Even when we talk the issue of democracy, we know that half

738
00:49:59.772 --> 00:50:04.242
The population is missing from this revolution.

739
00:50:04.354 --> 00:50:06.834
Most research reports ...

740
00:50:07.310 --> 00:50:13.200
Companies that are started have not had women to the extent that it should be.

741
00:50:13.200 --> 00:50:13.920
No.

742
00:50:14.632 --> 00:50:19.452
The other thing I think based on the visionary leadership is to

743
00:50:19.452 --> 00:50:22.752
This is a social issue, and it is about resilience.

744
00:50:22.752 --> 00:50:26.112
I think you should remember that AI development is very important-

745
00:50:26.112 --> 00:50:30.772
In understanding that we are all part of the total defense even forward.

746
00:50:30.772 --> 00:50:36.362
It is not only the climate issue, but also the geopolitical challenges we face.

747
00:50:36.969 --> 00:50:43.169
I think that all boards, regardless of level, should put AI on the agenda.

748
00:50:43.169 --> 00:50:45.959
You should have a plan for it.
 That plan is likely to

749
00:50:45.959 --> 00:50:50.089
Do not look as you think in the beginning, it will need to be revised.

750
00:50:50.272 --> 00:50:54.822
But to think about Aiadoption within the company.

751
00:50:55.589 --> 00:50:59.329
If you have to do that, you shouldn't?
 Why?
 Advantages and disadvantages?

752
00:50:59.329 --> 00:51:04.809
As part of it, AI Act will be something we will all live with.

753
00:51:05.005 --> 00:51:11.365
The important thing there is to try to use it as a guidance in getting started with AI

754
00:51:11.365 --> 00:51:14.815
Rather than seeing it as being a stop for AI.

755
00:51:14.815 --> 00:51:17.375
For something that is really positive about the regulation

756
00:51:17.375 --> 00:51:20.555
is that we get a clear guidance-

757
00:51:20.555 --> 00:51:23.505
in how to develop and use AI in a sustainable way.

758
00:51:23.505 --> 00:51:27.095
I think we will see that kind of regulations forward in other places.

759
00:51:27.700 --> 00:51:29.440
Thanks so much.

760
00:51:30.379 --> 00:51:34.299
Time, as I said, goes very fast.
 You should get the word, Johan.

761
00:51:34.939 --> 00:51:37.819
We simply start with our last words.

762
00:51:38.114 --> 00:51:42.844
Then I will take one at a time, so you are happy to get 3040 seconds to sum up-

763
00:51:42.844 --> 00:51:47.324
What you think is most important for the audience to get Sweden's way forward.

764
00:51:48.427 --> 00:51:54.263
As a short recording to it, Johan, it is so that we find out

765
00:51:54.263 --> 00:51:57.283
That we are entering what you might call an AI revolution.

766
00:51:57.598 --> 00:51:59.398
We are right at the beginning

767
00:51:59.398 --> 00:52:02.288
And sees what great power the large -scale models have.

768
00:52:02.574 --> 00:52:06.574
Then they have barely begun to implement them into the entire community.

769
00:52:07.101 --> 00:52:10.961
So we all understand that it will be a pretty big transformation.

770
00:52:10.961 --> 00:52:14.551
Then we have the next wave of innovation after that.

771
00:52:14.551 --> 00:52:16.851
When it comes now, but maybe not so far away.

772
00:52:18.158 --> 00:52:22.178
It may also be that we as a nation will have to think really big

773
00:52:22.527 --> 00:52:25.947
About what we will be for country in the future in this revolution.

774
00:52:26.237 --> 00:52:29.867
So what can we succeed with and what do you want to send with as last words?

775
00:52:30.100 --> 00:52:35.060
It will be my final summary there.
 Johan, well.

776
00:52:37.548 --> 00:52:42.718
I would like to emphasize that the Ai -Revolution is available to everyone.

777
00:52:43.265 --> 00:52:47.045
Very much tools are open sourcade and can be pilota.

778
00:52:47.200 --> 00:52:49.040
More and more skills are trained.

779
00:52:49.040 --> 00:52:52.270
You can borrow an ex -worker from a university.

780
00:52:52.270 --> 00:52:54.330
You can have access to start doing this.

781
00:52:54.330 --> 00:52:57.510
This is not just for Amazon, Microsoft and Openai.

782
00:52:57.510 --> 00:53:01.240
This is for all possible companies in Sweden that can use this.

783
00:53:01.450 --> 00:53:05.180
So take advantage of that opportunity, because it is an opportunity for you

784
00:53:05.180 --> 00:53:08.475
To secure your business, future-proof Swedish job-

785
00:53:08.475 --> 00:53:10.310
by developing and renewing them.

786
00:53:10.614 --> 00:53:13.454
The opportunity is here and now.
 Don't wait for it.

787
00:53:13.454 --> 00:53:17.124
Don't wait for an app to solve it, but start working on this.

788
00:53:17.124 --> 00:53:21.204
If anyone from the government listens, I suggest that you can look at ...

789
00:53:21.433 --> 00:53:23.673
Maybe you can screw on the research deduction.

790
00:53:23.673 --> 00:53:25.113
It can be a concrete way.

791
00:53:25.113 --> 00:53:28.763
Can be enabled for research deductions even for AI development-

792
00:53:28.763 --> 00:53:31.607
A little easier than goes now, in companies?

793
00:53:31.607 --> 00:53:35.757
So not only research -heavy companies, but also medium -sized, can use it.

794
00:53:35.757 --> 00:53:38.157
Maybe you can also be inspired by the robot lift

795
00:53:38.157 --> 00:53:42.157
which brought together small and medium -sized manufacturing companies with robot experts.

796
00:53:42.390 --> 00:53:44.090
To be inspired by the road forward.

797
00:53:44.227 --> 00:53:45.537
Good.
 Thanks, Johan.

798
00:53:46.037 --> 00:53:50.557
I need to ask for a shorter response from you others.

799
00:53:51.377 --> 00:53:52.867
We move on with you, Evelina.

800
00:53:52.867 --> 00:53:55.783
What are your last words to send by for the road forward

801
00:53:57.843 --> 00:54:01.068
I think it's just the right time to jump on.

802
00:54:01.068 --> 00:54:02.458
It's definitely not too late.

803
00:54:02.458 --> 00:54:05.878
Many people compare this revolution with the Internet.

804
00:54:05.878 --> 00:54:11.048
So it's much like saying in 1996 that you are late in the Internet Revolution.

805
00:54:11.048 --> 00:54:13.468
Time is now, it's just as good to jump on.

806
00:54:14.166 --> 00:54:16.076
Thanks.
 Martin

807
00:54:17.415 --> 00:54:20.126
I just fill up.
 Let's start and take the first step.

808
00:54:20.126 --> 00:54:24.206
It is very clear that those who understand this best also invest the most.

809
00:54:24.206 --> 00:54:28.526
If we get started, we will create value and take it from there, simply.

810
00:54:30.405 --> 00:54:35.665
Thanks.
 Last but not least, Sara, because Göran will make a summation.

811
00:54:36.222 --> 00:54:38.902
Yes.
 Our purpose as a foundation is to be rural.

812
00:54:38.902 --> 00:54:41.852
I think AI is a technology that we have to use

813
00:54:41.852 --> 00:54:44.802
To ensure that Sweden is successful in the long term.

814
00:54:44.802 --> 00:54:46.602
It is both about Swedish companies.

815
00:54:46.602 --> 00:54:50.192
It will be a necessity to use AI if one is to be successful.

816
00:54:50.192 --> 00:54:53.832
It is not just about efficiency, but also completely new opportunities.

817
00:54:53.832 --> 00:54:57.562
And also in the public sector, where we see that care is kneeling.

818
00:54:57.562 --> 00:55:00.819
You can't do what is needed with the resources you have.

819
00:55:00.819 --> 00:55:03.029
You have to use new tools, and that is AI.

820
00:55:03.029 --> 00:55:05.739
Just jump on and step on as soon as possible.

821
00:55:05.739 --> 00:55:07.139
And it's not too late.

822
00:55:08.287 --> 00:55:09.117
Thanks.

823
00:55:10.643 --> 00:55:15.273
Good, then we get into audience issues and at least have a question.

824
00:55:15.569 --> 00:55:17.459
It is aimed at all of you.

825
00:55:18.678 --> 00:55:24.268
Sweden's Unicorns has often been applicants and marketers

826
00:55:24.746 --> 00:55:25.806
rather than deep tech.

827
00:55:26.406 --> 00:55:29.276
Is it likely that it will also be Sweden's role in AI

828
00:55:30.028 --> 00:55:32.988
Should we invest more in models and basic techniques

829
00:55:33.808 --> 00:55:37.308
Or product and application to benefit from the development?

830
00:55:38.010 --> 00:55:39.250
Someone who wants to comment

831
00:55:42.973 --> 00:55:43.893
Johan

832
00:55:44.636 --> 00:55:46.126
I can take a first attempt.

833
00:55:46.126 --> 00:55:48.436
We actually build great language models.

834
00:55:48.436 --> 00:55:53.836
On Finnish supercomputers with Finnish state funding and eufinance-

835
00:55:53.836 --> 00:55:56.756
So we are building world -leading Swedish -speaking models now.

836
00:55:57.006 --> 00:55:58.006
It is difficult.

837
00:55:58.296 --> 00:56:01.986
It requires tremendously deep pockets to lead within Deep Tech.

838
00:56:01.986 --> 00:56:05.006
It will probably be difficult for Sweden to do so.

839
00:56:05.006 --> 00:56:07.346
This does not mean that we should not try to understand.

840
00:56:09.738 --> 00:56:12.268
Thanks.
 Someone else with a very short comment

841
00:56:12.940 --> 00:56:18.350
Good and interesting question.
 I think we don't know the answer.

842
00:56:18.976 --> 00:56:23.096
I think it's important to be humble in ongoing revolution

843
00:56:23.096 --> 00:56:25.899
in the form of not knowing what happens in six months.

844
00:56:25.899 --> 00:56:30.079
The important thing that Johan is in is rather back to the issue of democracy.

845
00:56:30.079 --> 00:56:33.579
If we have large language models that we are very dependent on

846
00:56:33.681 --> 00:56:35.471
So it is problematic.

847
00:56:36.711 --> 00:56:38.281
Sara, did you want to add something

848
00:56:38.538 --> 00:56:43.498
I was just going to say that historically Sweden has been good at deep tech company.

849
00:56:43.498 --> 00:56:45.958
I would not want to exclude that opportunity at all.

850
00:56:45.958 --> 00:56:48.308
I think we should do both parts.

851
00:56:48.657 --> 00:56:51.457
Okay.
 Big thanks for your summaries.

852
00:56:51.838 --> 00:56:55.668
We can easily last for another hour, it feels like, and maybe more.

853
00:56:57.323 --> 00:56:59.693
Then I turn to you, Göran.

854
00:57:01.337 --> 00:57:07.337
Would you be able to in a few minutes max sum up the most important things you heard today

855
00:57:08.137 --> 00:57:10.087
And how you look on the road forward?

856
00:57:12.038 --> 00:57:17.018
I thought there were many very important views that came out.

857
00:57:17.018 --> 00:57:24.028
I think it is easy for us to underestimate how important Wasp is.

858
00:57:24.028 --> 00:57:29.668
You need a broader understanding of it in society overall.

859
00:57:29.668 --> 00:57:35.704
I think it would be good if the public could meet up and match a little

860
00:57:35.704 --> 00:57:40.594
The investments that Sara describes from the WASP hold.

861
00:57:42.779 --> 00:57:45.809
Johan had very good views

862
00:57:45.809 --> 00:57:51.919
Around that a lot is happening at a few right now in Sweden-

863
00:57:52.440 --> 00:57:58.580
While he described a long tail by many where not much happens.

864
00:57:58.580 --> 00:58:02.290
I think that is very much about incentives.

865
00:58:04.014 --> 00:58:08.334
The export industry has no choice, they must do this.

866
00:58:08.475 --> 00:58:13.575
What I see happens more in Sweden now is that municipalities and regions lie

867
00:58:13.575 --> 00:58:20.575
quite long before the Swedish authorities because of this particular with att-

868
00:58:20.575 --> 00:58:26.523
75 % will do 125 % jobs ahead in municipalities and regions.

869
00:58:26.523 --> 00:58:31.303
That is, they have no choice either, but must use AI.

870
00:58:32.275 --> 00:58:34.905
Evelina mentioned something important

871
00:58:34.905 --> 00:58:39.025
Namely, there is much other than generative AI.

872
00:58:39.025 --> 00:58:43.695
Generative AI is somehow the top of the iceberg, the visible.

873
00:58:44.148 --> 00:58:47.568
It is a fantastic thing and will add a lot to Sweden

874
00:58:47.568 --> 00:58:49.658
But there is much else too.

875
00:58:50.229 --> 00:58:56.089
Something I stuck to as Evelina mentioned was AI's importance to the total defense.

876
00:58:56.995 --> 00:58:59.085
Martin was in on the fact that

877
00:58:59.983 --> 00:59:05.423
We have to go from the tip we have to a width.

878
00:59:05.423 --> 00:59:10.273
We must explicitly invest in use in different ways.

879
00:59:10.571 --> 00:59:15.071
Possibly my own summary is that we have somehow ...

880
00:59:16.470 --> 00:59:19.550
What would the military say clear sign from Colonel.

881
00:59:19.550 --> 00:59:23.880
We have a clear sign from research, from use within Sweden

882
00:59:23.880 --> 00:59:27.500
Especially outside Sweden, lots of experiences to take off.

883
00:59:27.954 --> 00:59:34.284
It ends up very much on Swedish leaders, to act now.

884
00:59:34.961 --> 00:59:39.681
On my part, this is no criticism of poor leaders who have a lot to do.

885
00:59:40.265 --> 00:59:45.525
But one needs to prioritize this issue quite strongly, I think

886
00:59:45.608 --> 00:59:47.428
From a leadership perspective.

887
00:59:47.807 --> 00:59:48.707
Good.
 Thanks, Göran.

888
00:59:48.913 --> 00:59:52.393
We're pulling over a minute.
 It goes well, I hope.

889
00:59:53.477 --> 00:59:58.105
Big thanks for all your input in this very important discussion.

890
00:59:58.546 --> 01:00:03.666
We can note that much of Sweden wants to see a completely different level of ambition

891
01:00:04.027 --> 01:00:06.647
Around how we invest and take care of AI.

892
01:00:07.223 --> 01:00:13.823
Vinnova is fully included in that ambition and look forward to that in every way we can

893
01:00:13.823 --> 01:00:16.563
assist in this power collection to invest ahead.

894
01:00:16.563 --> 01:00:19.223
We believe it is incredibly important.

895
01:00:20.251 --> 01:00:22.251
It may be my short summation.

896
01:00:23.138 --> 01:00:27.228
We look forward to a Sweden that decided to invest even more in AI.

897
01:00:27.915 --> 01:00:32.145
Big thanks to the panel and to you who listened

898
01:00:32.145 --> 01:00:35.215
And all the questions that have come in that we have not been able to answer.

899
01:00:35.411 --> 01:00:36.421
We take them with us.

900
01:00:37.419 --> 01:00:39.859
Have a good weekend, what it suffers.
 See you.
