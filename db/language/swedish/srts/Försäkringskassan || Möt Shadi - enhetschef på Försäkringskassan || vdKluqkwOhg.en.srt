1
00:00:03,719 --> 00:00:08,719
I applied early to the Social Insurance Office with a dream to join in and take responsibility

2
00:00:08,719 --> 00:00:13,199
in an authority that accounts for such a large part of society's security system.

3
00:00:16,039 --> 00:00:21,199
My name is Shadi and I have now worked here for over 20 years and today I am unit manager.

4
00:00:22,360 --> 00:00:27,000
As a manager, I have to dare to make decisions and be creative in my solutions,

5
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,960
Then it is about inspiring and creating commitment.

6
00:00:31,159 --> 00:00:34,199
I also have the ultimate responsibility for reaching goals and results,

7
00:00:34,199 --> 00:00:38,480
At the same time as I will work for a health promotion and good work environment,

8
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:43,760
So that my employees feel good and get the right conditions for performing their assignments.

9
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:48,440
My reward is to see people grow and develop,

10
00:00:48,440 --> 00:00:51,760
And know that I can be involved and influence.

11
00:00:52,400 --> 00:00:57,800
Since then, no day is the same, I continue to develop in my role as manager.

12
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:03,880
I think it is both inspiring and motivating to work at Försäkringskassan,

13
00:01:03,880 --> 00:01:09,320
And every day I feel that I am involved in performing a socially important assignment,

14
00:01:09,320 --> 00:01:12,159
Like securing the livelihood of children and families.

15
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:15,840
And that makes me proud.
