1
00:00:03.400 --> 00:00:07.080
What do you want today to say to your children -

2
00:00:07.240 --> 00:00:12.360
- As has grown up within Jehovah's Witnesses, because you were a witness?

3
00:00:12.520 --> 00:00:18.800
My love is neither less nor more than when I was a Jehovah's Witness.

4
00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:21.960
My mother's love is the same.

5
00:00:22.120 --> 00:00:27.600
I hope they have a good life, but I also apologize.

6
00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:30.760
In which community did your children grow up?

7
00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:34.800
In Pentecostal church.
 I thought it felt good.

8
00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:39.160
It was fun that she wanted to get involved.
 It felt like...

9
00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:44.320
... A good place, a safe environment with loving people.

10
00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:51.880
When your daughter today talks about what it was like for her, what do you think?

11
00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:59.600
I get really sad and very angry, how it can go like this.

12
00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:17.360
This is the story of all the children who have taken harm-

13
00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:24.000
- Of the religion their parents chose them.
 And they are everywhere.

14
00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:31.920
They grew up in different religious contexts, and they are many.

15
00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:37.360
All children who grow up in religious home do not get bad.

16
00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:43.400
But now it is about those who have done it.
 Now let's listen to them.

17
00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:08.240
Do you miss your family and your parents?

18
00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:15.560
I don't miss them.
 I don't miss my family.

19
00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:20.840
I don't miss how I was with them.

20
00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:26.240
I feel much better now than when I lived with them.

21
00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:36.920
But I feel sympathy for my mother, even though she was my perpetrator.

22
00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:43.840
Although she was the one who had the role of the one who controlled me the most.

23
00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:50.720
Although she has caused me most pain in life -

24
00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:53.800
- So I feel sympathy for her.

25
00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:59.960
And sometimes I can fantasize about a day when we somehow -

26
00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:05.480
- Get contact again, where she left my dad ...

27
00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:11.280
... and where she can forgive me because I left her -

28
00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:14.720
- And I can forgive her for what she did.

29
00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:20.520
And where we can go ahead and have a nice mom-daughter relationship.

30
00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:28.640
Many of the stories are about the fear of losing their parents -

31
00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:32.360
- If you go against the religion they have chosen.

32
00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:37.520
With those who were forced to break with their parents, there is grief.

33
00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:42.760
Jonnah, who was excluded from Jehovah's Witnesses three years ago -

34
00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:46.520
–Ach who was then forced to break with his family -

35
00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:51.800
- Will never stop hoping that they will want to meet again.

36
00:03:51.960 --> 00:03:58.520
She is thinking about how they should be affected by her telling us what happened.

37
00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:05.440
That is why it became so hard to do this too.

38
00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:11.120
I think if Dad would see, against presumption -

39
00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:15.280
- So I don't know about ... For me, this is important to talk about -

40
00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:20.160
- And that people should hear and understand what it means.

41
00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:26.240
If Dad looks ... either then maybe it opens a door that is on the glare -

42
00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:30.920
- Or it closes the door forever.

43
00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:36.280
At the same time, I can't go and wait for my whole life that may happen.

44
00:04:36.440 --> 00:04:43.000
- What is you dreaming about going to happen?
 - That they want to talk to me.

45
00:04:43.160 --> 00:04:46.040
Well, that's it.

46
00:04:46.200 --> 00:04:51.400
I don't ask much, but just to ...

47
00:04:51.560 --> 00:04:55.680
... you can be seen every now and then or talk about ...

48
00:04:55.840 --> 00:05:00.440
... talk about the weather, type.
 Whatever.

49
00:05:00.600 --> 00:05:06.680
Talk about how things are going to school or at work or so.

50
00:05:06.840 --> 00:05:10.320
Everyday things.

51
00:05:10.480 --> 00:05:13.600
It is.

52
00:05:17.760 --> 00:05:25.200
If one, as a young man, was forced to leave the religious contexts of his parents -

53
00:05:25.360 --> 00:05:32.000
- For you want to live in a different way, or fall in love with someone ...

54
00:05:32.160 --> 00:05:38.280
What do you want to say to someone who has been to cut with their parents?

55
00:05:38.440 --> 00:05:43.440
To begin with, it is right to cut with the parents.

56
00:05:43.600 --> 00:05:50.040
Otherwise, one will seriously limit your freedom ahead in time.

57
00:05:50.200 --> 00:05:55.200
Then maybe you will have to do it later.
 It is very important-

58
00:05:55.360 --> 00:06:00.800
- To show to their parents that as an adult you have the right to make decisions -

59
00:06:00.960 --> 00:06:05.960
- Run who you stay with, marry, etc.

60
00:06:06.120 --> 00:06:11.760
The cutting of relationships is always very painful.

61
00:06:11.920 --> 00:06:15.640
You live in a fog sometimes, in confusion -

62
00:06:15.800 --> 00:06:20.840
- When an attachment relationship needs to be broken.

63
00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:25.000
For a period, it may be important to set up.

64
00:06:25.160 --> 00:06:30.160
One will long to return and experience confusion around it -

65
00:06:30.320 --> 00:06:35.160
“But it is probably important to continue on a set -up course.

66
00:06:35.320 --> 00:06:41.440
At the same time, it may be good not to diabolize their parents -

67
00:06:41.600 --> 00:06:45.600
- For they are also caught in a context.

68
00:06:45.760 --> 00:06:48.960
They may have grown up with it.

69
00:06:49.120 --> 00:06:54.800
That you do not give up the possibility that it may someday -

70
00:06:54.960 --> 00:06:59.840
- Can be found to find each other back.

71
00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:04.880
Maybe not as close or so, but that you can still have some contact.

72
00:07:05.040 --> 00:07:07.800
I think that is good -

73
00:07:07.960 --> 00:07:13.800
- For the person's mental feeling and development anyway.

74
00:07:13.960 --> 00:07:17.320
You make a decision and stick to it.

75
00:07:17.480 --> 00:07:20.480
One should not diabolize the parents -

76
00:07:20.640 --> 00:07:26.200
- Uteran see them as people who were also influenced by their environment.

77
00:07:28.720 --> 00:07:33.080
How can you as a parent expose your child to that?

78
00:07:33.240 --> 00:07:39.000
How can you choose the congregation and God before their own child?

79
00:07:39.160 --> 00:07:43.240
I get in touch with a woman who wants to try to explain.

80
00:07:43.400 --> 00:07:48.240
When she had children, it was a matter of course to raise them -

81
00:07:48.400 --> 00:07:51.960
- In accordance with the doctrine of Jehovah's Witnesses.

82
00:07:52.120 --> 00:07:58.320
Today, when she has left the movement, she thinks differently.

83
00:07:58.480 --> 00:08:02.160
They grow up in a doctrine that is two -part.

84
00:08:02.320 --> 00:08:05.320
There are some positive things -

85
00:08:05.480 --> 00:08:09.560
- And things that can be scary for children, adult stuff.

86
00:08:09.720 --> 00:08:13.920
The positive things are that you believe in a higher power -

87
00:08:14.080 --> 00:08:17.080
- On a God who is loving.

88
00:08:17.240 --> 00:08:22.760
And this god, Jehovah, will create a paradise on earth -

89
00:08:22.920 --> 00:08:26.680
- Where everyone should live in peace and harmony.

90
00:08:26.840 --> 00:08:31.400
The back is something that the children also learn:

91
00:08:31.560 --> 00:08:37.720
In paradise, only those worship Jehovah are allowed to join.

92
00:08:37.880 --> 00:08:42.600
And to be involved, one must behave in a certain way:

93
00:08:42.760 --> 00:08:46.800
You should be a baptized Jehovah's Witness and Jehovah's Friend.

94
00:08:46.960 --> 00:08:53.600
You learn about Harmageddon, the war that reveals all evil and evil people.

95
00:08:53.760 --> 00:08:57.240
It is a two -part doctrine.

96
00:08:57.400 --> 00:09:03.480
It is fine, but at a fairly high price, that you teach the children.

97
00:09:03.640 --> 00:09:09.640
What do you think about it was the worldview your children grew up with?

98
00:09:09.800 --> 00:09:13.520
After all, I'm a little ashamed of it.

99
00:09:13.680 --> 00:09:20.280
It is an extremely simplified worldview to give children.
 You teach the children -

100
00:09:20.440 --> 00:09:25.600
- That we have friends in the congregation, and then they are worldly outside.

101
00:09:25.760 --> 00:09:30.800
It is a worldview where you learn that the truth is in the congregation.

102
00:09:30.960 --> 00:09:35.960
This means that the truth outside, what others believe in, is a lie.

103
00:09:36.120 --> 00:09:42.640
What in the doctrine scared you as a child?
 You grew up within Jehovah's Witnesses.

104
00:09:42.800 --> 00:09:47.680
One thing I remember was my mother who was not a Jehovah's Witness.

105
00:09:47.840 --> 00:09:51.960
I was terrified that she would not come to paradise.

106
00:09:52.120 --> 00:09:56.240
I understood early on that Mom did not believe in this -

107
00:09:56.400 --> 00:09:59.400
- So paradise would be without her.

108
00:09:59.560 --> 00:10:04.240
And it would not be a paradise without my mother.
 I said many times:

109
00:10:04.400 --> 00:10:09.640
"You have to become a Jehovah's Witness! I don't want to live in paradise without you."

110
00:10:09.800 --> 00:10:14.360
It is probably the biggest horror I had as a child -

111
00:10:14.520 --> 00:10:18.680
- That mom would die and not be allowed to join.

112
00:10:18.840 --> 00:10:25.000
When you had children yourself, did you think that they could feel the same fear?

113
00:10:25.160 --> 00:10:30.440
No, it's strange.
 After all, we were united in the congregation.

114
00:10:30.600 --> 00:10:35.200
We had the whole family in the congregation.
 It has not struck me.

115
00:10:35.360 --> 00:10:42.600
However, I and the children's father have never been Armagedon parents.

116
00:10:42.760 --> 00:10:48.760
We browsed past the tough stuff in the book with biblical stories.

117
00:10:48.920 --> 00:10:54.000
Because I already thought it was not good for the kids.

118
00:10:54.160 --> 00:11:00.800
But it doesn't matter, because they hear about it, they read and they see pictures.

119
00:11:00.960 --> 00:11:06.120
And it has crept afterwards, from my youngest daughter special -

120
00:11:06.280 --> 00:11:11.280
- What a scared she was and what she was ashamed when she did something wrong.

121
00:11:11.440 --> 00:11:15.920
For Jehovah, everything sees.
 What we who parents thought were nice -

122
00:11:16.080 --> 00:11:20.520
- That you always have a God who supports you, be scary for her.

123
00:11:20.680 --> 00:11:23.680
It means that God sees everything.

124
00:11:23.840 --> 00:11:28.640
She told me yesterday about anything ... I had no idea.

125
00:11:28.800 --> 00:11:33.080
When she went to the low school she had a best girlfriend -

126
00:11:33.240 --> 00:11:37.760
- And that friend was kissed on her mouth.

127
00:11:37.920 --> 00:11:43.200
At the same time, she knew how Jehovah's Witnesses view homosexuality.

128
00:11:43.360 --> 00:11:49.400
She had a stomach ache and was so scared and sorry for doing wrong.

129
00:11:49.560 --> 00:11:54.560
She would not come to paradise, because Jehovah was disappointed with her.

130
00:11:54.720 --> 00:12:01.360
How does it feel today to think that it affected your children so much?

131
00:12:01.520 --> 00:12:04.200
I am ashamed.

132
00:12:05.360 --> 00:12:08.720
It's awful that I exposed them to it.

133
00:12:08.880 --> 00:12:12.600
And so cheated you get.

134
00:12:12.760 --> 00:12:18.440
I love my kids and would never do anything to scare them.

135
00:12:19.560 --> 00:12:24.560
And yet I made my daughter constant stomach pain -

136
00:12:24.720 --> 00:12:28.720
- For things she didn't dare tell me.

137
00:12:34.240 --> 00:12:37.600
It's not just the children in Jehovah's Witnesses -

138
00:12:37.760 --> 00:12:44.120
- Which tells about horror images that their parents' religion has given them.

139
00:12:44.280 --> 00:12:48.920
What scared me as a child was hell.

140
00:12:49.080 --> 00:12:54.920
That people are locked up in a psychotic darkness ...

141
00:12:56.480 --> 00:13:01.960
... and screams with anxiety.
 That was the picture I had of hell.

142
00:13:02.120 --> 00:13:04.520
Not to get to heaven -

143
00:13:04.680 --> 00:13:09.040
- Not to spend eternity with my parents and my family.

144
00:13:09.200 --> 00:13:14.240
I was afraid that my friends who were not Christians would not be there.

145
00:13:14.400 --> 00:13:17.400
The demons told me:

146
00:13:17.560 --> 00:13:23.240
"You think you can hide from us, but we know you don't believe."

147
00:13:23.400 --> 00:13:25.680
"We can get into you."

148
00:13:25.840 --> 00:13:31.360
About everything that happens if you end up in hell.

149
00:13:31.520 --> 00:13:35.320
About the warm fire.
 About the devil who whips one.

150
00:13:35.480 --> 00:13:38.240
About being forced to drink blood.

151
00:13:38.400 --> 00:13:43.280
That I would not be allowed to get into heaven.
 That I would die.

152
00:13:43.440 --> 00:13:48.960
That I would stand outside the pearl gate and wait forever.

153
00:13:49.120 --> 00:13:56.560
In the teens, the press escalated.
 One would evangelize and testify -

154
00:13:56.720 --> 00:14:03.480
-For non-Christian friends and for classmates and so on.

155
00:14:03.640 --> 00:14:08.280
If I am a coward and do not talk about Jesus, then it can lead to ...

156
00:14:08.440 --> 00:14:12.120
... someone's eternity is affected.

157
00:14:13.280 --> 00:14:20.520
It was a huge pressure: "If you don't, who should?"

158
00:14:20.680 --> 00:14:25.640
"Don't you think about the eternal souls of your friends?"

159
00:14:25.800 --> 00:14:29.200
This is very difficult to describe -

160
00:14:29.360 --> 00:14:36.320
- But I managed in some way to persuade myself that I wanted to.

161
00:14:36.480 --> 00:14:41.360
It almost felt like committing abuse on oneself.

162
00:14:41.520 --> 00:14:47.320
I didn't want to, but I told myself that I wanted to, and did it.

163
00:14:47.480 --> 00:14:52.040
I was talking about Jesus for my high school class.

164
00:14:55.240 --> 00:15:00.800
How does Amanda's mother think about what Amanda got to learn in church?

165
00:15:00.960 --> 00:15:05.040
Most young people who participate here have explicitly asked us -

166
00:15:05.200 --> 00:15:08.080
- Not contacting their families.

167
00:15:08.240 --> 00:15:12.240
But with some parents I have still had contact.

168
00:15:12.400 --> 00:15:16.720
It has been everything from sharp criticism for taking up the subject -

169
00:15:16.880 --> 00:15:22.640
- That parents told them that they regret things from the child's upbringing.

170
00:15:22.800 --> 00:15:28.880
For almost everyone, it is impossible to criticize their religious context.

171
00:15:29.040 --> 00:15:34.480
Amanda's mother still decides to sit in front of the camera.

172
00:15:36.240 --> 00:15:43.600
When your daughter today talks about what it was like for her, what do you think?

173
00:15:43.760 --> 00:15:48.440
I get really sad and giant.

174
00:15:48.600 --> 00:15:53.600
What has your daughter told you today, about how she has measured in the church?

175
00:15:53.760 --> 00:15:58.280
She has felt a lot of stress and anxiety.

176
00:15:58.440 --> 00:16:05.880
She is also forced how to dress, how to think.

177
00:16:06.040 --> 00:16:10.040
She couldn't think of guys, it was a sin.

178
00:16:10.200 --> 00:16:14.400
And when she sinned, she would fast and pray.

179
00:16:14.560 --> 00:16:17.600
And then that she was forced -

180
00:16:17.760 --> 00:16:22.760
- At school, tell about their faith for the whole class -

181
00:16:22.920 --> 00:16:27.000
- It created a lot of anxiety, anxiety and stress.

182
00:16:27.160 --> 00:16:30.760
- Did you know these things?
 - Not when it happened.

183
00:16:30.920 --> 00:16:34.280
I thought it was a safe place.

184
00:16:34.440 --> 00:16:39.680
How do you think about your own responsibility?
 You grew up within the Pentecostal movement -

185
00:16:39.840 --> 00:16:45.200
- And chose your daughter to grow up there.
 How do you think about it?

186
00:16:45.360 --> 00:16:52.520
It was only natural to follow where you have been your whole life yourself.

187
00:16:52.680 --> 00:16:58.240
It's like a homemade environment to be in.

188
00:16:58.400 --> 00:17:03.720
How was it for yourself to be in church when you were young?

189
00:17:03.880 --> 00:17:06.840
It was a bit both and, actually.

190
00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:12.440
I have had my nightmares when I was a kid.

191
00:17:12.600 --> 00:17:16.640
Then you had heard a lot about hell -

192
00:17:16.800 --> 00:17:20.800
- And that those who are Christians come to heaven.

193
00:17:20.960 --> 00:17:25.240
And we didn't know when we were going home to heaven.

194
00:17:25.400 --> 00:17:31.320
So sometime when I woke up alone in the house at home, I panicked:

195
00:17:31.480 --> 00:17:35.880
"Has he picked up them, and I'm still here alone?!"

196
00:17:36.040 --> 00:17:38.800
I ran around looking.

197
00:17:38.960 --> 00:17:43.440
Finally, I found them out on the site.
 But what a horror.

198
00:17:43.600 --> 00:17:49.040
Some things that you experienced as a child remain within the Pentecostal movement.

199
00:17:49.200 --> 00:17:52.920
Why didn't you want to protect your child from it?

200
00:17:53.080 --> 00:17:59.040
I thought we went on, that there wasn't, that we came further -

201
00:17:59.200 --> 00:18:03.400
- And that it was a little nicer teaching.

202
00:18:13.240 --> 00:18:18.240
When I left my faith and left the church so ...

203
00:18:19.480 --> 00:18:23.480
... I felt it was talking about this.

204
00:18:23.640 --> 00:18:28.200
I wanted to lift some things within the church and Christianity -

205
00:18:28.360 --> 00:18:31.280
- As I think can be harmful.

206
00:18:31.440 --> 00:18:36.400
My blog is very small.
 It's not that ...

207
00:18:36.560 --> 00:18:39.560
It is friends and family reading.

208
00:18:39.720 --> 00:18:43.520
It started to come in ...

209
00:18:43.680 --> 00:18:48.720
... very hard resistance from Christians.

210
00:18:48.880 --> 00:18:53.960
It was personal attacks, threats.

211
00:18:54.120 --> 00:19:02.320
It is difficult to describe disgust and the hatred directed at me.

212
00:19:02.480 --> 00:19:05.480
These people had in the past -

213
00:19:05.640 --> 00:19:10.000
—In the church context, when I thought they and was a Christian -

214
00:19:10.160 --> 00:19:13.160
- Treated me with love and care.

215
00:19:13.320 --> 00:19:19.600
It was a complete reversal, like I was almost no longer human.

216
00:19:19.760 --> 00:19:23.760
And that I deserved it, had to blame myself.

217
00:19:23.920 --> 00:19:27.920
- It was really awful.
 - How did the reactions look like?

218
00:19:28.080 --> 00:19:34.880
It was like almost hatred, threat ... it was emotional pressure.

219
00:19:35.040 --> 00:19:41.360
In the end she called me and said, "Mom, I don't want to live anymore."

220
00:19:56.440 --> 00:20:01.280
I have to sneak in here and hug you.

221
00:20:01.440 --> 00:20:05.360
Oh, now the microphone and everything.

222
00:20:07.600 --> 00:20:12.640
Amanda's mother wrestles with responsibility for having trusted a church-

223
00:20:12.800 --> 00:20:17.240
- There it turned out that her daughter was bad.

224
00:20:17.400 --> 00:20:22.240
For Karoline, the debt issue is heavier.

225
00:20:22.400 --> 00:20:27.400
There was so much she as a parent and Jehovah's Witness was invited -

226
00:20:27.560 --> 00:20:31.200
- To teach their children about.

227
00:20:31.360 --> 00:20:37.520
My duty was to raise them in the Bible's doctrine, bring them to meetings -

228
00:20:37.680 --> 00:20:42.520
- And teach them who to spend time with and how to behave.

229
00:20:42.680 --> 00:20:47.480
My duty was also to teach the children to stand up for "what they believe in" -

230
00:20:47.640 --> 00:20:50.480
- What we parents believe in -

231
00:20:50.640 --> 00:20:54.800
- With birthday celebrations and everything else they do not take part in.

232
00:20:54.960 --> 00:20:58.960
This is required for the children to stand up for.

233
00:20:59.120 --> 00:21:03.800
My duty as a parent is to teach children -

234
00:21:03.960 --> 00:21:07.160
- Defending their religion in school.

235
00:21:07.320 --> 00:21:11.920
One has films that teach parents to handle it -

236
00:21:12.080 --> 00:21:18.080
-And films that teach the children how to do it: Kevin and the Sofia films.

237
00:21:18.240 --> 00:21:24.840
- Why don't we celebrate birthdays?
 -Good question!
 How would you answer?

238
00:21:25.000 --> 00:21:28.000
Karoline: They go straight into the heart of the children.

239
00:21:28.160 --> 00:21:33.520
- Because Jehovah doesn't like it.
 -Good!
 And why doesn't he?

240
00:21:33.680 --> 00:21:37.600
Does it say that Jesus celebrated his birthday?

241
00:21:37.760 --> 00:21:39.640
Eh ... no.

242
00:21:39.800 --> 00:21:44.200
Just.
 But he said we would celebrate the memory of his death.

243
00:21:44.360 --> 00:21:47.960
He died for us so that we can live forever.

244
00:21:48.120 --> 00:21:54.120
The films illustrate how the parents should speak the child to the right -

245
00:21:54.280 --> 00:22:00.040
- With the Bible.
 The child may promise not to do it, and make up it.

246
00:22:00.200 --> 00:22:03.200
The important thing for us that parents are -

247
00:22:03.360 --> 00:22:07.640
- To educate the children to stand up for Jehovah's Witnesses.

248
00:22:08.440 --> 00:22:12.920
You like to get sweets and gifts?

249
00:22:13.080 --> 00:22:16.240
But would you like them now?

250
00:22:26.280 --> 00:22:30.080
When you celebrate birthdays you mix good things -

251
00:22:30.240 --> 00:22:32.840
- With things that Jehovah doesn't like.

252
00:22:33.000 --> 00:22:39.520
As a witness, why was it important to you that your children followed the doctrine?

253
00:22:39.680 --> 00:22:45.520
Even if you say that all witnesses love and help each other -

254
00:22:45.680 --> 00:22:50.920
- So you have very strong hierarchies in the parish community as well.

255
00:22:51.080 --> 00:22:56.040
Those in the middle are role models:

256
00:22:56.200 --> 00:23:02.680
Dads who have an appointment as elders and children who are exemplary.

257
00:23:02.840 --> 00:23:07.920
And for you to keep yourself in the middle, the children should be exemplary.

258
00:23:08.080 --> 00:23:12.480
There was always someone who was about to attend the meetings.

259
00:23:12.640 --> 00:23:17.920
There was no good socializing, so they froze them quite strongly.

260
00:23:18.080 --> 00:23:21.680
We did not spend time with them private-

261
00:23:21.840 --> 00:23:27.640
- The way we wanted our children to have the influence of the fine young people.

262
00:23:27.800 --> 00:23:32.960
What did you get for instructions as a parent about how you would behave -

263
00:23:33.120 --> 00:23:37.120
- If any of your children were excluded?

264
00:23:37.280 --> 00:23:41.760
A child who lives at home may do it until it moves away from home.

265
00:23:41.920 --> 00:23:46.960
Then you have no responsibility for them anymore.
 These are the clear instructions.

266
00:23:47.120 --> 00:23:51.680
- It is total social foreclosure.
 -What does that mean?

267
00:23:51.840 --> 00:23:55.840
You must not meet, not talk on the phone, do not hang out.

268
00:23:56.000 --> 00:24:01.000
You should treat your child as if it is dead.
 There is no longer.

269
00:24:01.160 --> 00:24:06.160
It is not in your reality, it is not part of your life.

270
00:24:06.320 --> 00:24:12.320
And that approach did you accept when you were in Jehovah's Witnesses?

271
00:24:12.480 --> 00:24:19.280
I was a witness, but I had a very hard time accepting it.

272
00:24:22.440 --> 00:24:28.000
How can religion become so important to choose your child?

273
00:24:28.160 --> 00:24:32.280
You choose God and the congregation before your own child.

274
00:24:32.440 --> 00:24:36.960
If you actually believe that there is really a god -

275
00:24:37.120 --> 00:24:42.960
—The one really is created by this god for an eternal life -

276
00:24:43.120 --> 00:24:46.680
–And you see your child choose it -

277
00:24:46.840 --> 00:24:53.840
- Then maybe you can compare it to a parent whose child becomes a heroinist.

278
00:24:54.000 --> 00:24:58.720
And the parent, who loves his child -

279
00:24:58.880 --> 00:25:02.520
- Inns that this is really a ...

280
00:25:02.680 --> 00:25:08.880
Becoming a heroinist is so dangerous and destructive that one must do everything -

281
00:25:09.040 --> 00:25:13.880
- To get the child on better thoughts.
 It is believed that it is the order.

282
00:25:14.040 --> 00:25:19.920
So a Jehovah's parent must get the child back to ...?

283
00:25:20.080 --> 00:25:26.360
Yes, I think, if you really believe in the doctrine you proclaim.

284
00:25:28.920 --> 00:25:32.320
What do you want today to say to your children -

285
00:25:32.480 --> 00:25:38.280
- That has grown up within Jehovah's Witnesses, because you were a witness?

286
00:25:38.440 --> 00:25:44.240
My love is neither less nor more than when I was a Jehovah's Witness.

287
00:25:44.400 --> 00:25:47.160
My mother's love is the same.

288
00:25:47.320 --> 00:25:52.760
I hope they have a good life, but I also apologize.

289
00:25:52.920 --> 00:25:56.720
They could have had a much better childhood.

290
00:25:56.880 --> 00:26:00.880
A childhood where they did not have to be afraid of Harmagedon.

291
00:26:01.040 --> 00:26:05.600
A childhood that was carefree, where they were only allowed to be children -

292
00:26:05.760 --> 00:26:09.920
- And didn't think about who was suitable to be with.

293
00:26:10.080 --> 00:26:15.080
A childhood filled with sports activities instead of service on Saturdays.

294
00:26:15.240 --> 00:26:20.120
Or birthday party instead of meetings Sunday afternoon.

295
00:26:20.280 --> 00:26:24.560
A childhood where they got to choose who they wanted to be with -

296
00:26:24.720 --> 00:26:31.480
- Rebound of religion, but only because of interests and personality.

297
00:26:31.640 --> 00:26:35.440
I took it away from them.

298
00:26:37.840 --> 00:26:42.880
Yes, for many parents it is only afterwards that it becomes clear -

299
00:26:43.040 --> 00:26:47.320
- How faith affected their children.

300
00:26:47.480 --> 00:26:52.720
But it is not only parents that a child meets during their upbringing.

301
00:27:02.840 --> 00:27:07.440
Hello!
 Welcome into the car.

302
00:27:08.160 --> 00:27:11.400
-How's it going?
 You're ready?
 -Yes.

303
00:27:11.560 --> 00:27:15.400
-Let's go.
 Against Knutby!
 –Yes.

304
00:27:17.600 --> 00:27:20.160
A 26-year-old woman was arrested today-

305
00:27:20.320 --> 00:27:24.920
-Missed for involvement in the murder of the 23-year-old shot in Knutby ...

306
00:27:25.080 --> 00:27:27.760
The pastor in Knutby was arrested today ...

307
00:27:27.920 --> 00:27:33.080
Helge Fossmo admits that he was involved in the murder and attempted murder.

308
00:27:33.240 --> 00:27:38.920
In the middle of the storm that was the "sect Knutby" Linnea grew up.

309
00:27:39.080 --> 00:27:45.480
Now she wants to know: Why could no one at school help her?

310
00:27:48.840 --> 00:27:51.800
-In front.
 Does it feel okay?
 -Yes.

311
00:27:51.960 --> 00:27:54.320
Let's go.

312
00:28:10.120 --> 00:28:13.120
