1
00:00:02,200 --> 00:00:06,200
Can a vegetable have inheritance from a fish?

2
00:00:06,360 --> 00:00:12,400
Can you become a copy of your grandmother and can a bacterium make medicine?

3
00:00:12,560 --> 00:00:18,480
The answer is yes.
 Strange but true.
 And everything has to do with genetic engineering.

4
00:00:26,280 --> 00:00:31,160
In 1865, the Austrian monk presents Gregor Mendel-

5
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:35,920
-How properties appear to be inherited from one generation to another.

6
00:00:36,080 --> 00:00:40,200
This after he studied 29,000 pea plant-

7
00:00:40,360 --> 00:00:45,320
-What became the starting point for genetics or heredity doctrine.

8
00:00:45,480 --> 00:00:49,720
But it takes 100 years before you get an overall picture.

9
00:00:49,880 --> 00:00:56,880
That the DNA molecule and all its genes gave an organism its properties.

10
00:00:57,040 --> 00:01:03,360
Since then, a huge effort has been made to map the organisms' DNA-

11
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:08,440
-to try to understand which gene is linked to which trait.

12
00:01:08,600 --> 00:01:14,360
Hand in hand with this a new technology has grown - genetic engineering.

13
00:01:14,520 --> 00:01:20,640
It has made it possible to change genes of living organisms.

14
00:01:20,800 --> 00:01:26,400
For a long time we have characterized animals through breeding and plants through processing.

15
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:34,040
But it has taken many generations before you have been able to see a result.

16
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:41,160
After realizing the importance

17
00:01:41,320 --> 00:01:47,240
-There more experiments began.
 One such example is the sheep dolly-

18
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:52,200
-A of the first genetic engineering experiments carried out on a mammal.

19
00:01:52,360 --> 00:01:55,360
The very purpose was to investigate-

20
00:01:55,520 --> 00:02:00,560
-If it was possible to clone, make an exact copy, of a mammal.

21
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:07,160
One moved a cell nucleus into a fertilized egg from another sheep-

22
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:12,680
-and it worked.
 Sheep Dolly was born in Scotland in 1996-

23
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:19,040
-And the genetic mass was not the parents' but the sheep that donated the cell nucleus.

24
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:25,320
Dolly proved that one could choose which genetic mass an animal would get.

25
00:02:25,480 --> 00:02:29,680
Gene technology became great in the plant and food industry.

26
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:36,520
The processing grew to make plants durable and get greater returns.

27
00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:40,120
GMO technology made its entry.

28
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:44,480
GMO stands for genetically modified organisms-

29
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:50,480
-What means that one adds a gene from one organism to another-

30
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:54,440
-To give the other characteristics.

31
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:57,440
You use bacteria to help.

32
00:02:57,600 --> 00:03:04,280
The desired gene is moved into a DNA molecule that is inserted into the bacterium.

33
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:11,080
You then enter the bacterium into a cell on the organism you want to change.

34
00:03:11,240 --> 00:03:17,720
The new molecule can marry in the DNA.
 It changes the genetic mass.

35
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:25,960
One can take a gene from an ice ocean fish and place it in a vegetable-

36
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:29,320
-and make it more cold-resistant-

37
00:03:29,480 --> 00:03:35,360
-or make a crop that is more durable to pesticides-

38
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:40,200
-So that the weeds die but not the crop.

39
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:43,600
The views on this fall apart.

40
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:49,280
The skepticals believe that there are risks in manipulating the genetic mass.

41
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:56,280
In Sweden, foods that contain more than 1 % GMO must be labeled.

42
00:03:56,440 --> 00:04:00,720
The method would not work on a human being.

43
00:04:00,880 --> 00:04:06,880
Therefore, it became a fuss when an extraordinary discovery was made in 2012.

44
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:10,280
A method that could be used on human-

45
00:04:10,440 --> 00:04:13,600
-Top the technology to a whole new level.

46
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:20,800
Instead of adding genes, it is about changing the inheritance mass.

47
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:29,280
I'm talking about Crispr-Cas9 or the "Gen Sax" which received the Nobel Prize in 2020.

48
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:36,720
It was Emmanuelle Charpentier and Jennifer Doudna who came up with the method.

49
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:42,120
You could say that CrisPr-CAS9, the gene scissors, is an editing tool.

50
00:04:42,280 --> 00:04:46,640
A tool that can find genar-

51
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:51,800
-and remove or replace parts of the living organisms.

52
00:04:51,960 --> 00:04:58,440
The gene scissors consists of two parts, one RNA and the enzyme CAS9.

53
00:04:58,600 --> 00:05:02,520
RNA is looking up the gene-

54
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:08,120
-So that the enzyme CAS9, which is the scissors itself, can make the clip.

55
00:05:08,280 --> 00:05:13,640
Their collaboration makes them possible to make changes with high precision.

56
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:18,320
In the medical field, this technology is seen as a revolution.

57
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:24,560
Compared to GMO, the gene scissors can also be used on us humans.

58
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:28,640
Genteknik has become a huge research area-

59
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:31,760
-And new progress is being made all the time.

60
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:38,520
The hopes are great to find treatments for serious illnesses.

61
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:42,960
But it is important that the work does not go for the forth-

62
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:46,200
-Out is made as secure as possible.

63
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:50,800
If we cut wrong, it will have devastating consequences.

64
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:04,800
