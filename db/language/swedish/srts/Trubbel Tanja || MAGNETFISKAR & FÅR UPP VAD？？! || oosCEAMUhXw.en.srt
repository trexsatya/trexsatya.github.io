00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:14.698
Are you tagged old man

00:00:14.698 --> 00:00:16.974
[Both in chorus] Hello

4
00:00:16.974 --> 00:00:19.648
The servant darling

5
00:00:19.648 --> 00:00:22.097
 Congratulations in arrears!
 - Gosh!

6
00:00:22.097 --> 00:00:23.634
Gift to me

7
00:00:23.634 --> 00:00:25.543
 Yeah!
 - We will empty it today.

8
00:00:25.543 --> 00:00:26.616
We will do that.

9
00:00:26.616 --> 00:00:29.937
Champagne Nah, you bought champagne!

10
00:00:29.937 --> 00:00:31.663
 I have!
 - For real!

11
00:00:31.663 --> 00:00:35.692
But God can we sabotage it later?

12
00:00:35.692 --> 00:00:37.861
 Do you know how to do it?
 - Yes, I've done it.

13
00:00:37.861 --> 00:00:40.079
I have video proofs, do you want to see

14
00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:43.222
It's the sickest in my entire life, I saw a tictoch ...

15
00:00:43.222 --> 00:00:45.442
... where there were hacks on how to sabotage.

16
00:00:45.442 --> 00:00:47.558
It's really easy.

17

[Rock music]

18
00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:58.504
What is needed is that it is cold, preferably that it has been a bit in the freezer before.

19
00:00:58.504 --> 00:01:01.218
So you should take everything around.

20
00:01:01.218 --> 00:01:02.724
So you just pull on this one.

21
00:01:02.724 --> 00:01:08.113
Listen damn careful now, because you will be learned something like this educational before.

22
00:01:08.113 --> 00:01:12.220
This little ... where you see that the bottle is sealed, the seam yes.

23
00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:13.668
Well said

24
00:01:13.668 --> 00:01:16.720
Are you sitting backing my brother here now, is that what you are doing

25
00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:17.822
[Laughter] No then

26
00:01:17.822 --> 00:01:22.705
I turned years yesterday, and it ended with a fight between me and my brother, you can say.

27
00:01:22.705 --> 00:01:29.126
But it always ends so when I'm with my brother and drink.

28
00:01:29.126 --> 00:01:33.616
He knows exactly which buttons to press, so I get started on all cylinders

29
00:01:33.616 --> 00:01:36.707
I have a bump on my arm today because he hit me so hard.

30
00:01:36.707 --> 00:01:37.784
And mom says:

31
00:01:37.784 --> 00:01:39.065
[Light, dedicated voice] "But it wasn't that hard"

32
00:01:39.065 --> 00:01:42.188
I have too damn bruise and bump today, of course it was hard

33
00:01:42.188 --> 00:01:44.286
We try to plan here, after all,

34
00:01:44.286 --> 00:01:50.180
Because today we are going ... magnetic fishing I forgot for the fuck the magnet at home!

35
00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:52.270
 No?
 - Yes, haha!

36
00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:56.063
[Laugh]

37
00:01:56.063 --> 00:01:58.996
I came on it now

38
00:01:58.996 --> 00:02:01.250
I only have the liquor with me

39
00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:03.475

Damn pat wood

43
00:02:13.703 --> 00:02:18.259
We don't really know where to fish.

44
00:02:18.259 --> 00:02:23.688
Our biggest problem is that someone has to drive, and then someone has to be sober.

45
00:02:23.688 --> 00:02:27.299
So we sit and divide if it is worth driving.

46
00:02:27.299 --> 00:02:28.982
Then we might as well take one in town.

47
00:02:28.982 --> 00:02:33.117
We are so damn thirsty, it's Saturday today too.

48
00:02:33.117 --> 00:02:36.475
Now damn, I hope it is enough for 17 meters.

49
00:02:36.475 --> 00:02:40.456
 Should I send in the first then?
 - Okay then.

50
00:02:40.456 --> 00:02:44.180
Should I throw far or right down

51
00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:50.133
I don't know, it feels like ... maybe you should throw it far out.

52
00:02:50.133 --> 00:02:51.991
Then you pull it in a little.

53
00:02:51.991 --> 00:02:55.319

54
00:02:55.319 --> 00:03:00.151
Now we bowl and hope we ... you can get rich in this

55
00:03:00.151 --> 00:03:02.052
Yes maybe.

56
00:03:02.052 --> 00:03:04.598
Be careful not to spill the beer.

57
00:03:04.598 --> 00:03:05.951
 Good consistency splash.
 - Yes.

00:03:05.951 --> 00:03:08.733
Take in now take in as hell!

59
00:03:08.733 --> 00:03:10.758

It shrugs a little when I pull like this, it feels a bit like you fish.

We do too, but.

69
00:03:47.526 --> 00:03:52.551
I have something or?

70
00:03:52.551 --> 00:03:55.070
Well, yes?
 Or?

71
00:03:55.070 --> 00:03:56.438
No...

72
00:03:56.438 --> 00:03:59.237
Have they cleaned the lake or what is the question of

73
00:03:59.237 --> 00:04:03.796
 We must be silent when fishing.
 - Yes, we must be silent now that we fish.

74
00:04:03.796 --> 00:04:06.460
 Otherwise we scare away ... - scares the fish away.

75
00:04:06.460 --> 00:04:09.925
This is really the right kind of fishing for us.

76
00:04:09.925 --> 00:04:11.490
Which is never silent.

77
00:04:11.490 --> 00:04:16.063
 We are silent but still we get no pacifier.
 - But I think it's a scrap.

78
00:04:16.063 --> 00:04:17.700
That you have to be silent.

79
00:04:17.700 --> 00:04:22.586
Imagine large fishing vessels how much they sound and bonels, and how much fish they get.

80
00:04:22.586 --> 00:04:24.311
I think it's a scream ...

81
00:04:24.311 --> 00:04:27.663
... as all dads said because they want peace and quiet in the boat.

82
00:04:27.663 --> 00:04:30.816
I believe that, and now everyone believes it just

83
00:04:30.816 --> 00:04:32.881
What is like this

84
00:04:32.881 --> 00:04:36.946
 Eh ... - what is it?

85
00:04:36.946 --> 00:04:38.270
When you stand like this

86
00:04:38.270 --> 00:04:40.354
 It's probably throwing a bullet or?
 - Toss marbles.

87
00:04:40.354 --> 00:04:42.450
Now damn ...

91
00:04:50.841 --> 00:04:52.334
 Good throw!
 - Was it?

92
00:04:52.334 --> 00:04:54.007

 Or there are stones I go against.

97
00:05:07.077 --> 00:05:10.932
 Ah Nah, totally fucking empty again.
 - Nothing.

98
00:05:10.932 --> 00:05:12.464
If you think logically now ...

99
00:05:12.464 --> 00:05:14.211
If the boats come from there,

100
00:05:14.211 --> 00:05:15.730
And this bridge doesn't go up ...

101
00:05:15.730 --> 00:05:17.109
Then no one is going here

102
00:05:17.109 --> 00:05:20.087

103
00:05:20.087 --> 00:05:22.897
Who should go and throw in stuff then

104
00:05:22.897 --> 00:05:25.682

 - Yes but that's kind of what you want to find!

105

[Laughs] a coffin type.

106
00:05:28.493 --> 00:05:30.289
 It's something!
 - I knew that too, that's it?

107
00:05:30.289 --> 00:05:32.033
Though the magnet released.

108
00:05:32.033 --> 00:05:35.977
 Wasn't this where you knew anything too?
 - Yes!

109
00:05:35.977 --> 00:05:37.482
What the hell can it be

110
00:05:37.482 --> 00:05:40.236
That was exactly what I felt.
 You feel that you have something,

111
00:05:40.236 --> 00:05:42.773
But as soon as you pull, it feels like it becomes easy.

112
00:05:42.773 --> 00:05:45.048
A spoon

113
00:05:45.048 --> 00:05:47.572
Yes so damn good!

114
00:05:47.572 --> 00:05:49.232

00:05:49.232 --> 00:05:51.200

 - Thanks!

 - A screw...

Fy damn what a good thing, it feels good that we got something up, then we know it works.

120
00:06:04.550 --> 00:06:06.356
It feels like it is sitting against this type.

121
00:06:06.356 --> 00:06:08.557
It sits rock hard.
 - No!
 Damn.

122
00:06:08.557 --> 00:06:09.535
Now it released.

123
00:06:09.535 --> 00:06:11.203
Here type.

124
00:06:11.203 --> 00:06:16.103
 It's something mega ... - Mega magnetic.

125
00:06:16.103 --> 00:06:18.985
It is still on now and I have lifted it from the ground.

127
00:06:21.376 --> 00:06:23.759
 Did it follow from the ground?
 - Yes now I have lifted from the ground.

128
00:06:23.759 --> 00:06:27.496
Can't we go out on the dock there then or does it lift?

129
00:06:27.496 --> 00:06:29.418
It has lifted from the ground.

00:06:42.428 --> 00:06:46.375
It starts to decline type.

134
00:06:46.375 --> 00:06:49.536
 It's still on

135
00:06:49.536 --> 00:06:51.536
No no no no!

136
00:06:51.536 --> 00:06:54.331

-—-—-

138
00:06:56.436 --> 00:06:59.296
How far was this then

139
00:06:59.296 --> 00:07:03.327
No f*tta, I dropped it.

140
00:07:03.327 --> 00:07:06.737
Released it-no!

141
00:07:06.737 --> 00:07:08.103
It's on

142
00:07:08.103 --> 00:07:10.059
What

145
00:07:19.781 --> 00:07:23.085
 It's still on!
 - It is certainly kind of a buoy or something so boring.

146
00:07:23.085 --> 00:07:26.303
There is something red

Nah

[Loudly] Well what!

150
00:07:34.007 --> 00:07:36.130
What

151
00:07:36.130 --> 00:07:38.093
Is it true

152
00:07:38.093 --> 00:07:40.403
Or ... no ...

Can it with this

155
00:07:45.662 --> 00:07:47.642
It's a bike it's a bike!

156
00:07:47.642 --> 00:07:49.477
We must have a tactic here now.

157
00:07:49.477 --> 00:07:51.724
Should we pull it right up or go with it to the edge

158
00:07:51.724 --> 00:07:54.674
 Up?
 - Yes!

159
00:07:54.674 --> 00:07:56.709
We got a bike

160
00:07:56.709 --> 00:07:58.446
I have a bike now

161
00:07:58.446 --> 00:08:01.247
No no!

00:08:01.247 --> 00:08:05.209
No damn ...

163
00:08:05.209 --> 00:08:06.901
Damn...

164
00:08:06.901 --> 00:08:08.813
We have to get it up

165
00:08:08.813 --> 00:08:12.472
I think it gets too heavy for the magnet when it comes above the water surface.

166
00:08:12.472 --> 00:08:14.480
It is just that it can handle it in water.

167
00:08:14.480 --> 00:08:17.860
 Pull to the page, I think.
 - We drive aside.

168
00:08:17.860 --> 00:08:19.213
This bike should fuck up.

169
00:08:19.213 --> 00:08:21.556
One would have had a hook or something.

170
00:08:21.556 --> 00:08:24.002
"I have a bike now" [laughter]

171
00:08:24.002 --> 00:08:28.468
I've wanted to have a bike for a long time.
 It is just to change tires and it works.

Don `t you think so

173
00:08:32.644 --> 00:08:35.040
Do you have it

174
00:08:35.040 --> 00:08:37.899
Okay we go to the page ...

175
00:08:37.899 --> 00:08:40.160
But it is shit -heavy

176
00:08:40.160 --> 00:08:44.539
I say it, I fucking hurt in the back.

177
00:08:44.539 --> 00:08:47.158
The back of the back ... lumbar spine.

178
00:08:47.158 --> 00:08:50.490
But now I have something heavy on here or.

-—-—-

180
00:08:53.940 --> 00:08:56.758
Yes, but what is this?
 A knife?

181
00:08:56.758 --> 00:09:03.639
