00:00:07,820 --> 00:00:10,000
It's really nice!

2
00:00:10,140 --> 00:00:12,360
Great really!

3
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:16,400
And a little strange that I have to be.

4
00:00:16,680 --> 00:00:18,540
But great fun!

5
00:00:21,720 --> 00:00:25,020
It was at Halmstad University that I

6
00:00:25,060 --> 00:00:28,500
Saw a poster that Save the Children had set up.

7
00:00:28,860 --> 00:00:31,800
That poster led me to find it

8
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:34,660
Which I wanted to work with, namely children's rights.

9
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,520
The training itself also gave me

10
00:00:37,560 --> 00:00:39,740
The tools I needed.

11
00:00:39,740 --> 00:00:42,540
So what I do today is thanks

12
00:00:42,540 --> 00:00:45,400
Save the Children and Halmstad University.
