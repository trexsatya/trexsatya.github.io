1
00:00:23,380 --> 00:00:28,920
-What is it for a car?
 It is a Ferrari F40 replica of a 1988 model.

2
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:32,840
The whole car I have done myself.
 I have done everything you see.

3
00:00:33,460 --> 00:00:37,400
-Hello!
 Hello, welcome back.

4
00:00:38,220 --> 00:00:42,820
-I'm ready for section 2?
 Yeah, then we drive.

5
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:49,160
Here you have the first F40'n made.

6
00:00:49,880 --> 00:00:54,680
And pictures of when Ferrari tests the F40'n in wind tunnel and runs it.

7
00:00:54,860 --> 00:01:01,000
This is the first car is the only one with five gills.
 The other F40 has only four gills.

8
00:01:01,880 --> 00:01:07,620
This car was standing at the Ferrari Museum long before a famous person had to take it.

9
00:01:07,620 --> 00:01:12,880
-This is no Ferrari F40 that you have.
 No, you should be clear about it.

10
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:19,300
There are people who can look oblique then.
 This is one F40 and it is built as I want it.

11
00:01:19,300 --> 00:01:24,340
Then there is always someone who has opinions.

12
00:01:24,340 --> 00:01:29,280
I like this car and I have done the one I want it and it is a tribute to the F40.

13
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:35,060
The chassis I have made my own pipe frame but how I want to keep it for myself.

14
00:01:35,060 --> 00:01:40,720
I don't want to share it.
 I can show a picture of it but nothing more.

15
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:44,380
-When people understand what does a Ferrari F40 cost?

16
00:01:44,380 --> 00:01:50,000
Prices have gone up like all other cars, but you will probably have to pay 10-13 million.

17
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:57,260
-All have 10-13 million at the bank?
 Well, all car mechanics have at home.

18
00:01:57,260 --> 00:02:02,480
-Refls, tires & brakes?
 There I have chosen Oz-racing rims 18 ”.

19
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:07,740
Before I changed brakes, I had 17 "rims that looked like the original rims.

20
00:02:07,740 --> 00:02:12,320
But those rims did not fit when I changed brakes.
 -Where where the brake caliper too big?

21
00:02:12,320 --> 00:02:17,420
Yes exactly.
 Then I bought 3-divided 18 "split rims.

22
00:02:17,420 --> 00:02:22,020
I did the rims so they seem to have center bolt.

23
00:02:22,020 --> 00:02:26,560
Center bolt has F40 original.

24
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:34,440
These are these rims I want but in 18 "and I will try to find a couple but need to save money first.

25
00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:41,600
This is from a drag racing car that I bought.
 Brake discs are Wilwood and JFZ brake caliper.

26
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:48,580
There is a large 4-piston brake caliper.
 The brake disc is 330x32 so there are thick slices.

27
00:02:48,580 --> 00:02:53,700
It is my own hub that I built.

28
00:02:53,700 --> 00:02:57,980
I have used A-arms as a link arms both up and down.

29
00:02:57,980 --> 00:03:04,720
Then there are adjustable coilovers front and rear I have fixed dampers.

30
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:12,640
This is the Porsche 928 brake caliper and then a Skoda Octavia RS brake caliper for the handbrake.

31
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:17,340
There is no handbom on the car otherwise and this brake caliper fits well.

32
00:03:17,340 --> 00:03:28,740
Brake discs are from VW Passat from 2010. Slices are 317x21 mm and fit well at the back of the car.

33
00:03:28,740 --> 00:03:35,620
It is a damn fun to get everything together.
 It should fit and look good and work.

34
00:03:35,620 --> 00:03:41,680
A lot of time is spent on what to use for parts and how it should fit together.

35
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:52,820
The drive shaft rear consists of 3 different parts from 3 different cars.
 When you build with different parts it becomes difficult.

36
00:03:52,820 --> 00:03:57,000
-You have made all the boxes for yourself.
 It's not glass panes?

37
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:05,860
No it is 4 mm lexan plastic with splitter film.
 It's like a real box but in plastic.

38
00:04:05,860 --> 00:04:14,340
-Do you have scored the plastic yourself?
 Yes I have done it with angle grinder and sanded.

39
00:04:14,340 --> 00:04:22,220
-With angle grinding, does not melt the plastic?
 Yes it does but then you have to cut inside and grind.

40
00:04:22,220 --> 00:04:27,680
-Is the windshield also in lexan plastic?
 Yes it is also in plastic and so did the original.

41
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:32,160
I think the original got a glass pane in 1992 but is not sure.

42
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:39,420
I first had a Porsche 928 engine but it didn't fit so well with the gearbox.

43
00:04:39,420 --> 00:04:45,780
I threw it out and put in an Audi A8 V8 of 4.2 liters instead.

44
00:04:45,780 --> 00:04:53,600
I have worked at Audi for 17 years and it is a good engine.
 So I decided to use one.

45
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:59,760
I know the engines and aluminum V8an weighs a bit.

46
00:04:59,760 --> 00:05:08,560
It became much easier to fit in with the gearbox.
 I built my own flywheel and clutch.

47
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:13,500
-Where did you find this engine?
 I bought it from a crashed car in Stockholm.

48
00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:21,640
I know it worked when I picked it up.
 I have gone through the engine and painted some covers.

49
00:05:21,640 --> 00:05:28,000
The engine is silver in the middle but it does not fit here so I repainted it.

50
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:31,000
T04 turbo aggregates below.

51
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:35,880
Both turbo go to the Weastegat who sits here.

52
00:05:35,880 --> 00:05:39,780
I have rebuilt gas dampers for other stuff.

53
00:05:39,780 --> 00:05:49,060
The air to Intercoolers comes from the inner screens.

54
00:05:49,060 --> 00:05:57,220
Race cats are sitting on.
 The exhaust system is just under a meter.

55
00:05:57,220 --> 00:06:00,420
-Hold people opinions that you have chosen a German engine?

56
00:06:00,420 --> 00:06:07,260
Well, there is both and the main thing that it is V8 and double turbo I think.

57
00:06:07,260 --> 00:06:12,260
-Had you built a chassis for a Porsche Motor?
 Yes I had.

58
00:06:12,260 --> 00:06:15,300
I had built the chassis at the back for the Porsche 928 engine.

59
00:06:15,300 --> 00:06:22,100
I turned the whole chassis into this engine.
 Then I rebuilt the entire rear wagon.

60
00:06:22,100 --> 00:06:28,000
It is the engine that has been in since the inspection.
 I haven't done anything with the car since then.

61
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:32,560
-Where do you get hold of all parts?
 You can order because.

62
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:36,760
The cats are from KL-racing.

63
00:06:36,760 --> 00:06:45,760
I had oil cooler from another car in the garage that I did not use.

64
00:06:45,960 --> 00:06:51,980
Turbo I bought new ones.
 Intercoolers I bought new ones from KL-racing.

65
00:06:51,980 --> 00:06:56,160
The hoses come from Do88.

66
00:06:56,160 --> 00:07:01,060
These are Santo hoses that I bought here in locally.

67
00:07:01,060 --> 00:07:07,260
These clamps are not optimal if you have higher charging pressure.

68
00:07:07,260 --> 00:07:12,320
-How much do you charge?
 0.5 bar and that's nothing.

69
00:07:12,320 --> 00:07:17,080
It's a fun machine.
 -What does the engine have for performance?

70
00:07:17,080 --> 00:07:19,880
I do not know.
 I have not tried the engine too full.

71
00:07:19,880 --> 00:07:26,740
The idea is not to be the fastest.
 It should go and drive with it.

72
00:07:26,740 --> 00:07:34,380
I should not be the fastest and operate around on a track.
 It should hold and I drive hard it just breaks.

73
00:07:34,380 --> 00:07:37,180
The plan is to drive without having to screw.

74
00:07:37,180 --> 00:07:41,680
The hardest thing has been to make the gear control.

75
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:47,000
Wires that will steer the backdrop forwards that will match a 6 -switched box with back.

76
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:51,060
I think it's been the hardest on the whole car.

77
00:07:51,060 --> 00:07:56,060
There are many holes in the body that air goes through.

78
00:07:56,060 --> 00:08:01,780
Here air comes in through the hose that will cool down the turbo.

79
00:08:01,780 --> 00:08:06,880
The warm air goes out through the grid at the back.

80
00:08:06,880 --> 00:08:11,900
-Yeah, the warm air comes out here.

81
00:08:11,900 --> 00:08:16,580
This is original Ferrari F40 taillight that I ordered from England.

82
00:08:16,580 --> 00:08:20,100
I have made the frames around the lights and the whole frame with grilles with.

83
00:08:20,100 --> 00:08:25,540
-What does the rear light cost?
 They cost 5000 SEK/piece.

84
00:08:25,540 --> 00:08:30,040
-You're joking!!
 It was worth it but now they are cheaper.

85
00:08:30,040 --> 00:08:36,920
Think you can buy them for SEK 3000/piece.
 Or used online but mine are new.

86
00:08:36,920 --> 00:08:40,760
5000 SEK /piece !!
 It is SEK 20,000 for all 4.

87
00:08:40,760 --> 00:08:49,300
All parts have made the car quite expensive.

88
00:08:49,300 --> 00:08:54,520
-5000 SEK / piece is completely crazy!
 Everything is so incredibly expensive.

89
00:08:54,520 --> 00:09:01,000
A rear window costs SEK 56,000 so I can't afford it so I had to do one myself.

90
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:06,260
Side mirrors Original costs SEK 26,000.

91
00:09:06,260 --> 00:09:16,520
-WAVA NOW, COST SUCH A RUTA 56,000 !! ??
 Yes, these are really strange prices.

92
00:09:16,520 --> 00:09:24,060
I made a template in masonite that I have spaced up to see how big the holes should be ...

93
00:09:24,060 --> 00:09:30,360
... on the real box.
 I have since cut up holes and glued.

94
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:35,060
Because I couldn't afford to buy the real box.

95
00:09:35,060 --> 00:09:41,520
It didn't take that long to do.
 It took me a couple of hours without any trouble.

96
00:09:41,520 --> 00:09:46,700
I really want to redo it because I'm not really happy.

97
00:09:46,700 --> 00:09:50,220
It must be so until further notice so I get done with the car.

98
00:09:50,220 --> 00:09:56,880
These mirrors come from Corvette C5.
 The original is a little more straight but these are good.

99
00:09:56,880 --> 00:10:04,860
The car is 2 meters wide and I look back with these which is the idea.

100
00:10:04,860 --> 00:10:11,640
-It is also very low.
 Yes, the total height is 112 cm from the ground.

101
00:10:11,640 --> 00:10:18,200
I have weighed it on a race because I want the weight distribution front and rear and per wheel.

102
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:22,340
And be able to weigh in for the springs.

103
00:10:22,340 --> 00:10:29,840
The car weighs without oil in the engine, no fuel and no person in the car weighs 1082 kg.

104
00:10:29,840 --> 00:10:34,240
I think that is good.
 -To be a sheet car, it's great.

105
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:37,720
Everyone thinks sheet metal is very heavy but it is not.

106
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:42,280
If it is just sheet metal and nothing else it does not weigh that much.

107
00:10:42,280 --> 00:10:49,400
-How thick sheet have you used?
 It is 0.8 and then it is 2 mm in the bottom of the car.

108
00:10:49,400 --> 00:10:53,600
It is thicker on the bottom because you do not want something to happen.

109
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:58,660
-Why is it called plate lady?
 When I had it exhibited at the Elmia fair ...

110
00:10:58,660 --> 00:11:04,580
... so there were so many who had their own reg signs.
 To see the difference between my car and a real car online.

111
00:11:04,580 --> 00:11:12,060
I wanted something so I put Plåtlady there because the car is made in sheet metal and Lady is red.

112
00:11:12,060 --> 00:11:18,060
I want to be own with something and there is only one F40 in the world that is in sheet metal.

113
00:11:18,060 --> 00:11:23,660
I have chosen to do it just why it goes.
 It doesn't have to be in plastic.

114
00:11:23,660 --> 00:11:31,480
Another thing that a F40 must have is the recessed emblem in the wing.

115
00:11:31,480 --> 00:11:38,860
I have cut out and put a plate behind and then drove with a Dremel and it took a couple of hours.

116
00:11:38,860 --> 00:11:44,260
-Ferrari red learn the car to be?
 Yes it is lacquered in Ferraris red.

117
00:11:44,260 --> 00:11:47,840
-The weird would be otherwise.
 Yes that's true.

118
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:52,160
Now the car is just lacquered.
 When I had the car at the Elmia fair a few years ago.

119
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:55,900
I mounted it and pulled on color to see what it would look like.

120
00:11:55,900 --> 00:12:00,500
Then the varnish would be for a few years so the car to move a bit.

121
00:12:00,500 --> 00:12:08,940
Now you can grind it out and paint it as it should be with varnish and clear varnish.

122
00:12:08,940 --> 00:12:12,860
I don't have that now.
 Now it's just varnish.

123
00:12:12,860 --> 00:12:18,700
In the coming year it will be sanded and varnished so that it will be perfect.

124
00:12:18,700 --> 00:12:23,740
-When can you see this on the road?
 Yes, it is partly inspected.

125
00:12:23,740 --> 00:12:28,340
It is SRFO inspected but there is run and sound test left.

126
00:12:28,340 --> 00:12:32,640
It is ready to be inspected now.
 It should be done in 2 steps.

127
00:12:32,640 --> 00:12:37,580
One step is to check the chassis that it looks like a car.

128
00:12:37,580 --> 00:12:41,540
Step 2 is run & sound sample so that it works like a car on the road.

129
00:12:41,540 --> 00:12:47,640
That is what is left.
 Then you go to the car testing and rules inspections.

130
00:12:47,640 --> 00:12:52,440
-There are many who want you to start the car.
 -But then you have to wait, right.

131
00:12:52,440 --> 00:12:59,900
Well then you have to wait until spring.
 -Then I'll have to come back.

132
00:12:59,900 --> 00:13:09,100
-It's not weather outside.
 No, it's cold and snow outside so I don't want to back out.

133
00:13:09,100 --> 00:13:12,920
-I have to make a return visit instead.
 Nice that we look forward to.

134
00:13:12,920 --> 00:13:17,600
-I can say that you can say.

135
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:23,900
-Fantastic, 1000-thanks because you took the time.
 Thank you for yourself for coming and thank you everyone who is watching.

136
00:13:23,900 --> 00:13:26,780
-See you later!
