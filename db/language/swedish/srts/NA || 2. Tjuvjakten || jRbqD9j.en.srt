1
00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:29.640
Billy!

2
00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:43.160
- Fan, I'm hungry.
 -Me too.

3
00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:47.360
We fill this one once and for all.

4
00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.280
There is only one thing to do.

5
00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:05.920
- The municipality has withdrawn the hunting right.
 - I shit in!

6
00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:10.360
Our family has been hunting here for generations.

7
00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:16.760
You should not look like a hungry goat.
 The freezer should be full.

8
00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:20.880
Yes but, Leif ... it's a big freezer.

9
00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:24.200
I must be a little effective.

10
00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:32.400
- clear, Billy.
 –Okej, Mr. Leif.

11
00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:38.280
Blue Eagle Is Ready.
 Starting Engines in Two, Three ...

12
00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:43.120
-Sorry, I Mean Three, Two ... - just drive, Billy!

13
00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:45.560
... one!

14
00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:59.240
One in my sight!
 - Pass on, large wild boar 200 meters to the right.

15
00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:07.120
-Hit!
 - Nice!
 Enemy Down.

16
00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:15.040
Satan ... - Pass on, big fucking moose 300 meters ahead.

17
00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:20.120
Ready to Engage.

18
00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:29.080
-Hit!
 - Fuck you, good sniper!

19
00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:31.840
Come on now, Leffe!

20
00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:37.600
Hit!

21
00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:47.280
Okay, Mr. Leif, Lock and Load.
 Huge Pig Incoming!

22
00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:54.840
Oh fuck.
 False Alarm, Leif.
 It was just an old bitch walking.

23
00:02:55.000 --> 00:03:02.080
Billy, put off with that fucking English.
 Sharpening now!
 Be prepared.

24
00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:12.000
Billy, now we fill the freezer!

25
00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:19.680
That was a new dimension of hunting.

26
00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:24.360
Yes, now we just gather the animals.

27
00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:28.240
Fy fuck.
 Good Job, Mr. Sniper Boss!

28
00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:32.600
- What I said about English!
 -Yes Yes.

29
00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:35.680
Good Leif!

30
00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:54.560
Thanks.

31
00:03:55.960 --> 00:04:01.080
- We will be allowed to go out tomorrow again.
 –Wa?
 Didn't it be drunk?

32
00:04:01.240 --> 00:04:06.800
Not even half full.
 Once again should be enough.

33
00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:11.120
A measured man is a happy man.

34
00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:18.560
Tappations

35
00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:18.560
Hello!

36
00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:22.840
Go you, Billy.

37
00:04:32.040 --> 00:04:34.560
Leif!

38
00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:38.360
-What is it?
 -Come here.

39
00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:46.080
He is coming soon.

40
00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:51.240
Yes ... this is my brother Leif and this is our new neighbor.

41
00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:56.800
Hey.
 Tony.
 There has been poachers in progress here all day.

42
00:04:56.960 --> 00:04:59.280
Oh, damn.

43
00:04:59.440 --> 00:05:05.440
We have found at least eight slaughter piles on the southern gravel road.
 A fucking life.

44
00:05:05.600 --> 00:05:10.240
- It was like hell.
 - Have you heard or seen anything?

45
00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:15.520
Well ... we haven't seen or heard anything.

46
00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:21.480
- We are not so much out.
 - Can you keep your eyes and ears open?

47
00:05:21.640 --> 00:05:24.880
If you hear something, you can hear from you.

48
00:05:25.040 --> 00:05:29.440
Obvious!
 We keep all channels open.

49
00:05:29.600 --> 00:05:34.720
- We do not want to have.
 - No, it's a hell.

50
00:05:34.880 --> 00:05:39.520
-Thank you then.
 Nice house.
 -Nice to meet you.

51
00:05:41.720 --> 00:05:48.160
It does not feel good!
 Imagine if he is on the tracks.
 Pigo hunting gives prison.

52
00:05:48.320 --> 00:05:54.120
Take it easy.
 What should the fourth do?
 I shit in if it's his land.

53
00:05:54.280 --> 00:05:57.920
It will be a long day tomorrow.

54
00:06:17.320 --> 00:06:20.560
Check out, Tönten and his fucking hunting team.

55
00:06:23.040 --> 00:06:29.880
"Tony, Rikard and Jonas are sure they will find the poachers."

56
00:06:30.040 --> 00:06:33.480
"The police are seriously looking at this."

57
00:06:33.640 --> 00:06:38.160
- Fuck, this doesn't feel good.
 -Take it easy.

58
00:06:38.320 --> 00:06:42.280
- But the police, Leif!
 - We have to change tactics.

59
00:06:42.440 --> 00:06:49.360
They will look here so we have to leave the car at home and hunt on foot.

60
00:06:49.520 --> 00:06:56.320
- We can end up in jail.
 - Billy!
 The freezer should be full.

61
00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:16.560
Check!

62
00:07:20.160 --> 00:07:23.280
The moose roars

63
00:07:21.720 --> 00:07:25.720
- Nice, Leffe!
 -Silent.

64
00:07:31.840 --> 00:07:37.800
- Fy, Satan, which best.
 Great!
 - Yes, but now I want to shoot more.

65
00:07:37.960 --> 00:07:42.600
Go down in the weak you, and I go over the crest.

66
00:07:42.760 --> 00:07:47.680
Shoot on everything!
 Squirrels, wild boar, crows, woodpeckers ...

67
00:07:47.840 --> 00:07:53.480
- We make mixed mince.
 --Leif, what the hell is that?

68
00:07:55.720 --> 00:08:01.400
ELTEL camera.
 The damn homophobic gay for neighbor has set it up.

69
00:08:01.560 --> 00:08:06.120
- A eel camera?
 - Yes, it's hunting fraud.

70
00:08:06.280 --> 00:08:09.400
In motion, it begins to film.

71
00:08:12.040 --> 00:08:15.200
This one, you.
 - Damn!

72
00:08:15.360 --> 00:08:21.520
- Fan, Leif, take it a little quiet!
 -Get it together.
 Now we drive, Billy!

73
00:08:21.680 --> 00:08:27.120
If you see more fucking cameras, just shrug them.

74
00:08:37.600 --> 00:08:40.760
What the hell?
 Well ...

75
00:08:44.040 --> 00:08:47.080
Here's another one!

76
00:08:47.240 --> 00:08:50.120
Here too.

77
00:08:52.080 --> 00:08:59.480
Two moose and a damn lot of small game.
 Six broken cameras ...

78
00:09:02.680 --> 00:09:06.040
What is the fucking psychopaths?

79
00:09:15.480 --> 00:09:20.400
- The last time, then we are done.
 --Leif, this is enough.

80
00:09:20.560 --> 00:09:24.760
The freezer should be full, not half full.

81
00:09:24.920 --> 00:09:29.560
We'll get up early tomorrow.
 Another moose should be enough.

82
00:09:48.320 --> 00:09:54.720
- We go down and see if we find anyone.
 -Yes.

83
00:09:54.880 --> 00:09:58.800
- Close the door, Billy!
 -Sorry.

84
00:10:09.720 --> 00:10:17.120
Have they set up one more fucking camera?
 Hörni, Stockholm Fjolornas Hunting Team!

85
00:10:17.280 --> 00:10:21.800
You can change tactics if you are to get hold of us.

86
00:10:21.960 --> 00:10:26.840
- Take off ... - it's calm.

87
00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:31.880
--Wanna fuck with the brothers of ... - take it a little quiet, Leif.

88
00:10:32.040 --> 00:10:38.040
Keep on with cameras here and there ... hunt as hunters, fucking bumps.

89
00:10:39.480 --> 00:10:42.320
I heard a bang up here.

90
00:10:42.480 --> 00:10:44.880
Satan!

91
00:10:45.040 --> 00:10:48.160
I go up and check!

92
00:10:48.960 --> 00:10:51.800
-Damn!
 -Silent.

93
00:11:07.120 --> 00:11:10.720
–O, my God.
 -I did say...

94
00:11:10.880 --> 00:11:14.800
Let me think.

95
00:11:16.680 --> 00:11:19.720
Cursed.

96
00:11:19.880 --> 00:11:22.840
We'll see who gets the last word.

97
00:11:35.360 --> 00:11:38.920
Well, now we'll see.

98
00:11:39.960 --> 00:11:46.480
One more fucking camera?
 Change tactics if you are going to get hold of us!

99
00:11:46.640 --> 00:11:52.200
I knew it!
 Now I have you, your little damn ...

100
00:11:56.160 --> 00:11:58.720
Ouch!

101
00:11:59.960 --> 00:12:04.160
What the hell are you doing?

102
00:12:23.720 --> 00:12:26.600
The memory card!

103
00:12:30.040 --> 00:12:32.880
YES!

104
00:12:33.200 --> 00:12:36.880
I have to call the police.

105
00:12:43.960 --> 00:12:49.200
Hi, it's Tony from Sörbäcken, regarding the poaching.

106
00:12:49.360 --> 00:12:54.640
It's the fucking brothers Öhman.
 They have completely checked out!

107
00:12:54.800 --> 00:13:02.360
Yes, we already have a patrol there in another case.

108
00:13:02.520 --> 00:13:08.800
Good!
 Because I have a thing here that you have to see.
 Bye!

109
00:13:11.800 --> 00:13:14.400
Hello!

110
00:13:15.320 --> 00:13:17.520
Hello.

111
00:13:17.680 --> 00:13:24.680
Your fucking madmen.
 Now you go there!
 We will look at this.
 Film.

112
00:13:24.840 --> 00:13:30.440
Throw it into the jar.
 Come on!
 They want to see.

113
00:13:32.280 --> 00:13:38.920
- We want to look at this.
 - Then we will see what you have on the card.

114
00:13:40.120 --> 00:13:43.680
Soon it will start.

115
00:13:44.760 --> 00:13:48.680
Bridges

116
00:13:51.280 --> 00:13:56.240
What the hell is this?
 There should be no moose in this clip.

117
00:13:56.400 --> 00:13:59.600
This must be wrong.

118
00:14:03.800 --> 00:14:06.920
Are you doing this?

119
00:14:07.080 --> 00:14:12.000
Oh, now it sounds like someone is a bit desperate.

120
00:14:12.160 --> 00:14:17.280
They must have replaced this in some way.

121
00:14:17.440 --> 00:14:24.440
When we still look at memory cards, the constable may want to see this.

122
00:14:24.600 --> 00:14:27.480
A very interesting clip.

123
00:14:27.640 --> 00:14:32.120
It's just a selection of what's going on here.

124
00:14:32.280 --> 00:14:38.680
We were going to go down to the party.
 We go, because we may have a beer.

125
00:14:38.840 --> 00:14:43.720
We leave the car at home, otherwise the police will come.

126
00:14:43.880 --> 00:14:49.720
-Ouch!
 What was that!
 - But check out.
 Tony!
 What are you doing?

127
00:14:49.880 --> 00:14:54.280
- You must not hunt from the kitchen?
 -What the hell?!

128
00:14:54.440 --> 00:14:59.120
- No, but I shit in!
 - a little happy ...

129
00:14:59.280 --> 00:15:05.880
- This is the sickest thing I've seen.
 - We want to look at you, Tony.

130
00:15:06.040 --> 00:15:09.160
Here is the kitchen, here is nothing.

131
00:15:09.320 --> 00:15:14.720
- Here is, like ... what is this?
 - We don't know.

132
00:15:14.880 --> 00:15:19.040
- Have you put this one?
 - Oh.

133
00:15:19.200 --> 00:15:23.760
Interesting to see what is in such a freezer.

134
00:15:23.920 --> 00:15:29.120
- Red me in the ass.
 Fuck!
 - Animal killing.

135
00:15:29.280 --> 00:15:34.960
- Come again now, guys.
 - It smells like damn.
 - It was you!

136
00:15:35.120 --> 00:15:40.280
- No, these are these guys.
 - Fuck, Tony.

137
00:15:40.440 --> 00:15:45.560
- It's enough now, Tony.
 - It's not my freezer!

138
00:15:45.720 --> 00:15:53.120
Remove the killer finger!
 Calm down!
 Remove the dirty murderer fingers.

139
00:15:53.280 --> 00:15:59.000
- He is drug -affected by marijuana!
 - Remove my fingers from me.

140
00:15:59.160 --> 00:16:02.280
He tore me on his neck.
 Blood white!

141
00:16:02.440 --> 00:16:08.320
This is how he has kept all the time, shooting and threatening people -

142
00:16:08.480 --> 00:16:15.200
–And throws at one.
 Lucky we got stuck.

143
00:16:15.360 --> 00:16:18.640
We can help you fire up the shit.

144
00:16:18.800 --> 00:16:24.400
No, this is seized.
 Can you help me carry it out to the car?

145
00:16:29.160 --> 00:16:31.680
Cursed!

146
00:16:39.360 --> 00:16:44.280
- It was the last.
 -Thanks boys.
 Bye!

147
00:16:44.440 --> 00:16:50.920
That did not go as planned.
 We may try on Andersson's lands.

148
00:16:51.080 --> 00:16:56.360
- But hell!
 - The freezer should be full.

149
00:16:56.560 --> 00:17:02.120
-Leif!
 -Come now.

150
00:17:13.240 --> 00:17:15.480
