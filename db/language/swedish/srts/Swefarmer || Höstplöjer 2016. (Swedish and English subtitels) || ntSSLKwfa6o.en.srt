1
00:00:11.740 --> 00:00:13.740
Earn on you

2
00:00:13.840 --> 00:00:15.840
Here I sit and autumn plows.

3
00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:21.580
It's been a while since I posted a video, but I've been a little sick.

4
00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:23.980
Is still a bit bad, cold.

5
00:00:26.440 --> 00:00:27.940
Here I sit and

6
00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:31.120
Autumn plows.
 Should be wheat here.

7
00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:35.120
There has been embankment here before, as you can see.

8
00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:42.200
It's dry after all

9
00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:49.060
I have had to change wear parts here on the plow.

10
00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:51.640
New cuts and lace.

11
00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:54.760
You may not see that, but it is a little green on the inserts.

12
00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:57.440
It is worn now.

13
00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:03.260
It does not cut down with the old spests and inserts, so I had to change them.

14
00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:09.020
It plows pretty well now.

15
00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:11.500
Although you see that it is dry.

16
00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:19.080
Today I sit in the MXU and plow and not in the MX.

17
00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:27.560
The MX had been more beautiful, because it has a working AC.

18
00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.000
One may take what is free

19
00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:36.260
Then you do not have to do this loader,

20
00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:38.000
On the MX as well.

21
00:01:38.980 --> 00:01:40.980
Because it is always in the way.

22
00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:46.300
Here it will be wheat as I said.

23
00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:49.200
I have plowed two more pieces as it will be wheat.

24
00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:52.140
That's the only thing we're going to be autumn this year.
 The three pieces.

25
00:01:54.280 --> 00:02:00.020
The four pieces we had with wheat and rye wheat, it will be spring grains with sowing next year

26
00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:06.980
There will be Vall in two years on them.

27
00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:16.860
It does not go very fast and

28
00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:19.120
Plow.
 You lie and

29
00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:22.200
Sneak in three km/h.

30
00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:47.200
I do not know how fun you have to sit and glare at me when I drive here and talk noise ...

31
00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:54.180
I may not have that much quality right now.
 Don't have so many new machines to show you.

32
00:02:56.480 --> 00:03:03.000
I have gone through the tractors, with buttons and that.
 I have gone through the plow twice.

33
00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:09.740
So that...

34
00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:16.840
This tractor I have nothing more to say about really.

35
00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:20.700
Clutch -free front and back.

36
00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:28.060
Have all the modern tractors, or the murders hardly have it anymore.

37
00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:38.940
This one has ordinary brakes and no abdominal brakes, or lamella connection.

38
00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:49.760
This is the loader lever.

39
00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:53.760
The lamp that shines means that the implement lock is unlocked.

40
00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:56.280
So that I can put on a scoop.

41
00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:03.500
You could say it's like an aircraft lever.

42
00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:06.840
If you pull it against you, you raise the loader and press it forward and lower the loader.

43
00:04:10.580 --> 00:04:14.980
If you pull it against you, it tilts up.

44
00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:20.040
If you push away the lever, you ted up the loader bracket.

45
00:04:21.340 --> 00:04:23.920
It's like an aircraft lever about.

46
00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:29.260
Looks pretty good, the plowing here.

47
00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:37.520
There it stretched up stone the trigger.
 Drove on a stone there.

48
00:04:40.020 --> 00:04:42.180
It was not as nicely plowed right there.

49
00:04:47.960 --> 00:04:50.500
I don't learn to finish this bit today.

50
00:04:51.080 --> 00:04:52.300
The time is

51
00:04:52.300 --> 00:04:54.260
16:31 here.

52
00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:57.000
Do not intend to drive so long tonight.

53
00:04:59.240 --> 00:05:01.460
It is not so wide, but it is long.

54
00:05:05.260 --> 00:05:09.320
There are pieces that we usually around this everything in principle.

55
00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:12.000
Right here is not ours.

56
00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:16.340
It is probably the only one in this particular thing here.

57
00:05:27.140 --> 00:05:30.360
Yes, I don't know if I should say so much more.

58
00:05:33.680 --> 00:05:36.060
I bring the camera today when I plow I thought,

59
00:05:36.060 --> 00:05:38.060
So that it becomes a movie.

60
00:05:38.540 --> 00:05:40.540
So that you do not lose interest completely

61
00:05:44.520 --> 00:05:46.520
May we see what I do next time.

62
00:05:47.980 --> 00:05:51.940
If you have any ideas, you are welcome to leave a comment.

63
00:05:53.180 --> 00:05:59.720
It can be difficult to solve certain things.
 If you may want to see specific machines, which I do not have.

64
00:06:02.440 --> 00:06:04.440
It's just asking on

65
00:06:07.240 --> 00:06:14.140
I usually say that you are happy to comment and share my videos, so more people see them.

66
00:06:14.580 --> 00:06:18.560
Subscribe and like my videos.

67
00:06:22.440 --> 00:06:24.440
If you do not like, you must make a thumb down ...

68
00:06:25.820 --> 00:06:27.120
Though I don't like it

69
00:06:28.100 --> 00:06:29.360
*Laughs*

70
00:06:32.440 --> 00:06:34.440
I just make one like this a little short video.

71
00:06:35.360 --> 00:06:38.680
I'm still sick, so I don't intend to keep talking so much

72
00:06:40.720 --> 00:06:42.720
We'll see you next time
