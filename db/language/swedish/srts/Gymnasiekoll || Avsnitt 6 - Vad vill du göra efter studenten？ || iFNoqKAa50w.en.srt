1
00:00:00,768 --> 00:00:03,560
Do you already know what you want to work on after the student?

2
00:00:03,584 --> 00:00:04,808
Or you have no idea?

3
00:00:04,988 --> 00:00:08,948
It is okay.
 I'll meet Maria and some alumni to help us with this.

4
00:00:09,088 --> 00:00:11,048
!
 I'm not going to sit here.

5
00:00:15,880 --> 00:00:18,224
What is your name and what do you work with?

6
00:00:18,380 --> 00:00:21,724
My name is Maria and I actually have two professions you can say.

7
00:00:21,780 --> 00:00:26,784
I have been my own entrepreneur and entrepreneur for 15 years, so since I really went out of high school.

8
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:32,768
Now I am in a service at an organization called Young Enterprise and works as a project manager there.

9
00:00:33,024 --> 00:00:34,816
After all, I am in second now to high school.

10
00:00:35,328 --> 00:00:37,999
And I have no control over what to do then when I take the student.

11
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:39,368
Did you have any control?

12
00:00:39,424 --> 00:00:42,752
I would say no.
 I had no control.

13
00:00:43,008 --> 00:00:45,912
But just when I got into this with the UF business last year in high school.

14
00:00:46,592 --> 00:00:49,664
Then I start to realize that this was a little fun.

15
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:54,472
And that my best qualities actually arrived.

16
00:00:54,528 --> 00:00:59,136
It was fun to go to school again and like yes but it is like in flow.

17
00:00:59,392 --> 00:01:05,068
So that my career choice came as well as I noticed what I was good at.

18
00:01:05,392 --> 00:01:10,968
And probably had extreme flow also to be thrown into it at once.

19
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,588
This with flow, what do you mean?

20
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:17,800
Flow is like when you think it's fun, things come easy for you.

21
00:01:17,824 --> 00:01:19,872
You become extra productive.

22
00:01:20,128 --> 00:01:24,424
You solve problems easier and when the body gives you signals that

23
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:26,804
"You are spot on" as well.

24
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:30,624
What's your name?

25
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:32,160
Sofia Andreasson is my name.

26
00:01:32,416 --> 00:01:33,440
What do you do for something today.

27
00:01:33,696 --> 00:01:36,512
Today I work as a doctor here in Gothenburg.

28
00:01:37,024 --> 00:01:38,048
Which program did you go?

29
00:01:38,224 --> 00:01:42,648
I went to science program at SjÃ¶lin's high school in Gothenburg.

30
00:01:42,912 --> 00:01:44,700
Would you have chosen the same program again if you had to choose?

31
00:01:44,824 --> 00:01:49,848
Yes, I had definitely done that.
 I think it was good that that program is wide

32
00:01:50,024 --> 00:01:53,548
So that there are many different choices then afterwards.

33
00:01:54,024 --> 00:01:58,348
My name is Ehsan Baqiri.
 I went to care and the care program.

34
00:01:58,528 --> 00:01:59,752
What are you working on today?

35
00:01:59,808 --> 00:02:01,856
I work with a personal assistant.

36
00:02:02,368 --> 00:02:04,672
Would you have chosen the same program if you had to choose?

37
00:02:05,184 --> 00:02:16,296
Sure, why not?
 There is some studies and a very good program.
 And you have different choices to work with after high school.

38
00:02:17,184 --> 00:02:23,596
My name is Maya.
 I went to NTI high school.
 There I read the IT and the technology program.

39
00:02:23,616 --> 00:02:25,912
Would you have chosen the same program again if you had to choose?

40
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:32,696
Yes, I had definitely done that.
 I thought it was great fun and what I work with today is also fun.

41
00:02:32,832 --> 00:02:33,856
What are you doing for something today?

42
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:38,596
Today I work at an IT company in Stockholm.
 There I sit in the finance department.

43
00:02:38,630 --> 00:02:43,696
Which I also think is fun and challenging.
 You learn new all the time.

44
00:02:44,608 --> 00:02:49,316
If you have gone your three years and still not find your flow.
 What can you think about then?

45
00:02:49,472 --> 00:02:52,544
Ask questions to yourself.
 When are you safe?

46
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:54,592
When do you feel you are good?

47
00:02:54,848 --> 00:02:55,872
When are you having fun?

48
00:02:56,128 --> 00:02:57,408
What's your favorite subject?

49
00:02:57,664 --> 00:03:01,504
Why is that?
 Are you the one who likes to work in a group or not?

50
00:03:02,016 --> 00:03:08,160
Then you can just start there fairly quickly.
 Then maybe these professions fit me a little better than these.

51
00:03:08,416 --> 00:03:10,496
Do you have any absolute last tips?

52
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:12,764
The best thing is when doing with your friends.

53
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:19,264
So one tip is to gather your buddy gang, fix a lovely dinner and put each other a little on the hot chair

54
00:03:19,284 --> 00:03:24,540
And ask these questions.
 You know a little more about each other so then maybe it will be easier to coach each other.

55
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:27,104
Thank you so much Maria for wanting to come here.

56
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:27,976
It was fun.

57
00:03:28,032 --> 00:03:31,712
Now I feel that I am very inspired to find out what I like myself.

58
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:33,248
How lovely.

59
00:03:34,272 --> 00:03:38,112
After my conversation with Mary, I feel even more that I'm in my flow.

60
00:03:38,624 --> 00:03:39,648
Hope you are too.

61
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:41,184
Yes I will go.
