1
00:00:00,400 --> 00:00:04,920
He can take over the Wagner Group after Prigozjin's death.

2
00:00:05,080 --> 00:00:08,640
And Ukrainian drone attacks deep into Russia.

3
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:12,720
New images show a rare insight into Mariupol.

4
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:16,360
What does life look like behind the Russian occupation?

5
00:00:16,520 --> 00:00:20,320
A classic trick used at Stalin era when moving whole people.

6
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:22,640
This is the war of the week -

7
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:28,480
- As every week, the latest news development in the Ukraine War deepens.

8
00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:40,760
Here, Ukrainian drones fly over the Russian city of Smolensk -

9
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:44,480
- Cirka 30 miles from the Ukrainian border.

10
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:50,560
Ukraine has recently invested in drone attacks on various goals in Russia.

11
00:00:50,720 --> 00:00:56,120
Many drones are built on your own.
 It is its own production.

12
00:00:56,280 --> 00:00:59,040
The most important thing for the allies is -

13
00:00:59,200 --> 00:01:03,320
- You don't use weapons that come from the Allies.

14
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:08,640
This is because Russia should not be able to say: "Now NATO shoots Russia."

15
00:01:08,800 --> 00:01:12,840
It could lead to an escalation in the war.

16
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:18,440
We move to the front, where there have been news in recent weeks -

17
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:22,360
- From the parts where Ukraine previously had success.

18
00:01:22,520 --> 00:01:28,040
If you zoom out, it looks like it is pretty still at the front.

19
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:32,680
At the same time, we have known that this is an offensive that will take a long time.

20
00:01:32,840 --> 00:01:35,760
It cannot be compared to previous offensives-

21
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:39,960
- There you quickly regain, for example.
 The chermen or the charkiv region.

22
00:01:40,120 --> 00:01:44,440
Here Russia has had months of preparation for themselves -

23
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:47,360
- To build up their line of defense.

24
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:49,840
Along the eastern parts of the front -

25
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:54,480
- If Russian forces have been on the offensive lately.

26
00:01:54,640 --> 00:02:00,280
SVT's team visited a mobile health center near the front during the week.

27
00:02:00,440 --> 00:02:07,800
We hear that the Russians have increased the pressure here.
 The Ukrainians are pressed over here in the east.

28
00:02:07,960 --> 00:02:12,760
But the pressure is also hard here - at the small mobile health center.

29
00:02:12,920 --> 00:02:19,400
Everything works perfectly until the Russian terror begins again.

30
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:22,920
/EXPLOSION/

31
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:32,600
New films show a rare insight from Mariupol-

32
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:36,520
–As totally destroyed by Russian forces earlier during the war -

33
00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:39,560
- And now annexed by Russia.

34
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:45,640
It is almost impossible to trust the material that comes from the Russian side.

35
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:51,080
It is selected propaganda material that is for us to get -

36
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:56,320
—The picture of a now flourishing city that is being rebuilt -

37
00:02:56,480 --> 00:03:01,760
- And where all the inhabitants are happy with life - especially life in Russia.

38
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:08,760
Of course, we have started working according to Russian norms, and adopted Russian law.

39
00:03:08,920 --> 00:03:11,920
Now everything is completely different.

40
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:15,960
The pictures see lots of newly built residential areas -

41
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:18,760
- But also several bombed houses.

42
00:03:18,920 --> 00:03:21,800
And everywhere, Russian flags hang.

43
00:03:21,960 --> 00:03:27,280
An important thing that is forgotten is that the city is actually almost emptied of its residents.

44
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:33,000
It is said that 350,000 people have left the city of just under 0.5 million.

45
00:03:33,160 --> 00:03:37,720
Instead, people have been moved in.
 You make population movements in Russia.

46
00:03:37,880 --> 00:03:41,880
It is an old trick where you move people from other parts of Russia -

47
00:03:42,040 --> 00:03:44,600
–And this way, the city splits.

48
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:48,680
A classic trick used at Stalin era when moving whole people.

49
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:53,840
Much of what is going on in the occupied areas -

50
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:57,360
- Remember about the great terror during the staline period.

51
00:03:57,520 --> 00:04:02,640
Both in the way you interrogate and execute dissent -

52
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:05,680
- But also the big population movements.

53
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:11,720
The reason why the films from Mariupol were released right now is no coincidence.

54
00:04:11,880 --> 00:04:15,400
The material was published on September 30 -

55
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:20,240
- On the anniversary of the illegal annexation of the Ukrainian regions -

56
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:24,760
- Luhansk, Donetsk, Zaporizjzja and Chenler.

57
00:04:24,920 --> 00:04:27,920
This is what it looked like in Moscow the same day -

58
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:32,880
—When the anniversary, which in Russia is now referred to as the reunification day -

59
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:35,360
- Fired with pomp and standing.

60
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:39,800
It is symbolically important.
 It is a way to show that you have had success in the war.

61
00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:44,920
The whole war has been bought about -

62
00:04:45,080 --> 00:04:50,080
—To one should liberate the Russian -speaking population of Ukraine -

63
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:56,640
- From "The Nazi rule", which is called Zelenskyj and his government.

64
00:04:56,800 --> 00:05:01,040
This will be a clear picture that you want to show -

65
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:06,680
— That you celebrate in these "reunited cities", as one calls them -

66
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:11,960
- To show that people are satisfied and that they have succeeded in the war.

67
00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:20,400
When the Proske Robert Fico proclaimed victorious in Slovakia's Val-

68
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:23,160
- Ringed the alarm bells in Brussels.

69
00:05:23,320 --> 00:05:28,040
During the election, Fico has promised to strangle the support for Ukraine -

70
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:30,880
- And improve relationships with Russia.

71
00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:36,840
Much indicates that Russia has affected the election and worked hard for it.

72
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:42,080
Several analysts have highlighted that the hard tone from Slovakia -

73
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:45,080
- Not so much for Ukraine.

74
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:49,480
I do not think so.
 There is probably a deep unity political -

75
00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:54,400
—That you have to resist Russia and support Ukraine -

76
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:59,040
- For the war not to expand and also affect their own countries.

77
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:05,280
However, I believe that dissatisfaction can lead to an increased split -

78
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:09,600
- A polarization in these countries, especially in Eastern Europe.

79
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:17,280
Ukrainian politicians have collapsed after Elon Musk published this meme.

80
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:21,920
President Zelenskyj's head has been cut together with the text:

81
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:26,680
"When five minutes have passed and you have not asked for a billion dollars in support."

82
00:06:26,840 --> 00:06:31,240
An image previously shared by several Prorey accounts.

83
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:34,160
Musk has suddenly been given a big role.

84
00:06:34,320 --> 00:06:40,760
Partly when it came to the fact that he had affected the attack against Crimea last year

85
00:06:40,920 --> 00:06:43,520
- What made the Ukrainians furious.

86
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:50,600
And now that he is sending out this type of message on X, f.d.
 Twitter-

87
00:06:50,760 --> 00:06:58,040
- They get a huge spread.
 Musk has almost 160 million followers.

88
00:06:58,200 --> 00:07:03,400
Compared to a Russian troll, he reaches out to many more.

89
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:09,240
If he then chooses a Prorean rhetoric, it can have enormous consequences.

90
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:14,440
Late Wagnergruppen's rebellion in June and after the leader Prigozjin's death -

91
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:17,800
- If the Wagner Group's future has been unclear.

92
00:07:17,960 --> 00:07:21,000
But now more and more tasks are spreading that means -

93
00:07:21,160 --> 00:07:26,600
- That Prigozjin's son, Pavel Prigozjin, must have taken command of the group.

94
00:07:26,760 --> 00:07:31,720
25-year-old Pavel has lived a secret-full life in the shadow of his father-

95
00:07:31,880 --> 00:07:35,640
- And there are therefore almost no public pictures of him.

96
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:38,880
The challenges for Pavel Prigozjin are several.

97
00:07:39,040 --> 00:07:43,840
On the one hand, the Kremlin must accept him as a leader -

98
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:48,360
–And here you have clearly shown that you would prefer that Wagner enters -

99
00:07:48,520 --> 00:07:54,080
- In the regular Russian troops and is not left as a private army.

100
00:07:54,240 --> 00:08:00,880
Then Pavel Prigozjin must also be accepted by the Wagner Soldiers -

101
00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:05,560
- That has been very loyal to his father Jevgenij.

102
00:08:05,720 --> 00:08:12,360
They are called the "chefs".
 A strong authority is required from Pavel's side -

103
00:08:12,520 --> 00:08:15,520
- To be able to take over the role after his father.

104
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:18,680
