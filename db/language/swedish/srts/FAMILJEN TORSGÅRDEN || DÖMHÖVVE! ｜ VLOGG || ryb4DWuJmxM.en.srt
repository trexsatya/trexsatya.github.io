1
00:00:27.678 --> 00:00:29.369
Good morning

2
00:00:40.627 --> 00:00:42.974
Oh, were you there, you should we pull?

3
00:00:42.974 --> 00:00:45.437
Good morning, welcome back to a new vlog, it's Monday.

4
00:00:45.437 --> 00:00:48.904
It is 9:30.

5
00:00:49.344 --> 00:00:51.691
I just left Selma at preschool.

6
00:00:51.933 --> 00:00:55.823
Svea is home because she was a bit snotty last week.

7
00:00:55.823 --> 00:01:00.743
If you have symptoms longer than 24 hours, you should be home for 7 days.

8
00:01:00.743 --> 00:01:04.612
Think Svea was a bit snotty for 30 hours, or something.

9
00:01:05.691 --> 00:01:06.512
She must be home.

10
00:01:06.512 --> 00:01:11.668
Selma we also thought of having at home, but she very much wanted to preschool today.

11
00:01:14.628 --> 00:01:16.705
She may be there for a few hours anyway.

12
00:01:17.245 --> 00:01:20.595
Can be good to hurt them sometimes too, they really need home time.

13
00:01:34.864 --> 00:01:39.912
I don't know why I'm in such a bad mood today.

14
00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:47.827
First we sleep and then I get stressed.

15
00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.960
I usually get a little angry when I'm stressed.

16
00:01:51.648 --> 00:02:01.364
Then I think the children got angry that we were sleeping, they have not been in a good mood.

17
00:02:02.548 --> 00:02:03.970
No, okay ...

18
00:02:04.355 --> 00:02:05.584
You are happy now anyway

19
00:02:06.386 --> 00:02:07.499
Good

20
00:02:07.904 --> 00:02:10.483
Elsa is a bit grumpy today too.

21
00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.452
I'm just trying to turn on the day now.

22
00:02:14.452 --> 00:02:19.031
Today is such a day as I feel I just want to sit at home

23
00:02:19.262 --> 00:02:23.472
Sit on the couch and scroll on the phone.

24
00:02:25.543 --> 00:02:28.392
But we shouldn't do that yet!

25
00:02:32.365 --> 00:02:34.365
Yeah, we'll have a coffee

26
00:02:34.365 --> 00:02:37.445
I haven't had breakfast today, or I actually forgot about it.

27
00:02:40.936 --> 00:02:43.982
Me, Svea and Elsa are going to Sunne now.

28
00:02:44.757 --> 00:02:50.546
Still, we can't be at home, for Oskar to insert the last window.

29
00:02:51.703 --> 00:02:57.058
Last week we started with it in the vlog and since then we have not been able to move on with it.

30
00:02:57.058 --> 00:03:02.530
We have had a hole in the wall for a week because I have worked

31
00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:08.252
Oskar has been with the children who have been home and been "sick".

32
00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:13.417
So it has not become anything more, so now he will try to grab it.

33
00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:16.817
We leave the house.

34
00:03:18.283 --> 00:03:19.782
Going to Sunne.

35
00:03:25.697 --> 00:03:27.311
Svea

36
00:04:14.389 --> 00:04:19.360
Svea: She looks at me -aTtars Elsa at you?

37
00:04:19.360 --> 00:04:21.398
Yeah!
 -Yes, she's looking at you!

38
00:04:25.196 --> 00:04:27.196
Now we run

39
00:04:32.388 --> 00:04:34.157
Spring Elsa

40
00:04:56.015 --> 00:04:57.359
Svea

41
00:05:03.517 --> 00:05:05.460
Svea: Little sister.

42
00:05:05.460 --> 00:05:08.115
Is little sister better why then?

43
00:05:08.115 --> 00:05:13.201
Svea: Because she's very cute of them?

44
00:05:15.308 --> 00:05:18.000
She eats milk

45
00:05:19.003 --> 00:05:20.501
Do you mean Elsa

46
00:05:25.527 --> 00:05:27.581
Dad smells ...

47
00:05:28.932 --> 00:05:30.576
...toothpaste

48
00:05:30.576 --> 00:05:33.011
Well, but it was better than fish sticks anyway.

49
00:05:35.081 --> 00:05:36.626
Aa, are you

50
00:05:36.626 --> 00:05:37.931
Mmm

51
00:05:42.790 --> 00:05:45.994
Ugh, what a weather it was, I was going to plant today.

52
00:05:45.994 --> 00:05:52.238
Thought I would prepare a little nice on the porch, with the flowers I bought.

53
00:06:00.340 --> 00:06:03.960
Then we go and pick up Selma, in the rainy weather.

54
00:06:13.549 --> 00:06:15.318
I have a question for you, Selma.

55
00:06:17.553 --> 00:06:18.936
Selma: Why that

56
00:06:26.739 --> 00:06:28.353
Selma: I don't know.

57
00:06:28.932 --> 00:06:30.571
Nothing?
 -Nää.

58
00:06:30.571 --> 00:06:32.200
Am I not good at anything?
 -Joo!

59
00:06:32.200 --> 00:06:33.968
What am I good at then?
 -I do not know.

60
00:06:33.968 --> 00:06:35.968
What do you think I'm good at

61
00:06:37.416 --> 00:06:38.914
Selma: A Pepsi

62
00:06:40.107 --> 00:06:41.490
Bake.

63
00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:45.931
Selma: These monks that were Greta pig.

64
00:06:45.931 --> 00:06:47.777
Well, though I had bought them.

65
00:06:49.906 --> 00:06:51.906
What do you think dad is good at, then

66
00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:55.531
Cook.

67
00:06:56.190 --> 00:06:57.920
Huh okay ...

68
00:06:58.896 --> 00:07:00.819
Is he better at cooking than me

69
00:07:01.926 --> 00:07:02.961
Yes

70
00:07:03.532 --> 00:07:06.496
Just because you always get meatballs and macaroni when making food

71
00:07:11.600 --> 00:07:13.098
Woho

72
00:07:20.114 --> 00:07:22.654
Svea: I want her to sit on my back

73
00:07:26.807 --> 00:07:28.035
Oh

74
00:07:28.228 --> 00:07:30.000
You must not go away, Svea.

75
00:07:30.737 --> 00:07:33.354
Selma: a snail that takes me

76
00:07:36.906 --> 00:07:38.135
Are you also a snail now

77
00:07:38.135 --> 00:07:43.182
Selma: Now I'm a human being anyway.
 Well, you are a snail, jump down on the floor and be a snail.

78
00:08:00.522 --> 00:08:02.985
God, what a tough day we have at home today.

79
00:08:03.539 --> 00:08:10.979
I get a little stressed, but I try not to be it and be able to take these days more often.

80
00:08:10.979 --> 00:08:14.993
So damn nice anyway not to do so much.

81
00:08:15.495 --> 00:08:17.264
Which we have not done today.

82
00:08:17.681 --> 00:08:21.340
Selma and Svea watch some TV, eat some fruit.

83
00:08:21.763 --> 00:08:24.540
Elsa and I have slept on the couch.

84
00:08:24.887 --> 00:08:26.578
It was also great.

85
00:08:26.578 --> 00:08:31.857
I've been so tired, feels like I could sleep every day now.

86
00:08:32.842 --> 00:08:38.739
Think that is because I have pretty bad blood values right now.
 I was with the midwife 1.5 weeks ago.

87
00:08:42.655 --> 00:08:50.327
I took blood tests and then she said that the limit on these values is 117 and I had 115.

88
00:08:50.674 --> 00:08:55.043
So i'm going to eat on with food and keep eating iron tablets

89
00:08:55.043 --> 00:08:58.090
And then I would come back after a week and take a new blood test-

90
00:08:58.090 --> 00:09:01.157
And make sure it goes in the right direction.

91
00:09:02.199 --> 00:09:06.436
I think that's why I'm tired and energyless.

92
00:09:08.978 --> 00:09:11.711
We have to take some dinner.

93
00:09:13.506 --> 00:09:17.589
Thought I should take and clean the hall.

94
00:09:18.424 --> 00:09:20.270
What is the matter with you then, Elsa

95
00:09:20.733 --> 00:09:22.337
Have you woken up now

96
00:09:24.656 --> 00:09:26.656
The name, the name

97
00:09:26.904 --> 00:09:29.830
Oops you lie here and box in the air

98
00:09:34.693 --> 00:09:36.462
Mmm, good.

99
00:09:36.693 --> 00:09:38.324
Lose the pacifier.

100
00:09:41.846 --> 00:09:43.576
Good you are.

101
00:09:46.879 --> 00:09:48.879
We're going to make dinner.

102
00:09:50.366 --> 00:09:55.761
We have some cheeses left from the weekend.

103
00:09:58.513 --> 00:10:00.513
Goat cheese, blue cheese.

104
00:10:03.145 --> 00:10:07.460
Maybe cheese paste with walnuts maybe.

105
00:10:27.812 --> 00:10:35.137
It became cream, blue cheese, leaf spinach, salt, white wine, walnuts.

106
00:10:37.005 --> 00:10:38.774
My God, what a luxury.

107
00:10:39.286 --> 00:10:44.990
Selma: If you were spilled, then you would have had to dry up ...

108
00:10:54.309 --> 00:10:56.039
Oskar: I don't know.

109
00:10:56.911 --> 00:10:58.602
Oskar: Maybe.

110
00:10:58.602 --> 00:11:00.602
About how long then in that case

111
00:11:01.902 --> 00:11:04.481
Oskar: Was it a follow -up question or did you continue the question

112
00:11:05.145 --> 00:11:08.765
Oskar: Or is it you who asked the question -I was the one who continued the question.

113
00:11:08.765 --> 00:11:10.765
You are so curious you

114
00:11:11.062 --> 00:11:12.676
Near

115
00:11:19.922 --> 00:11:21.067
Oskar: Not in a hurry at all.

116
00:11:21.067 --> 00:11:25.780
Well, maybe you will start to wonder in three years.

117
00:11:26.596 --> 00:11:28.133
Or?
 -Yes.

118
00:11:28.133 --> 00:11:31.985
Then you get to know, in several years.

119
00:11:34.553 --> 00:11:37.865
Crafts, carpenter or mason.

120
00:11:38.246 --> 00:11:40.246
Is it the dream profession

121
00:11:41.592 --> 00:11:44.132
Yes I think so.
 -Not blacksmith, or anything?

122
00:11:44.132 --> 00:11:49.488
Yes, it would have been fun.
 Imagine forging full time, to feed on it.

123
00:11:49.488 --> 00:11:50.761
It would have been fun.

124
00:11:51.527 --> 00:11:53.527
Or type ... -... Youtuber?

125
00:11:55.071 --> 00:11:57.264
Or small farmer.

126
00:11:58.359 --> 00:12:07.534
Get some cows and grow a little bit of everything possible, sold a little.

127
00:12:08.841 --> 00:12:12.847
If there was an economy in such things, I would have easily tinkering with it.

128
00:12:13.142 --> 00:12:14.640
bye

129
00:12:15.064 --> 00:12:16.544
Hello then, Elsa

130
00:12:24.810 --> 00:12:28.662
It is so bright outside, can't believe it is 20:30.

131
00:12:30.424 --> 00:12:32.038
The children sleep.

132
00:12:33.081 --> 00:12:38.823
Oskar just went away and should watch football, he brought Elsa with him.

133
00:12:39.744 --> 00:12:41.744
So now I have some home time.

134
00:12:43.122 --> 00:12:48.980
Now I'm going to take and clean the hall.

135
00:12:49.250 --> 00:12:51.327
And insert new boxes.

136
00:12:51.327 --> 00:12:55.873
After I have taken the dishes and removed a little neighbor.

137
00:13:24.853 --> 00:13:26.853
I'll take and clean our hall.

138
00:13:27.171 --> 00:13:28.978
This is what it looks like right now.

139
00:13:29.273 --> 00:13:37.484
I will ... maybe not today when I have to screw, do not want to risk the children wake up now at 21.

140
00:13:39.730 --> 00:13:44.855
We have this one that we have put together, with boxes.

141
00:13:45.075 --> 00:13:50.470
They are already smoking.
 Should clear from winter stuff, hats.

142
00:13:51.440 --> 00:13:59.769
Put down swimwear, bathing rings and all that it may be.
 Sun creams.

143
00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:02.270
Clean through this cabinet.

144
00:14:02.936 --> 00:14:06.247
We have bought new boxes.

145
00:14:06.609 --> 00:14:11.446
When I ordered these I ordered the wrong boxes, or we got wrong, I don't know.

146
00:14:11.677 --> 00:14:13.894
Probably it was me who ordered wrong.

147
00:14:16.262 --> 00:14:20.654
The boxes we have are not as deep as you see.

148
00:14:20.964 --> 00:14:25.695
They continue in a little bit more, the ones I have happened to buy are type 30 deep

149
00:14:25.695 --> 00:14:29.769
And we have room for 50 deep.

150
00:14:30.171 --> 00:14:35.258
This means that we have room for much more and we need it in this hall.

151
00:14:35.258 --> 00:14:39.709
I'll replace them so we get deeper boxes.

152
00:14:39.924 --> 00:14:43.119
I'll clear there and clear a little here.

153
00:14:44.393 --> 00:14:46.393
Clean a little, dry a little.

154
00:14:46.547 --> 00:14:51.056
Listen to a pod.
 I love this, listen to pod and pill with things.

155
00:14:51.056 --> 00:14:52.863
Clean a box.

156
00:14:53.576 --> 00:14:56.155
It is soothing for my soul.

157
00:15:43.156 --> 00:15:44.654
Finished

158
00:15:45.181 --> 00:15:47.760
So nice, now it feels like new again.

159
00:16:09.573 --> 00:16:11.149
Does it go well for you

160
00:16:13.807 --> 00:16:18.778
After leaving the dining table for three minutes to take care of Elsa ...

161
00:16:22.758 --> 00:16:24.231
Good morning.

162
00:16:25.063 --> 00:16:30.000
I try to hide that I am and look like a zombie today.

163
00:16:30.739 --> 00:16:32.273
I'm so tired.

164
00:16:33.045 --> 00:16:36.983
Oskar and I fell asleep around 00:30 yesterday, watched a movie in bed.

165
00:16:38.394 --> 00:16:40.201
The children went up 5:30.

166
00:16:40.478 --> 00:16:43.095
They were so nice then, so it was just to get up.

167
00:16:43.095 --> 00:16:44.671
I'm so tired

168
00:16:44.985 --> 00:16:48.605
Now we are going out and taking care of the animals, it blows so much today.

169
00:16:48.892 --> 00:16:51.240
So it will not be possible to film anything outside, I think.

170
00:16:52.394 --> 00:16:55.281
Our animals were castrated last week.

171
00:16:57.616 --> 00:17:01.584
So we are going to take care of them a little neighbor, look so they feel good.

172
00:17:03.145 --> 00:17:06.000
Wonder if it's time for them to move out now with the others.

173
00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:25.768
Hello the animals

174
00:17:26.018 --> 00:17:27.246
Hi

175
00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:32.000
How are things going with the pungs

176
00:17:36.947 --> 00:17:38.523
What good you are

177
00:17:39.729 --> 00:17:41.729
Oskar: Do you grab the horns Svea: Aaa!

178
00:17:43.344 --> 00:17:45.074
Oskar: Take hold, do not release.

179
00:17:45.074 --> 00:17:46.302
Hold hard.

180
00:17:48.979 --> 00:17:50.670
Oskar: Try Staffan.

181
00:17:53.061 --> 00:17:54.990
Good Svea, hold on hard.

182
00:17:55.301 --> 00:17:57.147
Oskar: Just right, good svea

183
00:17:58.281 --> 00:17:59.702
Oskar: A horn in each hand.

184
00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:01.576
Take the other hand there.

185
00:18:01.786 --> 00:18:03.979
So Dad can spray in the back.

186
00:18:05.135 --> 00:18:06.363
Svea: Good

187
00:18:08.857 --> 00:18:10.626
Oskar: Hold on.

188
00:18:11.167 --> 00:18:12.000
Oskar: Now you are strong

189
00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:13.345
Svea: Staffan Oskar: That is Bengt.

190
00:18:13.345 --> 00:18:14.805
Svea: Staffan

191
00:18:15.689 --> 00:18:21.045
We have, as I said, castrated the goat boys.

192
00:18:25.147 --> 00:18:29.038
We got a honey spray to spray.

193
00:18:31.588 --> 00:18:33.974
Now they will finally be allowed to go out after a week.

194
00:18:35.383 --> 00:18:38.698
Oskar: Go behind and scrap them out.

195
00:18:38.698 --> 00:18:40.698
Svea: Schas, Schas

196
00:18:41.719 --> 00:18:43.719
Good, svea, more

197
00:18:43.889 --> 00:18:46.159
Schas, Schas

198
00:18:49.692 --> 00:18:51.846
Out with you, there is food out there.

199
00:19:15.445 --> 00:19:19.027
Elsa is lying inside and sleeping, so we should take the opportunity to cup the potato land.

200
00:19:20.741 --> 00:19:24.284
So that the weeds stay away from our potatoes.

201
00:20:03.254 --> 00:20:06.974
We'll have lunch, will be the same as yesterday

202
00:20:06.974 --> 00:20:13.606
pita bread with salad, feta cheese, tomato, red onion, cucumber-

203
00:20:13.606 --> 00:20:18.256
And a quinoa and sweet potato steak.

204
00:20:20.534 --> 00:20:21.724
Yes

205
00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:31.537
Svea: Oh, my shoe

206
00:20:45.145 --> 00:20:49.537
This vlog is so damn messy, I understand it, we have no plans today

207
00:20:49.537 --> 00:20:52.888
Otherwise it is "Today we will do this and this."

208
00:20:53.474 --> 00:20:58.097
Right now we just go around, we see something that needs to be done and we will.

209
00:20:58.775 --> 00:21:03.125
I have revealed all the outdoor furniture again because now it will not be sunny I was about to say

210
00:21:03.125 --> 00:21:07.797
Now it should not be rain in a few days.

211
00:21:10.889 --> 00:21:15.358
Wondering if I should pick some dandelions.

212
00:21:16.168 --> 00:21:17.744
A little weed.

213
00:21:18.686 --> 00:21:24.000
Oskar is stopping the last windows.

214
00:21:24.000 --> 00:21:29.087
Elsa sleeps again, we have been inside and cooked lunch, mysterious for a while.

215
00:21:29.615 --> 00:21:31.924
I wonder if I should change water in the pool as well.

216
00:21:32.081 --> 00:21:37.090
Yes, you see, I come up with new information all the time.

217
00:21:38.097 --> 00:21:39.480
There is much to do here.

218
00:21:40.940 --> 00:21:42.940
Oh, my poor flowers.

219
00:21:49.808 --> 00:21:57.710
We have a box in front of the basement, where I thought to put those tall flowers.

220
00:21:57.979 --> 00:21:59.362
And they a little lower.

221
00:22:00.730 --> 00:22:04.891
Then of course I bought Rosenskär, although I found yellow.

222
00:22:04.891 --> 00:22:09.476
I think whites are by far the finest, but the yellow ones were also fine.

223
00:22:09.476 --> 00:22:11.437
I bought them for another pot.

224
00:22:50.867 --> 00:22:54.641
The idea is that this will be a big bush sometime, an oxygen hydrangea.

225
00:22:54.641 --> 00:22:58.386
It should be huge and bushy I had thought.

226
00:22:59.159 --> 00:23:04.747
Around the entrance here, but it didn't turn out so well.
 It's not going so fast.

227
00:23:05.081 --> 00:23:11.594
Don't know if I said it in the last vlog, but the goats cooked up our plants.

228
00:23:11.594 --> 00:23:16.063
And the hens sand baths so that the soil disappears.

229
00:23:17.145 --> 00:23:19.454
Therefore, our plants do not feel so good.

230
00:23:33.240 --> 00:23:36.976
Nämen, a white rose -cut in the middle of everything comes up as well.

231
00:23:38.484 --> 00:23:41.024
A little finer outside the guest house.

232
00:23:42.000 --> 00:23:44.154
If the bushes go sometime, then, damn ...

233
00:24:07.391 --> 00:24:08.890
Will go and pick up Selma.

234
00:24:09.083 --> 00:24:17.383
As yesterday she was at preschool, she has been there for a few hours today too.

235
00:24:20.366 --> 00:24:21.706
You, you

236
00:24:21.938 --> 00:24:26.733
Should we take and buy an ice cream?
 -Yeah!

237
00:24:26.733 --> 00:24:28.964
We cheat today, it's only Tuesday.

238
00:24:29.546 --> 00:24:31.546
You want it, Svea gets the same.

239
00:24:39.321 --> 00:24:41.321
Check out what just came with the post.

240
00:24:41.321 --> 00:24:44.903
New lane to the chickens.

241
00:24:45.399 --> 00:24:48.154
Now Oskar will clean them up and pick them up.

242
00:24:48.154 --> 00:24:49.807
Or we should build them together.

243
00:24:50.034 --> 00:24:54.079
Don't know if you hear me now, this has been a problem because we have been out all day

244
00:24:54.079 --> 00:24:57.622
And it has blown like seventeen, I haven't been able to talk.

245
00:25:00.000 --> 00:25:06.562
I have been allowed to wait for the wind, now it has calmed down, now it does not blow as much.

246
00:25:07.967 --> 00:25:11.124
"Okay, now nothing is blowing" and so I've talked and then it starts to blow.

247
00:25:12.000 --> 00:25:15.101
This whole vlog has been fast forward largely.

248
00:25:15.101 --> 00:25:18.000
I may well call it the fast flush vlog.

249
00:25:18.682 --> 00:25:23.461
There are many who like those sequences in my videos.

250
00:25:24.574 --> 00:25:26.381
This is a vlog for you

251
00:25:28.232 --> 00:25:30.232
Should you get it tidy and nice now

252
00:25:30.999 --> 00:25:32.806
New lane.

253
00:25:33.917 --> 00:25:35.917
You have shit down so damn.

254
00:25:36.630 --> 00:25:40.597
We have had problems with chicken mites.

255
00:25:41.270 --> 00:25:45.430
But we bought some type of killer malway.

256
00:25:46.957 --> 00:25:52.352
I don't know what it is called, but a mite that eats up such mites.

257
00:25:53.085 --> 00:25:58.772
You buy them in a pipe, release them in the chicken house, they eat up these mites

258
00:25:59.846 --> 00:26:03.334
And when the food ends, ie the mite, they also die.

259
00:26:03.334 --> 00:26:06.328
Or they die when it gets too cold.

260
00:26:06.714 --> 00:26:08.714
So then they also disappear, finally.

261
00:26:24.501 --> 00:26:26.347
She refuses to leave

262
00:26:30.000 --> 00:26:34.237
She just "nah, i'm not going to leave my eggs"

263
00:26:34.948 --> 00:26:36.485
So damn scary when they ...

264
00:26:37.495 --> 00:26:41.089
Oskar: It doesn't hurt, but it's nasty ... she never knows when I come so just:

265
00:26:41.089 --> 00:26:42.819
Can't you try, then

266
00:26:52.707 --> 00:26:53.704
So

267
00:27:03.708 --> 00:27:05.052
bye

268
00:27:07.675 --> 00:27:10.511
It is also for one to be able to

269
00:27:12.000 --> 00:27:16.384
Pick out the preparation and clean it easier.

270
00:27:17.059 --> 00:27:19.483
The others are in wood and stuck to the wall.

271
00:27:22.645 --> 00:27:24.645
Selma: Klara, finished, go

272
00:27:25.616 --> 00:27:26.883
Selma: I will win

273
00:27:28.052 --> 00:27:29.782
Selma: Yeah, I won

274
00:27:29.782 --> 00:27:32.052
Svea: I won Selma: Nah !!

275
00:27:35.509 --> 00:27:37.200
Are you drunk

276
00:27:55.281 --> 00:28:01.486
I might have this to you then, because I have just done wrong

277
00:28:02.370 --> 00:28:03.714
Oskar: Maybe it's just as good.

278
00:28:03.714 --> 00:28:05.289
I have built together and Oskar redesigns.

279
00:28:08.720 --> 00:28:17.626
I just told Oskar that the top of the most boring thing is to go to the dump, order.

280
00:28:19.486 --> 00:28:21.139
Throw glass and metal.

281
00:28:21.548 --> 00:28:26.209
But this fuck everything, build something together, make mistakes and can rebuild it again.

282
00:28:27.541 --> 00:28:29.117
Right?
 -Mmm.

283
00:28:30.193 --> 00:28:33.510
What a lucky thing I came here now and did not have to join in and build the wrong

284
00:28:33.510 --> 00:28:34.363
Just

285
00:28:34.363 --> 00:28:36.787
Now I have the energy to do this.
 -Yes exactly!

286
00:28:47.267 --> 00:28:49.267
Tacoti day

287
00:28:49.731 --> 00:28:51.731
Selma: Näee -nähä?

288
00:28:52.656 --> 00:28:54.386
Selma: I want sausage.

289
00:28:55.003 --> 00:28:56.849
Now it's tacos.

290
00:28:57.042 --> 00:28:58.426
It's even better.

291
00:29:28.177 --> 00:29:29.073
Hello!

292
00:29:30.193 --> 00:29:31.918
Do you chew up my spices

293
00:29:32.304 --> 00:29:33.880
Buttons

294
00:30:00.694 --> 00:30:01.922
So there

295
00:30:20.735 --> 00:30:22.735
Have you lay down in there again!

296
00:30:22.735 --> 00:30:24.000
Little hen.

297
00:30:24.000 --> 00:30:25.691
She has been in the box again.

298
00:30:34.474 --> 00:30:35.664
Ah

299
00:30:36.519 --> 00:30:42.763
Thought I would do a little thing to the hens now that it is so hot outside.

300
00:30:42.763 --> 00:30:50.241
One thing that can make them cool off a bit was actually one of you who wrote and advised me about this.

301
00:30:50.241 --> 00:30:52.048
You should have a swap.

302
00:30:54.000 --> 00:30:55.151
Maize.

303
00:30:56.631 --> 00:31:04.552
And water.
 You freeze it, the ice block puts with corn in when it is hot outside

304
00:31:04.552 --> 00:31:08.667
Then they get some cold water.

305
00:31:15.038 --> 00:31:17.038
A little ice cream.

306
00:31:27.100 --> 00:31:31.106
The children are sleeping now, or they have done it for a while, it is 21:15.

307
00:31:33.995 --> 00:31:41.015
I am damn tired today, but I think we should replace the boxes, that has been my goal today.

308
00:31:59.663 --> 00:32:02.627
It is already 23:20, I sit and do the last job.

309
00:32:03.097 --> 00:32:06.424
Right now, you are responding to your comments on the last video.

310
00:32:06.887 --> 00:32:13.132
Something that I think is so much fun is when you time tags things in the video that you thought were extra fun.

311
00:32:13.903 --> 00:32:17.132
Something that you like a little extra, like this one to show an example.

312
00:32:17.132 --> 00:32:21.639
Here Susanna has written "Hahaha, love".
 21:05.

313
00:32:21.811 --> 00:32:24.274
Then I can click there and get right there.

314
00:32:24.274 --> 00:32:27.688
"Selma is so grumpy" "she thinks you are grumpy today too"

315
00:32:27.997 --> 00:32:30.000
"She's so grumpy"

316
00:32:30.000 --> 00:32:31.971
"You with" "Näe"

317
00:32:32.434 --> 00:32:38.678
Many people have been tagged just that sequence when Svea heavens with their eyes.

318
00:32:39.115 --> 00:32:41.424
And thinks Selma is grumpy.

319
00:32:42.727 --> 00:32:49.627
So I think that is great fun, also think it is great fun when you write what you thought was interesting and good in the video.

320
00:32:50.401 --> 00:32:55.757
That's how I can design my vlogs and develop more of what you like.

321
00:32:57.041 --> 00:33:00.000
Feel free to write what you thought was good, fun or interesting.

322
00:33:00.000 --> 00:33:02.424
Or whatever you want more of.

323
00:33:03.640 --> 00:33:06.193
So they became more as you want them.

324
00:33:06.193 --> 00:33:12.231
Of course, I do not change my everyday life, but I may be able to get more fast flush if you like it.

325
00:33:12.231 --> 00:33:17.698
Or more question time or more that I sit and talk, yes you take.

326
00:33:18.796 --> 00:33:20.487
Now I'm going to make this clear.

327
00:33:20.796 --> 00:33:23.259
And then I'll go to sleep, now I'm very tired.

328
00:33:23.259 --> 00:33:26.918
Yesterday was very tough, the day today has been better.

329
00:33:28.125 --> 00:33:30.279
Now it feels good.

330
00:33:30.751 --> 00:33:33.368
Thank you for looking, good night, see you soon

331
00:33:33.368 --> 00:33:34.326
Kiss puss, hi hi
