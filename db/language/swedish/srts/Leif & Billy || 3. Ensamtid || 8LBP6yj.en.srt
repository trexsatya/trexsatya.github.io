1
00:00:07.840 --> 00:00:10.240
Billy!

2
00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:13.640
Billy, step up now!

3
00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:18.400
- Claim up!
 - Take it quiet, Leif.

4
00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:23.520
- Why don't you step up?
 - I wanted to pull me for a while.

5
00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:29.680
Lying and pulling, it's great ... what do you have under the blanket?

6
00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:35.280
- Is it a beer?
 -No.

7
00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:40.760
- You don't lie and drink beer?
 - Yeah, Satan!

8
00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:45.360
There is no beer!
 Stop it.
 Ouch.

9
00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:50.840
Fy fuck.

10
00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:58.600
Snuffpelle.
 Go and wash.
 You should be at work in a quarter.

11
00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:06.280
Yuk.

12
00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:16.480
Well ... do you have a cup of coffee?

13
00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:20.040
Not as you have been lying and filming you.

14
00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:24.160
It was a regular morning stand.

15
00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:28.720
I shit in if it was a sunbathing.

16
00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:34.240
You should work, but lie and pill on yourself.
 Where is the work ethic?

17
00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:37.400
Why do I have to take the piss job?

18
00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:42.640
If I didn't fix the house, it wouldn't be another day.

19
00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:49.840
Roof tiles should be replaced, the elements knock, and the A-box is soon over.

20
00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:57.400
Come now.

21
00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:10.560
So, drive now.

22
00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:13.760
Cursed ... Sew.

23
00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:17.760
-Out.
 -Okay.

24
00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:20.920
I'll pick you up later.

25
00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:33.040
Salad, tomato, onion, feferoni.

26
00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:38.240
When the customer says "everything on", you take everything.

27
00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:44.640
Hi, Billy.
 This is Jerker.
 He is responsible for the pizza salad.

28
00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:48.680
And you should fold these.

29
00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:53.480
Fold 500 pieces.
 There are more in the warehouse.

30
00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:57.680
Jerker, I'll show you how to make sauce.

31
00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:10.920
Alone time ... what to find?

32
00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:16.400
Maybe the old man wants to find something.

33
00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:31.920
Well, welcome.
 Maybe a little backrest ...

34
00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:34.720
So...

35
00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:38.920
It smells good.
 Do you have a new perfume?

36
00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:42.680
Louis Vuitton, I like it.

37
00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:45.040
Well ...

38
00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:52.960
Calm down, old man!
 Maybe we should start by looking at something.

39
00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:59.280
What does the company want to look at?

40
00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:04.760
What did you say?
 Oh, you have good taste.

41
00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:07.800
I like that.

42
00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:13.800
This one is good.

43
00:04:18.480 --> 00:04:24.440
Watch the movie, you shouldn't sit and watch me.

44
00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:33.080
This devil is good.
 Horses and stuff.
 It's tear.

45
00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:40.600
I like you.
 You are a good girl, straightforward.

46
00:04:50.280 --> 00:04:52.800
Damn...

47
00:05:06.520 --> 00:05:10.680
Oh!
 Now it gets hot in the old man.

48
00:05:10.840 --> 00:05:15.920
It might be time to move towards the bed room.

49
00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:19.080
Mobile signal

50
00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:20.400
Cursed ...

51
00:05:21.600 --> 00:05:25.840
-Hello.
 - Well, I'm.

52
00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:32.080
It's so damn boring here.
 I will soon kill myself.
 What are you doing?

53
00:05:32.240 --> 00:05:37.680
- I seal the roof.
 What do you want?
 - I just want to talk a little.

54
00:05:37.840 --> 00:05:39.800
Gnawing

55
00:05:38.920 --> 00:05:43.560
-What was that?
 A horse?
 -No.

56
00:05:43.720 --> 00:05:51.080
Now a carpenter came in.
 I have to hang up.
 See you later.

57
00:05:51.240 --> 00:05:54.280
Hello?

58
00:05:56.240 --> 00:06:03.200
He does not understand that you need to have some lonely time, and be allowed to be yourself.

59
00:06:03.800 --> 00:06:10.680
What do you crave?
 Wine?
 Beer?
 Then I fix some beer.

60
00:06:11.600 --> 00:06:14.640
Sit on, old man.

61
00:06:17.280 --> 00:06:20.840
I'll be coming soon.
 The beer is over.

62
00:06:33.080 --> 00:06:36.040
What the hell...

63
00:06:36.640 --> 00:06:40.440
No, I'm working.
 It's not possible.

64
00:06:42.200 --> 00:06:45.240
Calm down, I'll come.

65
00:06:48.240 --> 00:06:51.320
Leif, what are you doing?

66
00:06:51.480 --> 00:06:57.280
I need money for materials.
 Can you get advance on the salary?

67
00:06:57.440 --> 00:07:02.480
Advance?
 It's my first day, I can't ask for advance.

68
00:07:02.640 --> 00:07:06.440
- Do you want the house to collapse?
 -No.

69
00:07:06.600 --> 00:07:12.080
- Then maybe you should help.
 - Yes, calm.
 I may well ask.

70
00:07:12.240 --> 00:07:15.200
Calm down.

71
00:07:23.480 --> 00:07:29.240
- God, what embarrassing.
 Here.
 -Thanks.
 Good work.
 See you later.

72
00:07:43.720 --> 00:07:46.680
- Tjena, Jerker.
 -How is it going?

73
00:07:46.840 --> 00:07:51.680
It's totally fucking useless.
 So damn boring.

74
00:07:51.840 --> 00:07:55.800
I'd rather have been home.

75
00:07:58.560 --> 00:08:01.640
But what the hell?

76
00:08:01.800 --> 00:08:06.840
Did he buy beer for the money, the damn latrine?

77
00:08:13.880 --> 00:08:18.560
Do you want to help me with one thing, Jerker?

78
00:08:18.720 --> 00:08:24.360
Well ... I really need the salary.

79
00:08:25.400 --> 00:08:31.240
- How much do you earn in one day?
 –200.

80
00:08:31.400 --> 00:08:35.040
I can give you 300. Are you on?

81
00:08:35.200 --> 00:08:40.200
Okay.
 But the boss will never allow it.

82
00:08:42.520 --> 00:08:45.560
See and learn, Jerker.

83
00:08:48.760 --> 00:08:53.800
- Fuck ... hormos, come here!
 –What disgusting.

84
00:08:54.560 --> 00:08:57.000
Fy fuck.

85
00:08:57.160 --> 00:09:02.080
I've got stomach ailment.
 Jerker has infected me.

86
00:09:02.240 --> 00:09:06.880
Out here, both.
 Out!
 Away.

87
00:09:20.320 --> 00:09:25.400
Is that your brother?
 Is it him we are going to fuck with?

88
00:09:25.560 --> 00:09:31.120
Yeah.
 I'm not going to let him lie down and laze himself the whole Dan-

89
00:09:31.280 --> 00:09:37.320
- As I work my ass.
 Now he should look at fuck.

90
00:09:43.320 --> 00:09:46.280
Mobile signal

91
00:09:46.440 --> 00:09:49.440
Hell...

92
00:09:50.600 --> 00:09:54.760
–Leif.
 - It's Billy.
 What are you doing?

93
00:09:54.920 --> 00:10:01.360
I sit a little inconvenient.
 I'm up on the roof.
 What do you want?

94
00:10:01.520 --> 00:10:04.760
I was just going to check what you are doing.

95
00:10:04.920 --> 00:10:10.000
You can't call all the time.
 I have a lot to do.

96
00:10:10.160 --> 00:10:16.080
I apologize.
 I was just going to say that I'm working over today.

97
00:10:16.240 --> 00:10:20.200
We have a lot to do.

98
00:10:20.360 --> 00:10:24.320
How good you are.
 Wow.
 See ya.

99
00:10:24.560 --> 00:10:27.560
Oh my God...

100
00:10:27.800 --> 00:10:31.400
Then we get a little more time for each other.

101
00:10:31.560 --> 00:10:35.520
Fy fuck.
 - Jerker, run away.

102
00:10:46.160 --> 00:10:49.200
Mobile signal

103
00:10:52.360 --> 00:10:54.920
Leif Öhman.

104
00:10:55.080 --> 00:10:59.280
It is from department ten on the psyche.

105
00:10:59.440 --> 00:11:02.640
Then you called wrong.

106
00:11:02.800 --> 00:11:11.080
We call people to tell you that a psychic man has escaped.

107
00:11:11.240 --> 00:11:15.320
He was just seen in your neighborhoods.

108
00:11:15.480 --> 00:11:21.560
So it's good if you lock doors and windows and keep you indoors.

109
00:11:21.720 --> 00:11:24.760
Then we know.

110
00:11:26.480 --> 00:11:29.440
Fuck!

111
00:11:29.600 --> 00:11:32.560
Satan's Hell!

112
00:11:33.960 --> 00:11:40.920
Has!
 Get away from me.
 I kill you.
 Get off my yard.
 Tvi.

113
00:11:48.960 --> 00:11:53.440
Take it easy, the old man.
 No problem.

114
00:11:52.840 --> 00:11:55.840
Mobile signal

115
00:11:53.600 --> 00:11:57.000
Cursed, what it rings all the time.

116
00:11:57.160 --> 00:12:01.760
–Leif Öhman.
 - It's from the psyche again.

117
00:12:01.920 --> 00:12:07.640
I forgot to tell you that one should avoid eye contact with the man.

118
00:12:07.800 --> 00:12:09.800
Why?

119
00:12:09.960 --> 00:12:14.960
He is fatal.
 He can't handle eye contact.

120
00:12:15.120 --> 00:12:19.520
He wants to murder if he makes eye contact.

121
00:12:19.680 --> 00:12:25.280
I think he was here exactly.
 Hello!
 Can you hear me?

122
00:12:25.440 --> 00:12:28.400
Cursed.

123
00:12:50.720 --> 00:12:55.760
- Yours, Leif.
 - Where the hell are the shots for the rifle?

124
00:12:55.920 --> 00:12:58.880
They ended last week.

125
00:12:59.040 --> 00:13:06.280
Come here.
 There is some psychopath here.
 Say you got salmonella.

126
00:13:06.440 --> 00:13:11.560
I can not hear what you're saying.
 There seems to be bad reception.

127
00:13:11.720 --> 00:13:16.160
- I have to continue working.
 - Billy.
 Hello!

128
00:13:16.320 --> 00:13:18.880
Hell!

129
00:13:20.160 --> 00:13:22.560
Sorry.

130
00:13:24.440 --> 00:13:27.920
Okay, take it easy.
 Think!

131
00:13:35.200 --> 00:13:38.360
Calm, old man.
 I'll fix this.

132
00:13:42.120 --> 00:13:48.640
Fuck off!
 Leave from here.
 I have weapon.
 I'm weaponized.

133
00:13:48.800 --> 00:13:52.440
I'm Armed with ... Stick!

134
00:13:56.120 --> 00:13:58.480
Calm down, baby.

135
00:13:58.640 --> 00:14:01.360
Solbäck police.

136
00:14:01.520 --> 00:14:05.160
An ax killer psychopath wants to kill me.

137
00:14:05.320 --> 00:14:09.280
Stop it.
 We don't have time with this.

138
00:14:09.440 --> 00:14:14.160
He is getting into the house.
 Send someone here!

139
00:14:14.320 --> 00:14:17.640
It is best that it is for real.

140
00:14:17.800 --> 00:14:24.080
Take it easy, baby.
 It is perhaps now we may say goodbye.

141
00:14:27.520 --> 00:14:31.120
No, stop!
 Turn off.

142
00:14:31.280 --> 00:14:34.240
Hey.
 Is it Leif who has called?

143
00:14:34.400 --> 00:14:39.120
Yes, he had some psychopathic madness after him.

144
00:14:39.280 --> 00:14:42.200
It's just a prank.

145
00:14:42.360 --> 00:14:46.760
- A prank?
 -Yes.
 Don't know what it is?

146
00:14:46.920 --> 00:14:52.400
Yes, but we have more important things for us than to run after you.

147
00:14:52.560 --> 00:14:55.800
Yes, it was stupid.
 Sorry, the constable.

148
00:14:55.960 --> 00:15:01.560
- Don't fuck this again.
 -No I promise.
 Never again.

149
00:15:01.720 --> 00:15:06.680
Clear end, the constable.
 Have a nice day.

151
00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:25.760
–Leif.
 -Hello.
 It is from the police station.

152
00:15:25.920 --> 00:15:34.120
We have been prevented.
 A tree has fallen down, so we can't come.

153
00:15:34.280 --> 00:15:39.320
What the hell am I going to do?
 Help me.
 Say what to do.

154
00:15:39.480 --> 00:15:43.600
Unfortunately, we can't do anything.
 Bye.

155
00:15:45.800 --> 00:15:49.840
Damn.
 DAMN!
 Satan!

156
00:15:51.760 --> 00:15:54.680
Satan.

157
00:15:58.440 --> 00:16:01.960
Okay, Jerker.
 Now we run the last step.

158
00:16:02.120 --> 00:16:06.080
Isn't it going a little too far?

159
00:16:06.240 --> 00:16:11.040
- Do you want to have your money?
 -Yes.

160
00:16:11.200 --> 00:16:14.160
Come on here now.

161
00:16:19.280 --> 00:16:22.320
Glass is crushed

162
00:16:23.600 --> 00:16:26.560
Satan!
 NO!

163
00:16:32.520 --> 00:16:34.680
Satan.

164
00:16:40.240 --> 00:16:46.280
Fuck!
 We have to jump, honey.
 I have no choice.

165
00:16:48.280 --> 00:16:51.200
What the hell?

166
00:16:51.360 --> 00:16:55.280
Follow and scare the shit out of him.

167
00:16:55.440 --> 00:16:59.160
God cursed, Billy Öhman.

168
00:17:07.600 --> 00:17:11.480
Billy, come fast!
 Billy!

169
00:17:16.120 --> 00:17:19.600
What the hell have you been doing?
 - Leif!

170
00:17:19.760 --> 00:17:24.800
- What the hell have you done?
 - I said it went too far.

171
00:17:24.960 --> 00:17:30.080
Take it easy, Leif, breathe.
 Wake up, Leif.
 The ambulance is coming soon.

172
00:17:36.200 --> 00:17:40.640
He seems to suffer from post -traumatic stress.

173
00:17:40.800 --> 00:17:47.200
It is important that he is not exposed to any strenuous activity.

174
00:17:47.360 --> 00:17:50.360
Okay.
 Thanks so much.

175
00:17:54.360 --> 00:18:00.880
Now I'll take care of you, the brother.
 You should not have to do anything.

176
00:18:02.800 --> 00:18:08.440
I will help you with everything.
 You'll be good again soon.

177
00:18:08.600 --> 00:18:12.520
So.
 Let's see...

178
00:18:12.680 --> 00:18:15.680
So, then we go.
 Can you stand?

179
00:18:16.120 --> 00:18:21.720
Everything will be okay.
 I'll never do it again, I promise.
