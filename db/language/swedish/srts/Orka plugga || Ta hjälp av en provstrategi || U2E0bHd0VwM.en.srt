1
00:00:00,400 --> 00:00:02,320
Then it was test again!

2
00:00:02,480 --> 00:00:06,680
Does it feel like everything you could be as blown away?

3
00:00:06,840 --> 00:00:09,760
Then it is good to have a test strategy.

4
00:00:09,920 --> 00:00:13,800
Come to the sample measured and rested.
 A little tedious?

5
00:00:13,960 --> 00:00:17,120
Yes, but that's good.

6
00:00:17,280 --> 00:00:22,120
First read the test.
 Then you get a look at what it contains-

7
00:00:22,280 --> 00:00:25,480
-And there will be no surprises.

8
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:32,520
One tip is to mark the verbs.
 What are you expected to do?

9
00:00:32,680 --> 00:00:38,000
There may be several issues in the same task.
 Number them.

10
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:43,800
Don't you really understand a question?
 Ask your teacher for help.

11
00:00:43,960 --> 00:00:48,120
In other words, ask them to develop and describe.

12
00:00:48,280 --> 00:00:53,440
Then you can get tips so that you respond to what is actually in demand.

13
00:00:54,680 --> 00:00:58,440
Also ask the teacher to say at different times-

14
00:00:58,600 --> 00:01:01,400
-So you don't have to keep track of yourself.

15
00:01:01,560 --> 00:01:06,400
A very good part of the strategy is to have some time over at the end.

16
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:10,560
Then you can read through your answers again.

17
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:16,680
Then you can detect carelessness yourself, instead of the teacher.

18
00:01:17,560 --> 00:01:22,120
Make the following a habit while sitting with a sample.

19
00:01:22,280 --> 00:01:27,000
Read the test.
 Number the questions.

20
00:01:27,160 --> 00:01:31,320
Underline the verbs.
 Dare to ask questions.

21
00:01:31,480 --> 00:01:37,040
Keep track of time.
 Read your answers before submitting.

22
00:01:41,760 --> 00:01:45,600
