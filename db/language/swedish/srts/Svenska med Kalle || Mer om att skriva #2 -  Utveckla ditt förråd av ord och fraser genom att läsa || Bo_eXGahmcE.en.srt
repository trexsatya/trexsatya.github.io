00:00:00,955 --> 00:00:01,955
Hello Hello

2
00:00:03,295 --> 00:00:06,145
I was going to keep talking a little about

3
00:00:06,145 --> 00:00:09,475
how to improve one's writing

4
00:00:09,925 --> 00:00:12,745
and in the last movie I did about it

5
00:00:12,745 --> 00:00:15,885
So I talked a little more big about that

6
00:00:15,885 --> 00:00:18,395
Writing is about thinking

7
00:00:18,705 --> 00:00:21,735
and discuss, both discuss with

8
00:00:21,735 --> 00:00:24,775
self and discuss with others so

9
00:00:24,775 --> 00:00:27,755
To write better so you need to be curious

10
00:00:27,755 --> 00:00:30,265
on the world and so to speak

11
00:00:30,265 --> 00:00:33,285
develop your thinking too, not

12
00:00:33,285 --> 00:00:34,445
Just your language

13
00:00:35,045 --> 00:00:38,095
In this movie I will try to go into a little more on

14
00:00:38,095 --> 00:00:40,455
The language part then

15
00:00:40,455 --> 00:00:43,605
If one thinks of yourself

16
00:00:43,605 --> 00:00:46,495
the language you need to

17
00:00:46,495 --> 00:00:49,975
able to express your thoughts in a good way

18
00:00:51,625 --> 00:00:53,615
And then I don't think exactly

19
00:00:53,945 --> 00:00:57,025
on grammar and order and such things

20
00:00:57,025 --> 00:01:00,075
Without liters more how

21
00:01:00,075 --> 00:01:02,775
one should find and learn

22
00:01:02,775 --> 00:01:05,725
a language that one can use when one

23
00:01:05,725 --> 00:01:06,725
Writes

24
00:01:06,935 --> 00:01:08,425
and

25
00:01:09,575 --> 00:01:11,105
A good goal

26
00:01:11,805 --> 00:01:15,115
a simple and good goal to have

27
00:01:15,165 --> 00:01:18,115
When writing a text, it is to

28
00:01:18,115 --> 00:01:20,865
The one who reads the text should not

29
00:01:20,865 --> 00:01:24,095
at all need to think or be

30
00:01:24,095 --> 00:01:26,535
unsure what you mean

31
00:01:27,395 --> 00:01:30,265
so especially if you write any type

32
00:01:30,265 --> 00:01:33,345
by investigative or debate

33
00:01:33,345 --> 00:01:36,245
or accounting

34
00:01:36,245 --> 00:01:39,365
text and so on

35
00:01:39,365 --> 00:01:42,355
informative text in the school, ie one such

36
00:01:42,355 --> 00:01:45,155
academic or formal text

37
00:01:45,565 --> 00:01:48,395
Then I think a good goal is

38
00:01:48,395 --> 00:01:51,345
that the reader should have as easily as possible

39
00:01:51,345 --> 00:01:53,105
To understand your thought

40
00:01:54,345 --> 00:01:57,205
And it is not always easy to write

41
00:01:57,205 --> 00:01:59,385
so that it is completely

42
00:01:59,385 --> 00:02:00,795
clearly what one means

43
00:02:01,595 --> 00:02:04,765
okay and how to then

44
00:02:04,765 --> 00:02:07,915
get better at this to express their thoughts

45
00:02:07,985 --> 00:02:11,095
Well you need exactly

46
00:02:11,095 --> 00:02:12,375
right word

47
00:02:12,695 --> 00:02:15,555
one needs many different words

48
00:02:15,555 --> 00:02:18,665
and expressions of expressing one's

49
00:02:18,665 --> 00:02:20,165
thought exactly

50
00:02:20,795 --> 00:02:23,125
So then you need to learn it

51
00:02:23,715 --> 00:02:24,715
null

52
00:02:24,815 --> 00:02:27,705
And then I think the best way

53
00:02:27,705 --> 00:02:30,725
To do that is to read articles

54
00:02:30,725 --> 00:02:33,725
and texts and books so we'll be right away

55
00:02:33,725 --> 00:02:36,965
back to this with the reading then but

56
00:02:36,965 --> 00:02:39,685
One thing I want to warn a little about

57
00:02:39,735 --> 00:02:42,725
that is to believe that you can translate

58
00:02:42,725 --> 00:02:45,725
from your language directly to Swedish

59
00:02:45,925 --> 00:02:49,025
my feeling when I read people who are on a little

60
00:02:49,025 --> 00:02:51,675
higher level, perhaps the last course on

61
00:02:51,675 --> 00:02:54,895
sfi, sfi d, or on the

62
00:02:54,895 --> 00:02:57,735
Next primary and high school courses

63
00:02:58,745 --> 00:03:01,635
a problem that I think I see quite

64
00:03:01,635 --> 00:03:04,385
Often, it is that, it looks like

65
00:03:04,385 --> 00:03:07,535
Person has translated expression from their own language

66
00:03:07,535 --> 00:03:10,085
to Swedish

67
00:03:10,215 --> 00:03:13,155
I'm not sure, but I believe that sometimes anyway

68
00:03:14,065 --> 00:03:15,065
And it will be

69
00:03:15,085 --> 00:03:17,785
quite often a little wrong or sounds a bit

70
00:03:17,785 --> 00:03:20,715
weird, it might be the right grammar sometimes

71
00:03:20,715 --> 00:03:21,715
But it won't be

72
00:03:22,035 --> 00:03:23,815
correct expression in Swedish

73
00:03:24,345 --> 00:03:26,545
So that's why I would say that

74
00:03:26,895 --> 00:03:29,875
Don't trust that much

75
00:03:29,875 --> 00:03:31,875
that method of taking

76
00:03:32,575 --> 00:03:35,645
expression and words that you can in your language

77
00:03:35,645 --> 00:03:38,775
and translate them with a lexicon or with

78
00:03:38,775 --> 00:03:41,515
as well as that you can translate it yourself

79
00:03:41,595 --> 00:03:43,455
Don't be sure it gets right

80
00:03:44,325 --> 00:03:47,165
Without then I think the reading

81
00:03:47,165 --> 00:03:49,980
is a better method

82
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:53,600
Please tell me if I'm wrong, I don't know, I've never learned this

83
00:03:53,605 --> 00:03:56,635
self on such a high level in another language

84
00:03:56,635 --> 00:03:59,725
so i guess a little here, but i think

85
00:03:59,725 --> 00:04:02,745
to find all these words

86
00:04:02,745 --> 00:04:05,345
and the expressions that you need

87
00:04:05,545 --> 00:04:07,935
So I think it's better to look for

88
00:04:07,935 --> 00:04:10,475
them in real texts on .svenska

89
00:04:11,565 --> 00:04:14,685
And it's easy to say

90
00:04:14,685 --> 00:04:17,775
Read more, read more

91
00:04:17,775 --> 00:04:20,745
I will talk about this in at least one movie to

92
00:04:20,745 --> 00:04:23,855
But then my suggestion then, if we think this is that

93
00:04:23,855 --> 00:04:25,825
The goal is for it to be easy and clear

94
00:04:26,145 --> 00:04:29,215
and you should find (so to speak) common expressions

95
00:04:29,215 --> 00:04:32,055
as Swedes and people who are

96
00:04:32,055 --> 00:04:35,075
Good in Swedish uses when writing texts

97
00:04:35,075 --> 00:04:38,015
Then there are two things you can

98
00:04:38,015 --> 00:04:39,315
Start looking * with * (after)

99
00:04:39,635 --> 00:04:42,635
and there are different expressions and words

100
00:04:42,635 --> 00:04:45,345
that tells you what time

101
00:04:45,345 --> 00:04:48,195
and which place something happens at

102
00:04:48,195 --> 00:04:51,385
For remember, it should be as easy as possible

103
00:04:51,385 --> 00:04:54,385
For those who read that

104
00:04:54,385 --> 00:04:55,245
follow

105
00:04:55,245 --> 00:04:58,335
and then the person must understand which

106
00:04:58,335 --> 00:05:00,505
are which places are you talking about

107
00:05:01,105 --> 00:05:03,275
and how is the face of

108
00:05:03,275 --> 00:05:05,075
those places to each other

109
00:05:05,555 --> 00:05:07,845
We must understand if it is

110
00:05:07,845 --> 00:05:10,725
two places that are close to each other or

111
00:05:10,725 --> 00:05:13,715
far away from each other, in the same country or

112
00:05:13,715 --> 00:05:16,675
in completely different places, if they are

113
00:05:16,675 --> 00:05:18,575
equal or different and so on

114
00:05:19,005 --> 00:05:22,235
And then if you read, for example, articles

115
00:05:22,235 --> 00:05:24,975
In the news or factual texts

116
00:05:24,975 --> 00:05:27,925
or texts in a textbook you have

117
00:05:27,925 --> 00:05:30,585
so can you start looking at how

118
00:05:30,585 --> 00:05:32,845
writes the writer about location

119
00:05:33,795 --> 00:05:36,775
and think like this: what words and which

120
00:05:36,775 --> 00:05:39,795
Expressions I can use, so I just

121
00:05:39,795 --> 00:05:40,795
thought a little bit here

122
00:05:41,135 --> 00:05:43,725
that you may need to say things like

123
00:05:43,725 --> 00:05:46,825
closely and near

124
00:05:46,825 --> 00:05:49,565
And far away

125
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:51,500
in the centre of

126
00:05:52,180 --> 00:05:55,020
Sweden or in the center of Stade

127
00:05:55,020 --> 00:05:57,220
in the outskirts of

128
00:05:57,545 --> 00:05:59,375
or outside

129
00:05:59,925 --> 00:06:03,175
by the coast, in the middle of the country

130
00:06:03,605 --> 00:06:07,085
at the same place or

131
00:06:07,195 --> 00:06:08,775
In another place

132
00:06:09,215 --> 00:06:12,375
So, this be just examples but

133
00:06:12,375 --> 00:06:15,425
I think that if you start gathering these pretty

134
00:06:15,425 --> 00:06:17,995
ease the expressions, in a way

135
00:06:18,285 --> 00:06:21,555
But it is difficult because there are so many

136
00:06:21,835 --> 00:06:25,225
and you want to use the correct situation

137
00:06:26,535 --> 00:06:29,455
And the same is with time, we want to understand

138
00:06:29,455 --> 00:06:32,605
If two things happen at the same time

139
00:06:32,605 --> 00:06:35,955
or if one happens before

140
00:06:35,955 --> 00:06:36,955
or after

141
00:06:37,015 --> 00:06:39,775
so you need expressions as

142
00:06:39,780 --> 00:06:41,780
at the same time

143
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,500
during that period

144
00:06:43,835 --> 00:06:45,305
that year

145
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:48,520
next year

146
00:06:48,520 --> 00:06:49,900
soon after

147
00:06:50,445 --> 00:06:52,865
A few weeks earlier

148
00:06:53,345 --> 00:06:56,465
that said, these are just examples like me

149
00:06:56,465 --> 00:06:59,255
thought about when I prepared this one

150
00:06:59,255 --> 00:07:02,305
the movie, but I think that if you read

151
00:07:02,315 --> 00:07:05,115
texts so these are two things you can think about

152
00:07:05,115 --> 00:07:08,025
and when you feel this I can use

153
00:07:08,205 --> 00:07:09,655
write it down then

154
00:07:10,305 --> 00:07:13,055
so that you collect small pieces

155
00:07:13,055 --> 00:07:15,035
small phrases, small sentences

156
00:07:15,385 --> 00:07:18,395
and trying to think about

157
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:21,000
How the writer uses it

158
00:07:21,160 --> 00:07:24,275
exactly what thought uses the one that has

159
00:07:24,275 --> 00:07:27,285
written the text to

160
00:07:27,285 --> 00:07:30,345
Explain, to tell,

161
00:07:30,345 --> 00:07:32,515
In order to show one's thought

162
00:07:33,395 --> 00:07:36,255
and the more such expressions you have

163
00:07:37,475 --> 00:07:40,385
The more you can try using them

164
00:07:40,385 --> 00:07:43,145
and then you can get feedback from a teacher

165
00:07:43,145 --> 00:07:46,375
or someone who reads your texts that “I understand”

166
00:07:46,375 --> 00:07:49,635
"I don't understand" "this expression

167
00:07:49,635 --> 00:07:50,635
Fits well here ”

168
00:07:51,015 --> 00:07:53,395
"This expression is a bit wrong"

169
00:07:54,045 --> 00:07:56,435
But as I said, I guess

170
00:07:56,435 --> 00:07:59,195
that if you pick your expressions

171
00:07:59,195 --> 00:08:02,235
from real Swedish texts and then attempts

172
00:08:02,235 --> 00:08:03,235
use them

173
00:08:03,405 --> 00:08:06,055
so is there more chance that you

174
00:08:06,055 --> 00:08:08,625
Finds common expressions

175
00:08:08,625 --> 00:08:11,475
that fits well than if you try

176
00:08:11,475 --> 00:08:13,455
translate from your language

177
00:08:14,525 --> 00:08:17,555
If you have experience with this, if you have learned

178
00:08:17,555 --> 00:08:20,375
to be better at writing so you are happy to get

179
00:08:20,525 --> 00:08:21,525
say

180
00:08:21,735 --> 00:08:24,735
Am I right here?
 or am I wrong?

181
00:08:24,740 --> 00:08:26,100
What do you think?

182
00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:27,700
And how have you been doing?

183
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:29,820
Anyway I am

184
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:32,785
Absolutely sure that if you read more

185
00:08:32,785 --> 00:08:35,415
so will you develop your language

186
00:08:35,825 --> 00:08:38,815
and if you read and think about what you read

187
00:08:38,815 --> 00:08:41,845
And chases

188
00:08:41,845 --> 00:08:44,805
what you need to be able to express

189
00:08:44,965 --> 00:08:48,345
More in Swedish

190
00:08:48,625 --> 00:08:51,585
so your reading will become more

191
00:08:51,585 --> 00:08:54,240
effective than if you only read passively

192
00:08:55,340 --> 00:08:58,740
And the tip for this video then is to read

193
00:08:59,060 --> 00:09:00,462
think about what you are reading

194
00:09:00,462 --> 00:09:03,120
and look at how writers

195
00:09:03,580 --> 00:09:05,475
expresses place

196
00:09:05,475 --> 00:09:08,415
Explains place and how the writer

197
00:09:08,415 --> 00:09:11,435
Explains and shows and

198
00:09:11,435 --> 00:09:13,065
describes time

199
00:09:13,465 --> 00:09:16,485
so can we get back to other things that are also

200
00:09:16,485 --> 00:09:19,245
important to be able to express in another video.

201
00:09:19,965 --> 00:09:23,125
Okay, I'll stop there and

202
00:09:23,125 --> 00:09:25,995
Hope there was something here that you were in advance of

203
00:09:25,995 --> 00:09:27,795
As you thought to

204
00:09:28,165 --> 00:09:30,295
That should I think about

205
00:09:30,825 --> 00:09:34,255
Please write a comment

206
00:09:34,255 --> 00:09:37,275
And please press your thumbs up if you liked the video

207
00:09:37,275 --> 00:09:38,855
and thumbs down if you didn't like it

208
00:09:39,385 --> 00:09:42,515
and as I said please discuss

209
00:09:42,605 --> 00:09:45,755
with me if you got any thoughts of this video

210
00:09:46,335 --> 00:09:49,275
It is of course texted so you have not seen

211
00:09:49,275 --> 00:09:52,235
the video with text so you can turn on the text in

212
00:09:52,235 --> 00:09:53,275
the settings

213
00:09:53,865 --> 00:09:56,845
And so I hope I can put up talk

214
00:09:56,845 --> 00:09:59,995
about this by developing their writing

215
00:09:59,995 --> 00:10:02,385
pretty soon again, in a new movie

216
00:10:03,335 --> 00:10:04,725
Have a good time so long.

217
00:10:05,095 --> 00:10:06,095
Bye.
