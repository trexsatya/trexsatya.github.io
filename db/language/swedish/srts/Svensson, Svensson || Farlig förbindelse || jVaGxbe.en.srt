1
00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:23.520
Wake up ... Wake up, Gustav, it is quarter past six.

2
00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:32.440
Wake up now.
 People want their post!

3
00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:45.000
- I dreamed that I was a zebra.
 -How fun.

4
00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:53.920
I blasted under Africa's sun.
 Completely free.
 Not a clock radio in sight.

5
00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:58.920
My only duty was to be zebra.

6
00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:08.080
But now you are a postman and you are in a terrible rush.

7
00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:16.040
I do not want to.
 It is ten degrees cold and today the sponsorship week begins.

8
00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:26.560
- Gustav, then something new happens.
 - Yes, everything takes twice as long.

9
00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:30.320
They go well with you to learn.

10
00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:36.240
They see the profession as any job.

11
00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:40.720
When it is in fact a religion?

12
00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:45.520
Not everyone is created for this profession.

13
00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:49.920
We have a great responsibility.

14
00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:56.400
A miss, so the postcard is wrong ...

15
00:02:56.560 --> 00:03:04.360
- I don't want to, I don't want to.
 - Ask someone for help with the trainees.

16
00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:10.400
Pettersson has never taken care of any trainee.

17
00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:18.360
You are right.
 This time he may take responsibility.
 I've had enough.

18
00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:30.840
Maybe you should call someone and announce your decision?
 Gustav!

19
00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:34.840
Okay.
 Okay...

20
00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:43.000
I'm tired of this.
 Nothing new is never happening.

21
00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:47.480
Yes.
 The hot water heater is broken.

22
00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:54.320
Then I don't have to shower anyway.

23
00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:08.680
-What are you doing?
 - snowball war with Kasper and Olle.

24
00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:15.680
- They are only eight years old.
 -I know.
 They didn't have a chance.

25
00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:24.080
- Nothing happens this year.
 - Gustav slipped into Olsson's garage.

26
00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:31.080
- It's the third time that is happening.
 - But now some tires take the bumps.

27
00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:37.960
-How are you?
 - Gustav's internship week begins today.

28
00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:44.440
Last year he was a sponsor for the one who would jump from the water tower.

29
00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:50.000
-Why?
 - He wanted a new sponsor.

30
00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:57.960
- Did Gustav have to stand every year?
 - He said he would say ...

31
00:04:59.640 --> 00:05:04.000
Do you avoid the trainee?

32
00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:08.680
No, it was hopeless.

33
00:05:08.840 --> 00:05:14.680
- Pettersson then?
 - He wasn't even there.

34
00:05:14.840 --> 00:05:22.640
Sara, Kaspers and Olle's parents are looking for you.
 They looked angry.

35
00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:31.120
- Don't you see people exploit you?
 - Next year I hit the table in the table.

36
00:05:31.280 --> 00:05:35.480
Oh, I have to at a boring party.

37
00:05:35.640 --> 00:05:43.400
I thought he liked the letter carrier party.
 Drink Sangria out of the post horns ...

38
00:05:43.560 --> 00:05:50.400
It is at the staff parties.
 This is for the students.

39
00:05:50.560 --> 00:05:57.800
- December is not his month.
 - There is a nice story about it.

40
00:05:57.960 --> 00:06:05.440
Have you heard the story of the family chanterelle and uncle Frost?

41
00:06:05.600 --> 00:06:10.240
I think I will hear it now.

42
00:06:10.400 --> 00:06:18.480
The best chanterelles knew where to wake up and extend to the sun.

43
00:06:18.640 --> 00:06:25.200
But one morning there was no sun anymore.

44
00:06:25.360 --> 00:06:30.480
- Father Frost had arrived.
 - You've heard it?

45
00:06:30.640 --> 00:06:34.960
A wild guess, only.

46
00:06:35.120 --> 00:06:41.960
They pulsed through the snow to find the heat again.

47
00:06:42.120 --> 00:06:45.120
Chanterelles cannot walk, Sara.

48
00:06:45.280 --> 00:06:50.600
This is a fairy tale!
 They went and went ...

49
00:06:50.760 --> 00:06:59.440
Finally, they arrived at a glade in the forest where there was a small house.

50
00:06:59.600 --> 00:07:06.600
- They went in there and warmed themselves.
 - No one opened, so they froze to death.

51
00:07:06.760 --> 00:07:14.880
- Have you not intended to write children's books?
 - We have to keep us away from the cold.

52
00:07:15.040 --> 00:07:22.200
- Otherwise, we are the chanterelles.
 - You don't want to ...

53
00:07:22.360 --> 00:07:28.640
- It's not getting late.
 - What a nice jacket!

54
00:07:28.800 --> 00:07:36.240
- Do you have shaving water on you?
 -Oh really?
 Maybe it came a little on the chin.

55
00:07:39.120 --> 00:07:42.760
- Hi, Gustav!
 –Lellinor ...

56
00:07:42.920 --> 00:07:50.720
I know we would meet at the intersection, but it was so cold.

57
00:07:50.880 --> 00:07:55.520
My trainee that I talked about ...

58
00:08:02.840 --> 00:08:06.680
Sara, our neighbor ...

59
00:08:06.840 --> 00:08:13.960
There is my wife Lena, we are married to each other.

60
00:08:14.120 --> 00:08:20.360
- We should give us off.
 - I have to say goodbye.

61
00:08:20.520 --> 00:08:28.200
We have had so much fun.
 I don't understand how he can be so helpful.

62
00:08:28.360 --> 00:08:35.680
-I understand that.
 -Hello Darling.
 We will not be late.

63
00:08:35.840 --> 00:08:39.800
Come now, Gustav Gubben, we are late.

64
00:08:44.160 --> 00:08:51.280
But God, how good she was!
 Did you see what skin?

65
00:08:51.440 --> 00:08:58.440
- How to look in July ... - She doesn't live for that long.

66
00:08:58.600 --> 00:09:02.040
Is she sick?

67
00:09:08.360 --> 00:09:13.800
-Where is Dad?
 - You have no dad anymore.

68
00:09:13.960 --> 00:09:19.400
- Sara says you are jealous.
 - Sara is wrong!

69
00:09:19.560 --> 00:09:27.920
I want higher monthly money.
 My teacher said: Children should require their right.

70
00:09:28.080 --> 00:09:36.640
Then he can pay your monthly money ... then I have to raise Linas too.

71
00:09:36.800 --> 00:09:44.040
-She already has 300.-A 14-year-old has greater expenses.

72
00:09:44.200 --> 00:09:51.040
--P pills and folk beer?
 - Now you go to bed!

73
00:09:53.600 --> 00:10:00.880
- I suppose the discussion is over?
 -Really.
 Good night.

74
00:10:01.040 --> 00:10:07.880
-How did it go?
 - I should have as much as you.

75
00:10:08.040 --> 00:10:15.040
- I'm always four years ahead of you!
 - Not intellectually.

76
00:10:16.200 --> 00:10:20.800
- Hi, kids, dad is at home.
 -Hurray.

77
00:10:22.240 --> 00:10:26.800
Hello there.
 Are you already at home?

78
00:10:26.960 --> 00:10:34.280
The night that is so young.
 Almost younger than your trainee.

79
00:10:34.440 --> 00:10:41.880
--Ellinas are a bit sloppy.
 - Did she give you a goodnight kiss?

80
00:10:42.040 --> 00:10:49.960
- It seems like you were jealous.
 - Why would I be jealous?

81
00:10:50.120 --> 00:10:57.960
Tell us about the party.
 Were there any others there than you and cute Ellinor?

82
00:10:58.120 --> 00:11:05.960
It was probably the most boring kick I was on.
 Everyone was glowing.

83
00:11:06.120 --> 00:11:14.160
- You have a serpentine left in the neck.
 - Bosse tried to revive it.

84
00:11:14.320 --> 00:11:19.680
Don't you think I see what you are doing?

85
00:11:19.840 --> 00:11:24.440
I'm just saying Nettan Olsén.

86
00:11:26.160 --> 00:11:33.760
You carry like when you and the other guys ran after her.

87
00:11:33.920 --> 00:11:41.680
- You and I weren't even together!
 -No.
 So you could swing after her!

88
00:11:42.680 --> 00:11:48.400
You carried her from the school bus into the classroom.

89
00:11:48.560 --> 00:11:52.160
She had slept poorly and was tired.

90
00:11:52.320 --> 00:11:58.760
It's ridiculous!
 Ellinor is my trainee.

91
00:11:58.920 --> 00:12:05.800
- And you love her.
 - How can you believe it about me?

92
00:12:05.960 --> 00:12:10.520
This is part of my job.

93
00:12:10.680 --> 00:12:15.880
To lock Pettersson in the toilet?

94
00:12:16.040 --> 00:12:23.880
You had agreed that he would take over your trainee.

95
00:12:24.040 --> 00:12:29.320
- You have apparently changed.
 -Yes...

96
00:12:29.480 --> 00:12:34.080
I have a simple question: Why?

97
00:12:35.960 --> 00:12:42.080
- kids, go up and go to bed!
 - I want to hear how you get out of it.

98
00:12:47.920 --> 00:12:53.520
- In bed.
 - Come, we listen to the stairs instead.

99
00:12:58.680 --> 00:13:06.320
I had to.
 Pettersson is a bachelor.
 His gaze was nasty!

100
00:13:06.480 --> 00:13:14.240
- You are pathetic, Gustav.
 - It is actually a matter of morality!

101
00:13:14.400 --> 00:13:19.960
- What do you have there?
 - You mean the rose?

102
00:13:21.520 --> 00:13:24.400
To you...

103
00:13:28.560 --> 00:13:33.160
"We'll see you tomorrow. Puss. Ellinor."

104
00:13:47.320 --> 00:13:54.960
- Good morning, do you want coffee?
 - Don't make yourself.
 It's just me.

105
00:13:55.120 --> 00:14:03.560
- Do not pick up Max today.
 - Have I ever forgotten to pick up Max?

106
00:14:04.320 --> 00:14:11.160
Okay, once.
 But there were berries in the forest and he found home.

107
00:14:11.320 --> 00:14:18.680
- Max wants raised monthly money.
 - What do kids have nowadays?

108
00:14:18.840 --> 00:14:22.440
Ask Ellinor what she gets.

109
00:14:35.080 --> 00:14:40.760
Gustav Svensson.
 Tjena, Pettersson.
 It's fine.

110
00:14:40.920 --> 00:14:45.320
Tired of her?
 Not really.

111
00:14:45.480 --> 00:14:51.080
500 bucks?
 Not a chance.
 Ellinor needs me.

112
00:14:51.240 --> 00:14:58.480
Our relationship is based on trust - a word that you do not understand.

113
00:15:00.760 --> 00:15:06.200
- Hi, Gustav.
 –Stig on, just ...

114
00:15:06.360 --> 00:15:13.480
I have to ask you one thing.
 Your new trainee ...

115
00:15:13.640 --> 00:15:21.320
- Lena is not so fond of her.
 - She was Miss Mälardalen three times.

116
00:15:21.480 --> 00:15:26.720
Four.
 She has a good chance this year too.

117
00:15:26.880 --> 00:15:34.560
Do you think she can be a hair model for me on Saturday?
 I need a good picture.

118
00:15:34.720 --> 00:15:41.560
I can hear with her, but she is quite fully booked.

119
00:15:41.720 --> 00:15:48.560
- What is she going on?
 - Sorting and shipping lists.

120
00:15:48.720 --> 00:15:56.520
- She becomes a fantastic postman.
 - Then she does not have to harrow as a photo model.

121
00:15:58.440 --> 00:16:06.000
Honestly ... Don't you think Lena behaves strangely?

122
00:16:06.160 --> 00:16:13.960
How would you react if Lena started working late with a stylish business economist?

123
00:16:14.120 --> 00:16:18.800
I've been thinking a lot about it.

124
00:16:18.960 --> 00:16:26.920
I would make myself a shrimp, turn on Eurosport ... no, I'm kidding.

125
00:16:27.080 --> 00:16:35.400
I enjoy seeing Lena like this.
 That she still gets jealous!

126
00:16:35.560 --> 00:16:41.320
I see it.
 But don't drive it too far.

127
00:16:41.480 --> 00:16:49.000
- I will tell you the truth.
 --Ellinas are with children.
 You should accommodate.

128
00:16:50.040 --> 00:16:57.520
-Stop.
 You think I'm old -fashioned.
 - You think you have to marry you first?

129
00:16:58.240 --> 00:17:06.640
-Listen.
 You know who Pettersson is?
 - He who looks like Sean Connery!

130
00:17:06.800 --> 00:17:10.440
It doesn't belong here.
 He's dangerous!

131
00:17:10.600 --> 00:17:15.880
If I had not been, she would have been lost in his arms.

132
00:17:16.040 --> 00:17:19.360
How lovely it sounds ...

133
00:17:19.520 --> 00:17:25.040
- Pettersson is divorced!
 -I also.

134
00:17:25.200 --> 00:17:30.800
See for yourself!
 All normal instincts disappear.

135
00:17:30.960 --> 00:17:38.720
- There are only unsorted drives.
 - thank you, Gustav.
 I like you too.

136
00:17:38.880 --> 00:17:45.280
- Ask her if she can sit model.
 - Yes, when I hear from her.

137
00:17:59.160 --> 00:18:04.480
Postrone Svensson ... Pettersson?

138
00:18:05.800 --> 00:18:12.200
700?
 Never!
 Ellinor wants to be with me.

139
00:18:12.360 --> 00:18:16.200
Thats how it is.

140
00:18:21.440 --> 00:18:27.520
It felt strange to meet Ellinor.

141
00:18:27.680 --> 00:18:34.080
- Gustav is not a seductive type.
 - Don't say it!

142
00:18:34.240 --> 00:18:42.000
When I met him he had a red suit and spoke Italian.

143
00:18:42.160 --> 00:18:49.800
- He summer job like Piccolo.
 - Now the sponsor week is soon over.

144
00:18:49.960 --> 00:18:57.720
- If two days Ellinor goes home.
 - One to complete!
 The batter is soon over.

145
00:18:59.400 --> 00:19:07.160
I say that, it's been a long time since I ate these pancakes.

146
00:19:07.320 --> 00:19:14.080
- Hi, are you home before?
 - It was a surprise, I see.

147
00:19:14.240 --> 00:19:18.920
I borrowed some eggs and margarine.

148
00:19:19.080 --> 00:19:26.720
- I thought we would get something in the stomach.
 - A straight right, maybe ...

149
00:19:26.880 --> 00:19:34.800
- You probably have a lot to talk about.
 - Lee, should you have a pancake?

150
00:19:34.960 --> 00:19:42.840
- No, I think about what I eat.
 - It should be a bit to take in.

151
00:19:43.800 --> 00:19:50.560
- I never get up a single pound.
 -Poor little thing...

152
00:19:51.640 --> 00:20:00.560
- How does it feel to go home?
 - Gustav and I may be a couple.

153
00:20:03.280 --> 00:20:10.200
The management has talked about extending the sponsor week.

154
00:20:10.360 --> 00:20:15.920
-How long?
 -I do not know...

155
00:20:16.080 --> 00:20:21.400
-How long?
 "A six months," they said.

156
00:20:21.560 --> 00:20:29.320
- Then you have a chance of extension.
 –Postverket is not afraid of news

157
00:20:29.480 --> 00:20:33.760
Every new idea should be tried!

158
00:20:33.920 --> 00:20:41.360
We were the first in Europe to have winter tires on the bikes!

159
00:20:41.520 --> 00:20:47.200
Pioneers are what we are!
 Now we are going to work.

160
00:20:47.360 --> 00:20:55.080
Hello then, the old man.
 I'm back at ten o'clock.
 Kiss Kiss...

161
00:20:56.440 --> 00:21:03.280
- What a good looking thing she is!
 - Are you so young sometime?

162
00:21:04.360 --> 00:21:07.080
Eat up and shut up.

163
00:21:17.760 --> 00:21:25.040
- Lena, take it easy.
 - It's the third time he has been looking at me.

164
00:21:25.200 --> 00:21:32.200
- The long looking.
 - You have the clock behind you ...

165
00:21:36.680 --> 00:21:41.480
Surely this proves nothing?

166
00:21:41.640 --> 00:21:48.400
I want to know if I'm still attractive.

167
00:21:48.560 --> 00:21:55.200
- You are shitty!
 - But not like Miss Mälardalen, huh?

168
00:21:56.360 --> 00:22:02.120
Look, where Jesper comes!
 Focus now.

169
00:22:02.280 --> 00:22:06.840
Hello Sara.
 Full speed as usual?

170
00:22:07.000 --> 00:22:11.600
Nice with a place for all ages.

171
00:22:11.760 --> 00:22:18.600
-What do you mean by that?
 - This is my friend Lena.

172
00:22:18.760 --> 00:22:26.000
- You said something about ages.
 - You can have fun together regardless of age.

173
00:22:26.160 --> 00:22:31.800
All men are equally age -fixed!

174
00:22:31.960 --> 00:22:35.320
On the contrary.
 Age does not matter.

175
00:22:35.480 --> 00:22:42.720
- No, they can be as young as possible!
 - It's probably the best you go.

176
00:22:42.880 --> 00:22:49.560
- Hi, Jesper.
 - Stick, pork!
 - There he got!

177
00:22:50.480 --> 00:22:55.680
- Iidiot!
 - Yes, they are all like that.

178
00:22:55.840 --> 00:23:01.640
-Get it together.
 - I've been out before.

179
00:23:01.800 --> 00:23:06.120
I know how it goes.

180
00:23:06.280 --> 00:23:12.480
–What is said about a dance?
 - It's not a dance venue.

181
00:23:12.640 --> 00:23:16.080
Shit in it then!

182
00:23:45.480 --> 00:23:51.720
Is it the guard at the bank?
 It's Gustav Svensson.

183
00:23:51.880 --> 00:23:57.720
Can you check if my wife Lena is working over?

184
00:23:57.880 --> 00:24:05.480
You don't want to leave the TV?
 You want to know who the killer is first.

185
00:24:06.640 --> 00:24:12.920
You're sure she's not left?
 Thanks.

186
00:24:13.080 --> 00:24:17.320
The service is the killer.

187
00:24:34.960 --> 00:24:42.200
- Are you awake, Gustav?
 - Yes, I looked at the hockey match.

188
00:24:42.360 --> 00:24:48.680
They must have played for a long time.
 She is half past two.

189
00:24:48.840 --> 00:24:56.640
- Why are you coming home this late?
 - I have been with Sara in the pub.

190
00:24:57.920 --> 00:25:04.800
- Concern stamp!
 What have you done?
 - Dane.

191
00:25:04.960 --> 00:25:08.880
- With who then?
 -Yes...

192
00:25:09.040 --> 00:25:17.400
Jesper ... a young, charming guy I have danced with quite a lot.

193
00:25:17.560 --> 00:25:25.720
I have cried with worry, while you have been in your arms at Jesper.

194
00:25:25.880 --> 00:25:31.840
- Not all evening.
 A dance.
 - Yes ... and then?

195
00:25:32.000 --> 00:25:37.480
- Stefan, Tore, Björn ... - Is this true?

196
00:25:37.640 --> 00:25:44.080
What are you worried about?
 Is little Ellinor cold?

197
00:25:44.240 --> 00:25:48.880
Obviously I'm getting worried!

198
00:25:49.040 --> 00:25:56.840
"I stand out for a while. Don't forget that Lina will be confirmed this summer."

199
00:26:03.440 --> 00:26:10.280
- I wanted to scare you.
 - You have succeeded.

200
00:26:10.440 --> 00:26:17.120
- No thing has happened.
 -Is it safe?

201
00:26:17.280 --> 00:26:23.720
-Yes.
 Good night.
 - I also have something to tell.

202
00:26:23.880 --> 00:26:28.600
- Something fun.
 - Was Leksand?

203
00:26:28.760 --> 00:26:34.960
- I have renounced me Ellinor.
 -It was the worst.

204
00:26:35.120 --> 00:26:41.000
- Pettersson had to take over.
 -Why?

205
00:26:41.160 --> 00:26:46.400
I thought it was best.

206
00:26:46.560 --> 00:26:51.160
Ellinor is in love with him.

207
00:26:51.320 --> 00:26:56.560
–What are you grinning at?
 -Nothing.

208
00:26:56.720 --> 00:27:02.880
People fall in love with each other at the post office!

209
00:27:03.040 --> 00:27:10.720
Even if you think it sounds strange, I'm actually a little happy about it.

210
00:27:10.880 --> 00:27:18.600
Imagine you are still so terribly in love with me!

211
00:27:18.760 --> 00:27:25.280
I didn't think you could be so jealous.

212
00:27:25.440 --> 00:27:32.000
It was a nag ... I haven't been jealous!

213
00:27:32.160 --> 00:27:40.160
- You were the most jealous I've seen.
 - Then you haven't seen much, Gustav!

214
00:27:40.320 --> 00:27:48.160
You would have seen yourself recently.
 You were crazy angry.

215
00:27:48.320 --> 00:27:56.520
I wasn't angry.
 I was calm as a file bowl.
 No problem.

216
00:27:56.680 --> 00:28:04.520
I recognized your mine from this summer when I won over you in ping pong.

217
00:28:04.680 --> 00:28:11.040
You have never won over me in ping pong.

218
00:28:11.200 --> 00:28:17.720
-Yes.
 In two straight sets.
 -There are five-set matches that apply.

219
00:28:17.880 --> 00:28:23.600
- There you have no chance.
 –21–5, 21–6.

220
00:28:24.760 --> 00:28:28.200
21–7.

221
00:29:06.480 --> 00:29:08.520
