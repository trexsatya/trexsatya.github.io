1
00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:10.800
Shouldn't I cut myself soon?

2
00:00:10.960 --> 00:00:16.200
You can wait a bit.
 You fit in slightly longer hair.

3
00:00:16.360 --> 00:00:19.960
Do you think?
 Yes maybe.

4
00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:46.200
I have a tip for you.

5
00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:51.600
If you have a small slack wine left -

6
00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:59.760
- So you can take an ice tray and freeze the wine.

7
00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:05.000
Then you can use it for a wine sauce.

8
00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:13.080
Yes, may she live, yes, may she live!

9
00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:16.000
Congratulations!

10
00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:27.560
A coffee maker?

11
00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:33.520
We already have a coffee maker.

12
00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:41.200
We needed a bigger one at work so I changed.
 But this one works well.

13
00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:48.040
- The funnel is broken.
 - Yes, but you can fix that.

14
00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:56.600
Such a weather rabbits ... Check out here!

15
00:02:56.760 --> 00:03:04.240
Walk around with hanging ears, when it's so easy to lift in Estonia!

16
00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:07.440
And cheap is.

17
00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:20.280
- Is there any coffee?
 -Yes soon.

18
00:03:31.960 --> 00:03:34.760
One two three four!

19
00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:38.440
Orange plupp chance.

20
00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:44.400
What do the Scania call juice made on elderflower?

21
00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:51.240
- Shelf juice, is that saying your mom?
 - I have it on the tongue ...

22
00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:56.320
- It's shelf juice!
 - Are you from SkÃ¥ne?!

23
00:03:56.480 --> 00:04:00.120
No, you are from Flen!

24
00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:04.440
- What do you answer?
 -Say again.

25
00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:08.840
What do the Scania call juice made on elderflower?

26
00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:15.720
I have it ... what did mom say?
 "Now you'll get a glass ..."

27
00:04:15.880 --> 00:04:18.240
Mixed juice!

28
00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:21.840
The correct answer is shelf juice.

29
00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:30.320
Now we lost a plump!
 Well done!
 Well done.

30
00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:34.280
What is the name...

31
00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:37.600
Our question will go about!

32
00:04:37.760 --> 00:04:43.520
I knew the answer!
 You distracted me!

33
00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:49.320
- Release that!
 - What should I let go?
 The cup?

34
00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:52.840
Look now...

35
00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:58.960
Well ... now we have spilled too, and lost the plump.
 Are you happy now?

36
00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:06.840
Are you happy?
 First we lose, and then we spill.
 Great!

37
00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:12.840
Always when we play, we should spill and lose questions.
 This was successful!

38
00:05:39.960 --> 00:05:41.960
Your damn!

39
00:05:48.360 --> 00:05:53.160
- Why are you drying up?
 -It does not matter.

40
00:05:53.320 --> 00:05:56.920
Wipe up after you, Ulf!

41
00:05:57.080 --> 00:06:01.000
We start over, and change couples.

42
00:06:01.160 --> 00:06:05.600
- Then I want to be with you.
 - And me with Andreas.

43
00:06:05.760 --> 00:06:11.080
Then I can still be with Kristina.
 Thanks for that!

44
00:06:56.400 --> 00:06:59.760
Ulf, I can't sleep.

45
00:07:01.880 --> 00:07:05.720
Herb tea usually helps.

46
00:07:05.880 --> 00:07:09.080
I have been drinking two cups.

47
00:07:12.320 --> 00:07:17.560
If you do this ... you take a plastic bag.

48
00:07:20.840 --> 00:07:24.960
Then you pour in contact glue.

49
00:07:28.560 --> 00:07:32.520
You spray some glue in the bag.

50
00:07:34.160 --> 00:07:37.960
And then you pull in the vapors.

51
00:07:49.200 --> 00:07:53.000
Then you become very drowsy.

52
00:07:53.160 --> 00:07:55.960
I do not know...

53
00:07:57.040 --> 00:08:00.960
Drink a glass of warm milk, then.

54
00:08:03.800 --> 00:08:09.320
Yes ... maybe I'll try it.

55
00:08:14.960 --> 00:08:19.240
Do you see the old man?
 He probably has problems.

56
00:08:19.400 --> 00:08:25.320
- Is he drowning?
 -I do not know.
 What do you think?

57
00:08:25.480 --> 00:08:30.920
I don't look at this distance.
 I'm nearsighted.

58
00:08:31.080 --> 00:08:35.880
I can read, but at a distance I look blurred.

59
00:08:36.040 --> 00:08:42.000
It has come in recent years.
 I have not been to the optician.

60
00:08:42.160 --> 00:08:46.120
- You have glasses?
 - No, lentils.

61
00:08:46.280 --> 00:08:50.080
Get to see ... Yes, look!

62
00:08:50.240 --> 00:08:54.800
- You hardly see them.
 - No, that's the wrong strength.

63
00:08:54.960 --> 00:08:58.960
It's actually a pretty bad optician.

64
00:08:59.120 --> 00:09:01.960
It's sad ...

65
00:09:02.120 --> 00:09:05.960
It's wrong you in the wrong place!

66
00:09:09.480 --> 00:09:14.160
What are feminists against these magazines?

67
00:09:14.320 --> 00:09:19.000
It's almost just girls in the pictures!

68
00:09:21.880 --> 00:09:27.960
-What's that?
 -A hate paw.
 My happiness amulet.

69
00:09:28.120 --> 00:09:33.760
It is important to have one.
 I go nowhere without this one.

70
00:09:35.720 --> 00:09:41.400
- It gives you lucky?
 - Yes, maybe not in terms of brides ...

71
00:09:41.560 --> 00:09:47.360
- It's pretty big to carry with you.
 - It is worth it if it protects!

72
00:09:52.400 --> 00:09:55.640
This is too sad!

73
00:09:55.800 --> 00:09:59.000
Now Lundberg and Super sit again.

74
00:09:59.160 --> 00:10:04.120
It's only a month since he lost the job!

75
00:10:04.280 --> 00:10:09.640
Look!
 Now he falls asleep over his bag with strong beer.

76
00:10:09.800 --> 00:10:14.200
It hurts me.
 You should do something!

77
00:10:14.360 --> 00:10:17.800
Yes, go and get the strong beer, you.

78
00:10:17.960 --> 00:10:20.960
Surely we have peanuts at home?

79
00:10:36.080 --> 00:10:41.160
-How is it going?
 - I feel like a treasure!

80
00:10:41.320 --> 00:10:45.840
No, it's really nice.
 Fresh.

81
00:10:47.560 --> 00:10:52.240
I'm glad I smoke!
 Imagine if I had sniffed.

82
00:10:52.400 --> 00:10:58.200
Girls who sniff are as disgusting as guys baking!

83
00:10:58.360 --> 00:11:00.840
I'll take these.

84
00:11:01.840 --> 00:11:06.840
You there!
 In the green bathing pants, yes.

85
00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:12.400
Run and pick up my cig on the desk!

86
00:11:12.560 --> 00:11:15.600
Otherwise, you may leave the bath.

87
00:11:16.920 --> 00:11:24.600
- Now they are on the little kid again.
 - The little thick?
 Now they chase him!

88
00:11:24.760 --> 00:11:29.720
- They are on him every day!
 - He doesn't have it easy.

89
00:11:29.880 --> 00:11:32.760
Now they hold him underwater.

90
00:11:32.920 --> 00:11:38.040
- Children can be stupid.
 - And no adult intervenes!

91
00:11:39.040 --> 00:11:43.160
-Thanks.
 - Do you offer?

92
00:12:09.360 --> 00:12:14.640
-Hello!
 I want to go by bus.
 - Tjugo crowns, thank you.

93
00:12:16.240 --> 00:12:21.400
- Can I get a ticket of you?
 -Where!

94
00:12:22.840 --> 00:12:25.360
Thanks.

95
00:12:31.200 --> 00:12:35.840
Yeah ... Now we're probably running soon.

96
00:12:37.480 --> 00:12:40.600
Anytime...

97
00:12:44.920 --> 00:12:49.920
-How is it going?
 - It almost feels like a uniform.

98
00:12:52.680 --> 00:12:58.280
But if you unbutton a button?
 Look, how nice it was!

99
00:13:00.040 --> 00:13:07.360
All animals are equal, but some animals are more equal than others.

100
00:13:07.520 --> 00:13:13.960
A quote from the animal farm by George Orwell, which we will talk about today.

101
00:13:14.120 --> 00:13:19.120
Hi, my name is Gunnar.
 Welcome to the book circle.

102
00:13:20.520 --> 00:13:23.640
-What's your name?
 - Jim.

103
00:13:23.800 --> 00:13:26.840
Can you describe the book?

104
00:13:28.040 --> 00:13:31.640
It is white.

105
00:13:31.800 --> 00:13:35.120
Can you say anything about the content?

106
00:13:36.160 --> 00:13:40.720
Eh ... there are no pictures in it.

107
00:13:42.840 --> 00:13:47.360
The animals on a farmhouse feel oppressed by the farmer.

108
00:13:47.520 --> 00:13:50.800
They take over power-

109
00:13:50.960 --> 00:13:56.400
- But the new system will soon become as corrupt as the old one.

110
00:13:56.560 --> 00:13:59.360
Comments?

111
00:14:00.240 --> 00:14:04.560
- I thought it was unreal.
 -What do you mean?

112
00:14:04.720 --> 00:14:09.240
It was unrealistic that the animals could talk.

113
00:14:09.400 --> 00:14:13.680
Yes, but it was probably a conscious choice.

114
00:14:13.840 --> 00:14:18.840
How many people perceived the book as an allegory?

115
00:14:22.360 --> 00:14:25.400
It's an allegory.

116
00:14:25.560 --> 00:14:30.200
The character Napoleon, is he a metaphor?

117
00:14:30.360 --> 00:14:33.320
No, a pig.

118
00:14:33.480 --> 00:14:36.680
Yes, but also a metaphor for Stalin.

119
00:14:36.840 --> 00:14:42.920
The entire animal farm is a metaphor for totalitarian Soviet communism.

120
00:14:44.040 --> 00:14:47.600
Anyone have a question?

121
00:14:49.480 --> 00:14:53.000
Is it ok if I go to the bathroom?

122
00:14:53.160 --> 00:14:55.520
Sure.

123
00:15:04.880 --> 00:15:08.640
Two simple espresso.

124
00:15:08.800 --> 00:15:12.000
I take a blueberry muffin.

125
00:15:12.160 --> 00:15:17.400
- It's been a long time since I traveled.
 - You get away too rarely.

126
00:15:17.560 --> 00:15:23.200
How much does it cost to go to London a weekend?
 Not many kronor.

127
00:15:23.360 --> 00:15:29.080
No, sometimes it is cheaper than traveling within Sweden.

128
00:15:33.240 --> 00:15:35.280
Thanks.

129
00:15:35.440 --> 00:15:38.440
You should really treat that.

130
00:16:10.440 --> 00:16:16.120
Okay.
 You have all had to choose each favorite piece from the animal farm.

131
00:16:16.280 --> 00:16:20.160
Jim, can you read what you chose?

132
00:16:20.320 --> 00:16:26.120
-Rather not.
 -Okay.
 There is no coercion.

133
00:16:26.280 --> 00:16:31.600
Gunilla ... Which paragraph have you chosen?

134
00:16:31.760 --> 00:16:37.600
Nothing.
 I was going to sing the song World Wide Web by Nick Borgen.

135
00:16:39.720 --> 00:16:45.080
World Wide Web, World Wide Web

136
00:16:45.240 --> 00:16:48.160
I feel happy, here is no stress

137
00:16:48.320 --> 00:16:51.080
Here's my new home address

138
00:16:53.560 --> 00:16:55.560
Thanks.

139
00:17:02.280 --> 00:17:05.040
That is enough for today.

140
00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:22.320
Excuse me, I would just take that apple.
 Can you give me that?

141
00:17:22.480 --> 00:17:26.240
Okay.
 Let's go!

142
00:17:26.400 --> 00:17:32.240
You are big in the trout, dear, but now it is the turn of the fists!

143
00:17:32.400 --> 00:17:38.440
Here is Mr. Aj and Mrs. Pain.
 They have been meeting with you!

144
00:17:38.600 --> 00:17:41.560
Let's Get Ready to Rumble!

145
00:17:43.280 --> 00:17:46.160
Ouch!

146
00:17:47.200 --> 00:17:52.200
Are you crazy?
 What kind of man are you?

147
00:17:55.600 --> 00:18:02.120
You, what is the name of the swim?
 Do you see him with a white bath cap?

148
00:18:02.280 --> 00:18:07.400
-Do you mean like this...?
 - No, more so ...

149
00:18:08.440 --> 00:18:12.440
-No clue.
 -Neither do I.

150
00:18:14.840 --> 00:18:18.440
-I am going in.
 - We have just drank up!

151
00:18:18.600 --> 00:18:22.640
How long should we wait?
 20 minutes?

152
00:18:27.320 --> 00:18:32.880
The Rejv Parts will realize that we are cops!

153
00:18:33.880 --> 00:18:37.680
No, it's "under cover"!

154
00:18:53.480 --> 00:18:56.200
Hi, it's Lukas.

155
00:18:57.720 --> 00:19:02.560
-Hello.
 Per.
 - We have long -distance guests ...

156
00:19:02.720 --> 00:19:07.520
-Nice to meet you.
 - Conny here is Taliban.

157
00:19:10.440 --> 00:19:13.160
Hello.
 Per.

158
00:19:14.160 --> 00:19:17.240
There is a good atmosphere in here!

159
00:19:18.520 --> 00:19:24.720
It's been a nice day.
 The rain never came.

160
00:19:24.880 --> 00:19:30.280
You have to take the forecasts with a pinch of salt.

161
00:19:31.320 --> 00:19:36.680
But otherwise, so ... It's a nice time now.

162
00:19:38.760 --> 00:19:46.040
They said on the radio that it would be sunny tomorrow, upwards of 18 degrees.

163
00:19:47.040 --> 00:19:51.520
The radio usually predicts better than TV.

164
00:19:51.680 --> 00:19:56.400
TV is not the same since Pohlman quit.

165
00:19:56.560 --> 00:20:02.760
- He would love to have a funny grunt ... - Yes, he was fun!

166
00:20:04.680 --> 00:20:10.120
- Do you live nearby?
 -Yes, in a southern terrain villa.

167
00:20:10.280 --> 00:20:14.200
You should meet the wife.
 - British!

168
00:20:15.920 --> 00:20:20.080
-Hello.
 Britt.
 -Per.

169
00:20:34.200 --> 00:20:38.720
Excuse.
 You sit in my place.

170
00:20:38.880 --> 00:20:44.320
-Do I?
 - Yes, I was just at Dass.

171
00:20:44.480 --> 00:20:47.280
I apologize.

172
00:20:50.760 --> 00:20:56.280
- Think after a little next time.
 - I didn't know you were sitting there.

173
00:20:56.440 --> 00:21:01.080
-Excuse?
 - I didn't know you were sitting there.

174
00:21:01.240 --> 00:21:07.000
Okay!
 Let's go.
 You and I.
 Here and now.
 Come on!

175
00:21:08.040 --> 00:21:12.160
-What do you mean?
 - It's not so strange.

176
00:21:12.320 --> 00:21:15.800
You muck with me.
 I give you a strike.

177
00:21:15.960 --> 00:21:20.480
- I don't intend to fight.
 - You would have thought about that before!

178
00:21:20.640 --> 00:21:26.040
Now the smack train rolls!
 I offer a knuckle sandwich.

179
00:21:26.200 --> 00:21:31.000
Two slices stroke with a little bang in between.
 Come on!

180
00:21:31.160 --> 00:21:34.080
Stop it...

181
00:21:34.240 --> 00:21:40.600
The train to Strymberga!
 We stay in blue, leg crackers and nasal bleeding.

182
00:21:41.600 --> 00:21:45.120
Come on!
 You are big, but slow!

183
00:21:45.280 --> 00:21:50.160
I float like a butterfly, I stick like a bee ...

184
00:21:50.320 --> 00:21:56.400
Aoo!
 How hurt it does!
 Are you crazy?

185
00:21:56.560 --> 00:22:00.560
- Have you lived there for a long time?
 -Awhile.

186
00:22:00.720 --> 00:22:05.680
-Where are you from?
 - Lomma.

187
00:22:05.840 --> 00:22:11.840
We are really from Afghanistan, but have lived here for 1 1/2 years.

188
00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:17.480
- It's not that long.
 - No, but you get into it quickly.

189
00:22:17.640 --> 00:22:20.200
But don't you miss the home areas?

190
00:22:20.360 --> 00:22:25.720
No, we never fit into Lomma.

191
00:22:25.880 --> 00:22:29.280
There were strange types there.

192
00:22:29.440 --> 00:22:34.680
- I mean Afghanistan.
 - No, it was much like Lomma ...

193
00:22:34.840 --> 00:22:37.480
... firmly warmer.

194
00:22:41.200 --> 00:22:44.560
We don't play TP tonight!

195
00:22:44.720 --> 00:22:48.240
You may start talking about something else.

196
00:22:51.720 --> 00:22:54.440
Tp!
 Tp!

197
00:22:55.440 --> 00:22:57.760
Tp!
 Tp!

198
00:23:08.640 --> 00:23:14.480
- I am treasurer in the hockey club.
 - You can also become association -active!

199
00:23:14.640 --> 00:23:20.040
- It's not much to talk about.
 - Lite secret ...

200
00:23:20.200 --> 00:23:27.720
We are a bunch of guys who want to take over the world.
 Rotary is called.

201
00:23:34.360 --> 00:23:37.200
What 'fuck are you doing?

202
00:23:37.360 --> 00:23:40.760
After all, you stand and push me!

203
00:23:40.920 --> 00:23:43.440
Sorry.

204
00:23:43.600 --> 00:23:46.920
Sorry?
 Okay!

205
00:23:48.200 --> 00:23:51.280
Here we go!
 Come on!

206
00:23:51.440 --> 00:23:57.120
In normal cases I do not beat women but I can make an exception.

207
00:23:57.280 --> 00:24:05.000
I don't want to give you a hit.
 I didn't want to dance, but you offered!

208
00:24:05.160 --> 00:24:07.960
Relax a little.

209
00:24:08.120 --> 00:24:14.080
Congratulations!
 You have won at Stryktipset.
 Award ceremony!

210
00:24:14.240 --> 00:24:21.200
What time is it?
 The big pointer stands on the bang, the little one on the rod.

211
00:24:28.760 --> 00:24:35.600
Come on!
 You get first free.
 You get a free stroke!
 Put this one!

212
00:24:48.720 --> 00:24:54.320
That was very nice!
 I did such a foil loops -

213
00:24:54.480 --> 00:24:57.680
- And it was a nice shade!

214
00:24:57.840 --> 00:25:03.240
If you ask me about future dreams ...

215
00:25:03.400 --> 00:25:07.720
I would like to go to Dalhalla -

216
00:25:07.880 --> 00:25:13.360
âAnd look at Robert Wells with "Rhapsody in Rock".

217
00:25:13.520 --> 00:25:18.280
And so I want all Americans to burn in hell.

218
00:25:19.280 --> 00:25:21.880
That's what I want.

219
00:25:57.120 --> 00:26:01.120
You ... Do you think I'm boring?

220
00:26:01.280 --> 00:26:08.120
I'm not very funny, but I try to be happy anyway.

221
00:26:10.400 --> 00:26:17.800
I feel that I am stuck in a role - Magnus, the boring.

222
00:26:19.280 --> 00:26:24.680
It's not me.
 Yes, I am, but ...

223
00:26:24.840 --> 00:26:28.240
If you take Peter at my job ...

224
00:26:28.400 --> 00:26:33.560
When he tells things, people listen, because he is so funny.

225
00:26:33.720 --> 00:26:42.000
But why do you have to be so damn funny?
 That's not the most important thing.

226
00:26:42.160 --> 00:26:48.400
It is important to be interesting.
 I try to be ...

227
00:26:48.560 --> 00:26:55.480
... when I tell things.
 Don't you think I can be interesting?

228
00:26:58.120 --> 00:27:01.120
Frida ...

229
00:27:32.280 --> 00:27:34.920
