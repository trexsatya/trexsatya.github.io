1
00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:57.560
The space industry will intervene in everything.

2
00:00:58.880 --> 00:01:05.600
The problems with resources and quality of life here on earth are the same as in space.

3
00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:17.200
When we get something to work in space, it is useful here on earth as well.

4
00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:44.840
Space research requires sustainable systems - which can be used here as well.

5
00:02:56.800 --> 00:02:59.680
The main product is called Solein.

6
00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:06.480
Solein is natural, for our organism is an unmodified gift from nature.

7
00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:09.440
Nature has given us this.

8
00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:15.000
The nutritional composition is also reminiscent of the one we naturally get in us.

9
00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:56.960
You get a powder that corresponds to dried meat or dried carrot or soy.

10
00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:35.360
Manufacturing requires electricity and air.

11
00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:42.480
Electricity is found worldwide, both as wind power and solar energy.

12
00:04:42.640 --> 00:04:49.040
With direct air capture we also get water and carbon dioxide everywhere.

13
00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:03.120
There we will have an apparatus for direct air capture.

14
00:05:03.280 --> 00:05:09.880
We capture the carbon dioxide and use in food production.

15
00:05:10.040 --> 00:05:18.200
In the future, we can also achieve this in, for example, shopping centers.

16
00:05:41.960 --> 00:05:49.240
Singapore is a place where new food technology is welcomed.

17
00:05:49.400 --> 00:05:54.920
It is the place on earth where new technology is taken in commercial use first.

18
00:05:55.080 --> 00:06:00.440
It is also Singapore's goal and stated strategy.

19
00:06:00.600 --> 00:06:03.840
The situation is reminiscent of that in space.

20
00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:10.960
You are short of space and have to streamline food production.

21
00:06:11.120 --> 00:06:17.200
And we can literally produce food in the middle of the city!

22
00:06:43.840 --> 00:06:49.480
We use waste products that are already in the space environment.

23
00:06:49.640 --> 00:06:56.840
For example, the carbon dioxide we capture.
 It has breathed out of the astronauts.

24
00:07:32.680 --> 00:07:36.400
The powder will probably not be the end product.

25
00:07:36.560 --> 00:07:40.720
A powder is difficult to handle in microgravitation.

26
00:07:40.880 --> 00:07:48.280
We are thinking of a mixture of water and solein, as in a protein shake.

27
00:07:58.080 --> 00:08:02.360
Space research can also be important for the earth.

28
00:08:02.520 --> 00:08:08.560
We can create self -governing appliances, perhaps in container size -

29
00:08:08.720 --> 00:08:13.400
- For use in refugee camps and in places with inadequate logistics.

30
00:08:18.920 --> 00:08:21.840
-How does it taste?
 - Top!

31
00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:25.800
This is also important -

32
00:08:25.960 --> 00:08:32.800
- For a third of our greenhouse gas emissions depends on what we eat.

33
00:08:32.960 --> 00:08:39.160
Food technology can solve the biggest environmental problem here on earth.

34
00:08:56.120 --> 00:08:58.840
Mushrooms are fascinating!

35
00:08:59.960 --> 00:09:05.560
The sponge pest is huge!
 Therefore, there are so many different types of fungi.

36
00:09:17.200 --> 00:09:21.000
Here we found a nice resistance!

37
00:09:28.320 --> 00:09:34.560
These are Pleurotus mushrooms.
 Such are decomposers.

38
00:09:34.720 --> 00:09:41.160
So they break down organic material.
 It makes them a good space candidate.

39
00:09:41.320 --> 00:09:46.600
If they receive nutrition, it is converted into protein and nutritious fungi.

40
00:10:16.600 --> 00:10:22.440
When we have picked mushrooms we usually take a spore print.

41
00:10:22.600 --> 00:10:26.520
Mu Mycology came into being when we started growing mushrooms.

42
00:10:26.680 --> 00:10:31.800
In a farm you have a place and can grow a lot of mushrooms.

43
00:10:31.960 --> 00:10:34.440
Waste can be composted.

44
00:10:34.600 --> 00:10:40.840
But say that you are in a food desert or in space.

45
00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:48.320
Then the space becomes very important and the waste becomes crucial.

46
00:10:48.480 --> 00:10:51.760
Mu Mycology was a way -

47
00:10:51.920 --> 00:10:56.680
- Getting mushrooms on a very small surface.

48
00:10:56.840 --> 00:11:01.040
It went up a light for us:

49
00:11:01.200 --> 00:11:08.280
"We can increase the return!"
 Then we started growing in the garage.

50
00:11:58.760 --> 00:12:03.920
This is another reason why mushrooms are good space food.

51
00:12:04.080 --> 00:12:09.080
They are constantly different.
 There are many different varieties.

52
00:12:09.240 --> 00:12:17.080
They taste so different, but still give the vitamins, minerals and amino acids -

53
00:12:17.240 --> 00:12:20.520
- As the astronauts will need.

54
00:12:20.680 --> 00:12:24.520
- How old is it?
 - Four months, type.

55
00:12:24.680 --> 00:12:27.720
-Seriously?
 - Yeah!

56
00:12:36.680 --> 00:12:41.120
We do not eat as much fungus in our society.

57
00:12:41.280 --> 00:12:47.840
But it would be valuable, because it is an overlooked food group.

58
00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:51.200
The substrate is the same as for everything else.

59
00:12:58.520 --> 00:13:03.880
You can ignore the smallest.
 They have no ...

60
00:13:04.040 --> 00:13:10.560
It is interesting that the mushrooms have been around for so long.
 It is an old kingdom.

61
00:13:10.720 --> 00:13:17.600
We know some really old colonies.
 Some are around 5,000 years old.

62
00:13:18.960 --> 00:13:24.640
They must be quite resistant, so they may grow even in space -

63
00:13:24.800 --> 00:13:30.000
- The solar radiation and the extreme environment.

64
00:13:30.160 --> 00:13:33.080
Have a nice meal!

65
00:13:35.920 --> 00:13:37.920
Pretty good, actually.

66
00:14:29.760 --> 00:14:36.080
IAEA's plant breeding takes place with the UN Food and Agricultural Organization.

67
00:14:36.240 --> 00:14:41.800
We will help member states with the return in agriculture.

68
00:14:41.960 --> 00:14:45.880
The plant breeding takes on grain production.

69
00:14:46.040 --> 00:14:51.720
The return of the crop must be improved or stabilized.

70
00:14:51.880 --> 00:14:58.400
And climate change and illness must be opposed.

71
00:15:15.480 --> 00:15:19.680
If you want to get different varieties -

72
00:15:19.840 --> 00:15:23.680
â€” Which in any way is better than before-

73
00:15:23.840 --> 00:15:27.720
- You have to evoke mutations.

74
00:15:27.880 --> 00:15:32.240
Then we make selection for the desired property.

75
00:15:32.400 --> 00:15:37.400
We also try to preserve all the good qualities that have been there before.

76
00:15:37.560 --> 00:15:42.320
It is only when there is a development pressure on an organism -

77
00:15:42.480 --> 00:15:46.400
- As it will develop.

78
00:15:46.560 --> 00:15:50.840
In the end, a variety has been produced that the farmer can grow.

79
00:16:54.240 --> 00:16:58.800
Our colleagues in China have been doing this for a while.

80
00:16:58.960 --> 00:17:06.520
They sent seeds from hundreds of species ... It was in 2008.

81
00:17:06.680 --> 00:17:12.200
The satellite revolved around the earth for 15 days and then returned.

82
00:17:12.360 --> 00:17:14.840
They use the seeds.

83
00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:21.080
But the big breakthrough is a wheat variety grown in China now.

84
00:17:21.240 --> 00:17:28.160
It is the second most common variety in China, and it is developed in space.

85
00:17:53.920 --> 00:17:58.920
Something that is important in this context is -

86
00:17:59.080 --> 00:18:04.920
- That we should have abolished hunger by 2030. Is it possible?

87
00:18:05.080 --> 00:18:10.560
We all strive in that direction.
 This applies to all countries.

88
00:18:10.720 --> 00:18:18.040
Techniques such as mutation processing are important, because they are so available.

89
00:18:18.200 --> 00:18:24.400
And they provide the genetic variation that an improved variety requires.

90
00:18:35.080 --> 00:18:42.440
He asked if, when I doctorate, I could help poor farmers.

91
00:18:43.760 --> 00:18:49.400
I promised him to do it, to help the farmers.

92
00:18:49.560 --> 00:18:52.720
I have never regretted.

93
00:19:44.240 --> 00:19:48.560
Radiation, microgravitation and vibrations ...

94
00:19:48.720 --> 00:19:53.040
Everything affects plants - and spring - biology.

95
00:19:53.200 --> 00:19:59.200
We investigate whether it can provide benefits, especially in inhospitable environments:

96
00:19:59.360 --> 00:20:04.640
Salt, warm or dry.
 We want to take advantage of it.

97
00:20:04.800 --> 00:20:11.320
We want to turn to the desert spread and secure our future here.

98
00:20:28.760 --> 00:20:31.920
The United Arab Emirates are looking ahead.

99
00:20:32.080 --> 00:20:36.160
Although the oil has been helpful, you look forward -

100
00:20:36.320 --> 00:20:43.560
- And wants to understand which industries will be important in the 50-100 year term.

101
00:20:43.720 --> 00:20:49.760
This region is also expected to gain the world's highest population growth.

102
00:20:49.920 --> 00:20:53.120
This is also the largest in the cities -

103
00:20:53.280 --> 00:21:00.640
- Where you have far to agriculture.
 Therefore, space was interesting.

104
00:21:00.800 --> 00:21:06.840
The United Arab Emirates have reached a long way in the space area.

105
00:22:09.480 --> 00:22:16.600
These green beans have grown in simulated Mars soil, these in ordinary soil.

106
00:22:16.760 --> 00:22:23.400
They look the same, although the control plant in plain pot soil is a little larger.

107
00:22:23.560 --> 00:22:27.600
It has much bigger roots.
 You can see that clearly.

108
00:22:27.760 --> 00:22:31.520
Ordinary soil gives greater harvest.

109
00:22:31.680 --> 00:22:36.160
But this one also gives nice beans.

110
00:22:36.320 --> 00:22:42.800
However, the harvest becomes a little smaller.
 We want to improve it and get the same return.

111
00:22:43.920 --> 00:22:48.120
We can grow over 25 different species right now.

112
00:22:48.280 --> 00:22:51.720
The potatoes are doing really well.

113
00:22:51.880 --> 00:22:58.600
It looks like regular potatoes and does not differ at all from it.

114
00:22:58.760 --> 00:23:03.360
It does well, as long as it gets fertilizer.

115
00:23:03.520 --> 00:23:10.000
Fertilizers are needed, because the soil lacks both nitrate and ammonia.

116
00:23:10.160 --> 00:23:16.560
Requires.
 But as long as we can provide it, everything works well.

117
00:23:33.160 --> 00:23:40.440
The regional on Mars lacks things like nitrogen and phosphorus.

118
00:23:40.600 --> 00:23:45.320
We were going to bring it with us when we are going to colonize Mars.

119
00:23:45.480 --> 00:23:51.640
But then space goes to other use.

120
00:23:51.800 --> 00:23:59.160
Instead, we take advantage of something we already have - in our urine and stool.

121
00:23:59.320 --> 00:24:05.520
They are full of nutrients for the plants.
 That is the idea of the experiment here.

122
00:24:05.680 --> 00:24:09.240
We will use our kiss and poop.

123
00:24:09.400 --> 00:24:13.400
I remember grandfather doing it.

124
00:24:13.560 --> 00:24:21.680
Once a year he gathered everything and spread it over the horticulture.

125
00:24:21.840 --> 00:24:28.480
We saw what he had done, because it stuck out pieces of toilet paper.

126
00:24:28.640 --> 00:24:32.160
Own vegetables on your own kiss and poop ...

127
00:25:34.600 --> 00:25:40.920
Hope we can apply lessons from the Mars and Moon experiments here-

128
00:25:41.080 --> 00:25:44.240
- And make agriculture circular again.

129
00:25:44.400 --> 00:25:48.040
It is an important goal for 2050.

130
00:25:48.200 --> 00:25:53.920
Now it is not circular.
 We use resources from other parts of the world.

131
00:25:54.080 --> 00:25:57.240
We end them over there.

132
00:25:57.400 --> 00:26:02.840
It also causes problems here, because nature is suffering from it.

133
00:26:03.000 --> 00:26:07.320
I hope agriculture will be circular again by 2050-

134
00:26:07.480 --> 00:26:12.560
- And that we should know what it takes to get rid of it.

135
00:26:14.920 --> 00:26:17.840
Growing crops is not enough.

136
00:26:18.000 --> 00:26:24.440
You never eat everything.
 You only eat the tomato, not the leaves and roots.

137
00:26:24.600 --> 00:26:31.960
They must be recycled and allowed to be included in the cycle again.
 Nothing may be lost.

138
00:27:19.360 --> 00:27:23.200
It is about 9 milligrams per liter.

139
00:28:33.040 --> 00:28:40.160
Every square centimeter aboard a space shuttle is a major investment.

140
00:28:40.320 --> 00:28:43.920
We are the ones who can offer a solution -

141
00:28:44.080 --> 00:28:49.040
â€“So that astronauts can minimize the space required on board -

142
00:28:49.200 --> 00:28:55.640
- And also the amount of water and the lighting.

143
00:28:55.800 --> 00:29:00.200
A settlement on Mars must be completely enclosed.

144
00:29:00.360 --> 00:29:04.280
Then the space must be utilized optimally.

145
00:29:12.040 --> 00:29:18.080
We let the system provide each of the four astronauts -

146
00:29:18.240 --> 00:29:23.920
- With 150-200 grams daily of leafy vegetables and leaf shoots.

147
00:29:24.080 --> 00:29:30.880
The average production is 16-20 kilos per 28 days.

148
00:29:31.040 --> 00:29:35.560
The one who is allowed to work with plants and touch them-

149
00:29:35.720 --> 00:29:39.520
- Keeps closer to the planet he lacks.

150
00:29:39.680 --> 00:29:45.600
Outside in space, the earth is hardly getting closer than this.

151
00:30:06.600 --> 00:30:13.880
This technology requires no long -haul supplements from coast to coast.

152
00:30:14.040 --> 00:30:19.240
And you avoid pesticides in the food.
 You know what you have grown.

153
00:30:19.400 --> 00:30:24.520
Most people live in city apartments now and have no garden -

154
00:30:24.680 --> 00:30:28.280
-So this is a solution for the 21st century.

155
00:30:42.040 --> 00:30:45.920
-One week to go.
 - Yes, then it's harvest.

156
00:30:46.080 --> 00:30:50.920
- I don't realize that they survived.
 - This is higher up.

157
00:30:51.080 --> 00:30:53.920
One week to harvest.

158
00:30:54.080 --> 00:30:56.960
The head is really beautiful ...

159
00:30:57.120 --> 00:31:02.840
The last few years have been a challenge with all the rain.

160
00:31:03.000 --> 00:31:10.000
It has forced us to rethink.
 We have changed variety, to compensate for the climate.

161
00:31:10.160 --> 00:31:16.840
It has been too wet or cold - and too hot and dry during the dry season.

162
00:31:22.880 --> 00:31:26.240
These plants require a predictable climate.

163
00:31:26.400 --> 00:31:31.000
Climate change affects food safety.

164
00:31:31.160 --> 00:31:36.880
How should we support the population after the population explosion?

165
00:31:37.040 --> 00:31:43.800
We have had to use the earth.
 After all, we had to survive.

166
00:31:43.960 --> 00:31:49.440
But in the future, we must try to make ourselves independent of the cultivation land.

167
00:31:49.600 --> 00:31:53.040
Then we do not waste on non-renewable resources-

168
00:31:53.200 --> 00:31:56.720
- As fertilizer, work and soil.

169
00:31:56.880 --> 00:32:03.600
In this way, we get more of a circular economy, rather than a linear economy.

170
00:32:03.760 --> 00:32:10.760
The products should no longer become waste but be seen as raw materials again.

171
00:32:10.920 --> 00:32:18.440
In space you have to use what you have.
 Same thing here on earth.

172
00:32:18.600 --> 00:32:25.400
When we get something to work in space, it is useful here on earth as well.

173
00:32:26.320 --> 00:32:32.800
Agricultural technology and space provide a product that gives us food safety.

174
00:32:34.560 --> 00:32:39.120
Take a look at the appliances you use.
 Start with the microwave.

175
00:32:39.280 --> 00:32:42.440
And so the GPS and the mobile.

176
00:32:42.600 --> 00:32:48.160
Everything was meant for space, but then it came into use here on earth.

177
00:32:48.320 --> 00:32:53.560
This is how the technological development works: it is enough for space, it is enough for the earth.

178
00:33:19.200 --> 00:33:25.320
In Thailand we have used this plant for a hundred years maybe.

179
00:33:25.480 --> 00:33:30.160
In northern and northeastern Thailand it is used as a vegetable.

180
00:33:30.320 --> 00:33:38.160
No other plant grows so fast, so you quickly get a large volume.

181
00:33:38.320 --> 00:33:44.840
It was seen that the plant contains everything we need to need.

182
00:34:17.840 --> 00:34:23.880
Good!
 The omelette gets some texture from this.

183
00:34:24.040 --> 00:34:30.520
If you tell us what dwarf food is and how nutritious it is -

184
00:34:30.680 --> 00:34:33.240
- So it can be popular.

185
00:35:17.480 --> 00:35:23.280
The goal is to understand ... If in the future we want to grow a plant on a giant plane -

186
00:35:23.440 --> 00:35:30.200
- As Jupiter, we must understand how it reacts to hypergravity.

187
00:35:41.200 --> 00:35:47.480
We have great diversity among the plants and a good set of varieties.

188
00:35:47.640 --> 00:35:52.720
If we select a certain plant that fits in space context -

189
00:35:52.880 --> 00:35:56.840
- Can Thailand become a leader in space cultivation.

190
00:35:57.000 --> 00:36:04.000
Space research provides innovations, because it makes it impossible.

191
00:36:04.160 --> 00:36:09.040
We have to think new to survive in space.

192
00:36:09.200 --> 00:36:13.680
We must find ways to grow plants on other planets.

193
00:36:13.840 --> 00:36:18.480
And they can be adapted to places on earth -

194
00:36:18.640 --> 00:36:25.800
- As a desert environment or extreme places like the South and North Pole ...

195
00:36:25.960 --> 00:36:32.720
Then we can produce food there and people can benefit from space technology.

196
00:37:21.400 --> 00:37:28.000
We insert the cells into a bioreactor, a tank with the right growth opportunities.

197
00:37:28.160 --> 00:37:32.400
You do not need to breed a whole cow.

198
00:37:32.560 --> 00:37:37.440
You only grow the parts that you will eat.

199
00:37:39.320 --> 00:37:47.120
Climate change affects food safety and vice versa.

200
00:37:47.280 --> 00:37:51.440
When you need more food and consume more resources -

201
00:37:51.600 --> 00:37:56.920
- Then you get problems with things like deforestation and water use.

202
00:37:57.080 --> 00:38:02.440
It affects climate change.
 It becomes a vicious circle.

203
00:38:02.600 --> 00:38:05.600
To put a stop to it-

204
00:38:05.760 --> 00:38:11.360
â€“Com by reducing resource consumption in food production -

205
00:38:11.520 --> 00:38:14.880
- Should reduce climate change.

206
00:38:29.360 --> 00:38:34.200
Singapore is open to innovations and new technology.

207
00:38:34.360 --> 00:38:39.280
The reason is that you need to find alternative solutions -

208
00:38:39.440 --> 00:38:45.880
- As a result of the limited area for meat production in Singapore.

209
00:38:46.040 --> 00:38:49.840
Growing meat is just the right technology.

210
00:38:50.000 --> 00:38:54.360
They can use the cells we send from Israel-

211
00:38:54.520 --> 00:39:00.840
- With some ingredients from Singapore, without having to breed the entire animal.

212
00:39:23.120 --> 00:39:26.160
Aleph Zero gives us the opportunity -

213
00:39:26.320 --> 00:39:32.360
- To work for closed cycles and the abolition of waste.

214
00:39:32.520 --> 00:39:39.560
We can bring with us lessons and start growing meat here as well on earth.

215
00:40:41.440 --> 00:40:45.240
We install the stem cells in the chip -

216
00:40:45.400 --> 00:40:50.000
â€“And agree with the right nutrients and temperature -

217
00:40:50.160 --> 00:40:55.480
- For the tissue culture from Aleph Farms.

218
00:40:56.600 --> 00:41:02.240
The equipment will fit in this little box.
 Everything weighs 3.4 kilos.

219
00:41:16.560 --> 00:41:21.160
There are actually a number of fossils confirming ...

220
00:41:21.320 --> 00:41:27.920
... that the first plants and even the animals here on earth ...

221
00:41:28.080 --> 00:41:32.040
... originates from microalgae.

222
00:41:32.200 --> 00:41:37.960
How about that?
 The microalgers are the origin of all living organisms.

223
00:41:38.120 --> 00:41:43.080
This means that all the necessary nutrients can be found there.

224
00:41:43.240 --> 00:41:47.720
Who?
 Fatty acids.
 Omega-3: DHA, EPA.

225
00:41:47.880 --> 00:41:52.560
All essential amino acids.
 The body cannot synthesize them.

226
00:41:52.720 --> 00:41:59.040
Lutein.
 Chlorophyll.
 Astaxantin.
 It is also about vitamins.

227
00:42:42.440 --> 00:42:48.760
When growth is over, we make them a powder.
 We dry them.

228
00:42:48.920 --> 00:42:53.720
It works just like a protein powder on earth.

229
00:42:53.880 --> 00:42:56.680
It is possible to have milkshake.

230
00:42:56.840 --> 00:43:02.080
You can make tofu of it, on board the vehicle, with the right equipment.

231
00:43:05.320 --> 00:43:12.880
A bioreactor agrees with an environment where the microorganisms can grow well.

232
00:43:13.040 --> 00:43:18.440
In our reactors, for example, we control the temperature -

233
00:43:18.600 --> 00:43:24.160
â€“And how much oxygen and carbon dioxide are available.

234
00:43:24.320 --> 00:43:28.240
What you see here is how we imagine -

235
00:43:28.400 --> 00:43:36.280
- The astronauts should be able to grow our microalgers with such a bioreactor.

236
00:43:36.440 --> 00:43:44.440
If we can grow food even on another planet and in the small spacecraft -

237
00:43:44.600 --> 00:43:49.840
- How would it work to grow food here on earth?

238
00:43:50.000 --> 00:43:55.280
Here we could make it extremely sustainable and also effective.

239
00:44:28.160 --> 00:44:30.280
Singapore is small.

240
00:44:30.440 --> 00:44:36.720
Food research and biotechnology will outweigh the lack of space.

241
00:44:36.880 --> 00:44:41.480
Given that, we have devoted ourselves to proteins and microorganisms -

242
00:44:41.640 --> 00:44:45.720
- To gain access to proteins in the future.

243
00:44:52.720 --> 00:44:56.760
My family has been Buddhists for four generations.

244
00:44:56.920 --> 00:45:01.160
We have cooked vegetarian food for three generations.

245
00:45:01.760 --> 00:45:07.400
Much of the processed food would be able to make healthy.

246
00:45:07.560 --> 00:45:13.800
That is definitely the answer when it comes to getting space food.

247
00:45:13.960 --> 00:45:20.320
Because you can't send up a whole chicken series with the craft.

248
00:45:21.680 --> 00:45:25.840
One must use new technology -

249
00:45:26.000 --> 00:45:30.600
- As for fermentation or for meat cultivation.

250
00:45:34.280 --> 00:45:41.800
The more challenges, questions and problems, the more meaningful my work.

251
00:45:41.960 --> 00:45:44.880
And therefore...

252
00:45:45.040 --> 00:45:51.000
... I founded Sophie's Bionutrients.
 That's why I have devoted my life to this.

253
00:46:18.000 --> 00:46:25.760
The city is located by the sea.
 The residential area was behind it.

254
00:46:25.920 --> 00:46:28.560
Everything was destroyed by the tsunami.

255
00:46:43.240 --> 00:46:50.560
Many in the locals were affected, and they were allowed to stay in shelters.

256
00:46:50.720 --> 00:46:54.360
No one had foreseen the disaster.

257
00:46:54.520 --> 00:46:59.680
In one hand people had a rice ball, in the other a piece of bread.

258
00:46:59.840 --> 00:47:03.680
Everything revolved around carbohydrates.

259
00:47:03.840 --> 00:47:09.240
In the shelters, everything was about calories, not about a balanced diet.

260
00:47:31.000 --> 00:47:35.800
Life Stock-GelÃ©n must undergo a pressure test.

261
00:47:35.960 --> 00:47:41.160
It is a requirement that is placed on all space food.

262
00:47:41.320 --> 00:47:46.000
It must withstand the pressure on the way out into space.

263
00:48:06.520 --> 00:48:13.760
One wonders if only the gel can give enough calories.

264
00:48:13.920 --> 00:48:20.480
In fact, a single package contains 200 kilocalories.

265
00:48:20.640 --> 00:48:25.280
It corresponds to the amount in a rice ball.

266
00:48:25.440 --> 00:48:29.560
You must also keep in mind what it is in space.

267
00:48:29.720 --> 00:48:36.520
The astronauts have a lot to stand in and they are in a hurry.

268
00:48:36.680 --> 00:48:44.840
This product lets them refill energy with just one hand.

269
00:49:02.080 --> 00:49:10.080
Space is an extreme environment that it is difficult for people to live in.

270
00:49:10.240 --> 00:49:18.240
It's like living in the shelters in disaster areas.

271
00:49:22.280 --> 00:49:28.760
We develop techniques for use in inhospitable space.

272
00:49:28.920 --> 00:49:33.720
With the technology and knowledge we retrieve from there -

273
00:49:33.880 --> 00:49:38.440
- We want to offer solutions to the problems the earth is facing.

274
00:49:49.640 --> 00:49:58.280
We get feedback from children now that the product tastes delicious.

275
00:49:58.440 --> 00:50:05.360
Emergency provider is often not associated with the word "delicious".

276
00:50:05.520 --> 00:50:13.120
But this is really delicious, and the kids want to eat it every day.

277
00:50:26.160 --> 00:50:33.360
- It's messy.
 - It tastes - orange and red.

278
00:50:33.520 --> 00:50:37.400
- Where do you want to eat it?
 -In heaven.

279
00:50:40.360 --> 00:50:45.280
The efforts in a disaster area are reminiscent of them in space.

280
00:50:45.440 --> 00:50:50.960
It is our job to produce food for both space and rescue efforts.

281
00:50:56.520 --> 00:51:05.080
Space technology is a forward -looking use of the technology to solve problems.

282
00:51:05.240 --> 00:51:09.480
If a disaster were to occur -

283
00:51:09.640 --> 00:51:15.520
- Calls the water and electricity supply.
 Then no infrastructure works.

284
00:51:15.680 --> 00:51:21.680
If we can solve these problems in space -

285
00:51:21.840 --> 00:51:25.720
- Then we can solve them in disaster areas.

286
00:52:11.440 --> 00:52:14.360
The space industry intervenes in everything.

287
00:52:14.520 --> 00:52:20.600
It is important for creating transformation in many sectors -

288
00:52:20.760 --> 00:52:26.240
- As the transport, energy and agricultural sector.

289
00:52:26.400 --> 00:52:29.120
It provides sustainable development.

290
00:52:29.280 --> 00:52:35.760
It also provides innovations and paves the way for the technology of the future.

291
00:52:38.440 --> 00:52:45.560
As I see it, Singapore can act as a hub.

292
00:52:45.720 --> 00:52:51.200
Geographically, it is located in a strategic location in Asia.

293
00:52:51.360 --> 00:52:54.640
Here we can exchange ideas -

294
00:52:54.800 --> 00:52:59.760
- Discover challenges and find new areas for collaboration.

295
00:52:59.920 --> 00:53:06.680
In the future, NASA will continue to develop its international contacts -

296
00:53:06.840 --> 00:53:11.720
- To make the flights successful.
 International cooperation is needed.

297
00:53:11.880 --> 00:53:15.840
Otherwise, the flights will not be successful.

298
00:53:37.120 --> 00:53:41.320
-Hello Alex!
 - HallÃ¥, Wieger.

299
00:53:53.400 --> 00:53:59.240
I am fascinated by space, but especially by the planets - and Mars.

300
00:53:59.400 --> 00:54:05.960
A great adventure this century becomes to bring people to Mars-

301
00:54:06.120 --> 00:54:11.200
- To explore how the planet is structured.

302
00:54:12.720 --> 00:54:15.720
I became interested in space as a kid.

303
00:54:15.880 --> 00:54:21.360
I looked up all the books about the planets and read about them.

304
00:54:21.520 --> 00:54:25.960
It made me interested in researching them.

305
00:54:26.120 --> 00:54:30.240
Now it has become a reality.

306
00:54:30.400 --> 00:54:36.720
If you want to stay on Mars or the moon, you have to eat.
 You can't do without food.

307
00:54:36.880 --> 00:54:44.240
Already the first March travelers will have to grow vegetables.

308
00:54:44.400 --> 00:54:47.800
Otherwise it is not possible, I think.

309
00:54:47.960 --> 00:54:53.280
And when we want to build a settlement such as international space station on the moon -

310
00:54:53.440 --> 00:54:58.560
- We will grow our vegetables there.
 It's the future:

311
00:54:58.720 --> 00:55:02.560
We create our own food where we live.

312
00:55:02.720 --> 00:55:09.760
The goal of our experiments is to achieve something for Mars and the moon.

313
00:55:09.920 --> 00:55:14.480
But we learn a lot that can be used on earth.

314
00:55:14.640 --> 00:55:20.400
We think new about agriculture.
 It must be circular.

315
00:55:48.800 --> 00:55:52.840
Translation: Roger Wiberg Swedish Media Text for SVT

316
00:56:33.720 --> 00:56:37.200
When Vaasa left the harbor, a salute was shot.

317
00:56:38.840 --> 00:56:42.480
When the boat got the impact side ordered the captain -

318
00:56:42.640 --> 00:56:46.840
- Closing the cannon gates so that the ship did not bring in water.

319
00:57:15.560 --> 00:57:23.720
In texts about the archaeological history of the 20th century, there are some things that are always addressed.

320
00:57:23.880 --> 00:57:29.200
Vaasa is one of them, because it is something quite outstanding.

321
00:57:29.360 --> 00:57:36.000
It is exceptionally well preserved and gives us lots of information about the story.
