00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:08.140
Welcome to Trosa and to history in SÃ¶rmland.

2
00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:14.220
I think many people think about this with summer and vacation when thinking about panties.

3
00:00:14.220 --> 00:00:22.300
Precisely the holiday and summer life has shaped this society in many ways and do so even today.

4
00:00:23.440 --> 00:00:30.640
It began in the 19th century, in the middle of the 19th century, Trosa was a fishing community with approximately 500 inhabitants

5
00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:37.100
The streaming fishing in particular was important at this time.
 Somewhere in the second half of the 1800s it began

6
00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:42.060
Going worse with the fishing industry, the flock fishing was not as reliable.

7
00:00:42.060 --> 00:00:49.760
At the same time, bathers, especially from Stockholm, began to discover Trosa as a seaside resort where one could live

8
00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:57.540
live a healthy bathing life.
 It became a more common and more common pleasure for the rich during the second half of

9
00:00:57.540 --> 00:01:04.360
19th century.
 Then people here in Trosa discovered that here there was a new income that could replace

10
00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:10.280
Streaming.
 They started renting out houses to the bathers for they had special performances

11
00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:17.520
About how to live in such an archipelago.
 They also began to build new to meet the wishes

12
00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:23.240
Painted with light linseed oil colors, it would be carpentry joy, that's what you wanted.

13
00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:30.140
So they began to reshape the river and the area around the river and created walking paths so they could

14
00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:32.140
Klan here and have a good time.

15
00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:38.320
You took tourism so seriously and invested so much on this so you even had some kind

16
00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:43.920
Tourist office, a bathing chambers here from the late 1800s and about 50 years ahead.

17
00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:52.560
This with summer, summer pleasure and holidays were something for the rich initially but

18
00:01:52.560 --> 00:02:00.020
From 1938 you can say that Sweden became a holidaying people if one is to express themselves.

19
00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:10.380
Then we got statutory with two weeks' vacation and still today we take this with holidays on big

20
00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:17.720
Serious, many of us anyway.
 Sweden is one of the countries in the world that has the most summer houses and

21
00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:23.860
Leisure boats if you look at the proportion of the population.
 Many who come here from other countries and settle

22
00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:30.520
themselves here say they feel first as the Swedes when they have acquired a summer house,

23
00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:32.820
Then you have something to talk about on the coffee break.

24
00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:39.500
Do you want to experience a real summer bead but also take part in an interesting and exciting

25
00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:45.780
History about this with holiday life and bathing so come here to Trosa.
