1
00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:55.000
Tjena, it's Tord.
 I'm getting a little late.

2
00:00:55.160 --> 00:01:00.720
I email the report this afternoon.
 Hello.

3
00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:07.880
That's me.
 I'm getting a little late today.

4
00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:14.280
I email the report this afternoon.
 It is good.
 Hello!

5
00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:01.680
Yes!

6
00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:05.720
Yes Yes!
 I'm coming!

7
00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:17.880
- Is that this?
 -I do not think so.
 I have an avi.

8
00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:24.520
- It has not come.
 - It would have come a long time ago.

9
00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:31.560
- Then is this this?!
 - I should have a shirt, not a book.

10
00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:37.680
- It's not even my name.
 - Wait a little, then.

11
00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:42.160
Be so good, here you have your shirt.

12
00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:48.640
- It's not my name ... - fuck!
 It is from Ellos!

13
00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:53.080
Now we do this ... it will be good.

14
00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:59.880
-Nice weekend!
 - You can't close now.

15
00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:04.240
You just stand there.

16
00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:10.400
If you wonder where Berit is, she has gone home.

17
00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:23.720
- Has the fourth gone?
 -No.

18
00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:30.400
- So it hasn't gone?
 -No.

19
00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:37.280
Has the four really not gone?

20
00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:39.240
No!

21
00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:44.960
- It's on Furusundsgatan.
 - Aha, on the walkway.

22
00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:51.240
- You have to try it.
 What a lunch!
 - Have you tried the pocket at the corner?

23
00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:54.960
Is he tired?

24
00:03:55.120 --> 00:04:01.360
It's a tape recorder.
 He is with his dad today.

25
00:04:06.960 --> 00:04:14.720
You have exactly the qualities and the know-how we are looking for.

26
00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:21.840
I want to end by asking some more personal questions.

27
00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:27.800
We say you got the job.

28
00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:35.040
It's the first day.
 You will arrive well in advance and are assigned a study room.

29
00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:38.560
Then comes Andersson, the red cry.

30
00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:46.160
It is his room and the light in his new room impairs his psoriasis.

31
00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:53.120
-What are you doing?
 - Return the room.

32
00:04:53.280 --> 00:05:00.120
Well, I understand ... then I say ...

33
00:05:00.280 --> 00:05:03.720
Nothing.

34
00:05:05.200 --> 00:05:07.720
Good!

35
00:05:09.840 --> 00:05:17.120
It's twelve o'clock.
 Andersson proposes a lunch as a reconciliation gesture.

36
00:05:18.200 --> 00:05:21.600
-What are you doing?
 -Declines.

37
00:05:21.760 --> 00:05:26.840
No, I do not.
 I say he has to wait.

38
00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:32.920
- He has to wait?
 - He has to wait half an hour.

39
00:05:33.080 --> 00:05:36.080
Good!
 Very good.

40
00:05:36.240 --> 00:05:43.760
A delegation from our New York Office asks for me.
 What are you doing?

41
00:05:43.920 --> 00:05:46.960
I say you are back soon.

42
00:05:47.120 --> 00:05:50.680
No, I say you work ...

43
00:05:50.840 --> 00:05:57.160
I say you ... I say nothing ...

44
00:05:57.320 --> 00:06:04.880
It's totally shiny now ... I say you have lunch with the king!

45
00:06:05.040 --> 00:06:07.680
The king?

46
00:06:07.840 --> 00:06:11.760
Yes, you have lunch with the king.

47
00:06:11.920 --> 00:06:17.720
It is good.
 It's very good!

48
00:06:18.760 --> 00:06:23.400
The job is yours.
 What are you saying?

49
00:06:38.600 --> 00:06:45.160
People are happy to get around, that's not it.
 But the gays take our jobs!

50
00:06:46.400 --> 00:06:53.440
Had it not been for all the gays I would have been a hairdresser tomorrow day!

51
00:06:58.880 --> 00:07:03.320
Paul, do not throw the tea leaves.

52
00:07:03.480 --> 00:07:09.840
I have taken a course so I can predict your future in tea blades.

53
00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:13.000
It's about your career.

54
00:07:13.160 --> 00:07:18.200
I see a park bench and a bottle of T-red.

55
00:07:18.360 --> 00:07:22.240
Lodis.
 It is a free profession.

56
00:07:22.400 --> 00:07:27.120
Wait, I can predict my hands.

57
00:07:27.280 --> 00:07:33.920
Oh!
 It will go well for you.
 I see your home, a big villa.

58
00:07:34.080 --> 00:07:39.720
Here is your garage with your nice cars.
 Do you see what it is?

59
00:07:39.880 --> 00:07:42.800
A swimming pool.

60
00:07:45.400 --> 00:07:48.000
Congratulations!

61
00:07:56.360 --> 00:08:01.840
Do you know what Magnus's parents gave me?
 A turned bowl!

62
00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:09.120
The ugliest man ever seen!
 I have been with ceramics for a long time!

63
00:08:09.280 --> 00:08:15.840
Has anyone painted it on the dump?!
 "I'll paint my little mushroom ...!"

64
00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:22.600
It's an old Inka pattern.
 I have made it!

65
00:08:23.600 --> 00:08:31.440
I meant that you just appreciate the bowl if you are sober ...

66
00:08:31.600 --> 00:08:38.720
I have been drinking ... and it will be wrong.
 Don't drink and turn!

67
00:08:38.880 --> 00:08:42.800
Magnus, is there more of something?

68
00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:50.600
She is right in that. You probably can't turn if you have been drinking.

69
00:08:53.720 --> 00:08:55.720
Frida ...?

70
00:09:09.600 --> 00:09:14.040
-Just!
 - You may have judgment.

71
00:09:14.200 --> 00:09:20.440
How many demand police permits to slap New Year's rockets?

72
00:09:20.600 --> 00:09:27.080
If I take home some college blocks from work, isn't that criminal?

73
00:09:27.240 --> 00:09:35.480
- All takes home pens from work.
 - We have probably all done something illegal.

74
00:09:35.640 --> 00:09:41.840
Sure it is.
 I killed a guy once.

75
00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:46.520
It is well prescribed now.

76
00:09:46.680 --> 00:09:53.800
You know ... A bunch of guys go to Copenhagen and drink too much.

77
00:09:53.960 --> 00:09:59.600
- How did you do, then?
 - There will be noise in the sausage queue ...

78
00:09:59.760 --> 00:10:04.680
You push each other ... and so it goes as it goes.

79
00:10:04.840 --> 00:10:11.880
–And it ends with ... dead?
 - Knuckled, huh?

80
00:10:15.600 --> 00:10:23.080
- All has done something illegal.
 - But this is serious, Ulf.

81
00:10:23.240 --> 00:10:29.520
Yes, but it was a Danish.
 It may be a bit mitigating.

82
00:10:32.520 --> 00:10:35.720
- More coffee?
 -Gladly.

83
00:10:40.880 --> 00:10:46.720
- It will be good with a little more coffee.
 –And cake.

84
00:11:17.200 --> 00:11:19.400
Delicious!

85
00:11:20.880 --> 00:11:24.560
Magnus, can you take a little more cake?

86
00:11:24.720 --> 00:11:29.040
- Magnus?
 -Sorry?

87
00:11:29.200 --> 00:11:35.240
May I take a bit more?
 Otherwise, I'll kill you.

88
00:11:35.400 --> 00:11:42.320
I was just joking!
 It was an accident ... it's been many years ago.

89
00:11:43.320 --> 00:11:48.400
I was packed too when it happened.

90
00:11:54.040 --> 00:11:58.040
GROAN

91
00:12:04.680 --> 00:12:12.560
Everyone found back?
 It is important when surviving in the forest.

92
00:12:12.720 --> 00:12:18.040
Now you have been looking for something edible for half an hour.

93
00:12:18.200 --> 00:12:23.440
Should we see what you have found?
 A little leaf ...

94
00:12:23.600 --> 00:12:28.160
A stick.
 Maybe you can suck on it ...

95
00:12:28.320 --> 00:12:33.320
You should not eat this one.
 It is directly fatal.

96
00:12:33.480 --> 00:12:37.480
- Jasmine?
 - It's a fly fungus.

97
00:12:37.640 --> 00:12:43.880
You can also be careful with the glass bit.
 Otherwise it was good.

98
00:12:44.040 --> 00:12:46.040
Jim?

99
00:12:46.200 --> 00:12:50.640
I have found a pizza.

100
00:12:50.800 --> 00:12:55.360
You cannot always count on that.
 - Jasmine?

101
00:12:55.520 --> 00:13:02.920
- It's a capricciosa.
 - It can probably be true.

102
00:13:03.080 --> 00:13:07.280
It's a capricciosa.

103
00:13:12.440 --> 00:13:18.000
- Do you know what I'm thinking about?
 - No, Carita.

104
00:13:18.160 --> 00:13:24.720
- Don't we go away on vacation?
 - Her god, Carita, where are we going?

105
00:13:24.880 --> 00:13:29.400
We could go to Varberg.

106
00:13:29.560 --> 00:13:35.400
Should we go all the way to Varberg?!
 What will we do there?

107
00:13:35.560 --> 00:13:42.160
We can visit Varberg's fortress and look at Bockstensmannen.

108
00:13:42.320 --> 00:13:47.840
-Who is it?
 - It's a man from the Middle Ages.

109
00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:54.040
He was found in a marsh.
 Now he is in a booth in Varberg's fortress.

110
00:13:54.200 --> 00:13:59.760
The hair is left.
 The lips and brain are in a glass jar ...

111
00:13:59.920 --> 00:14:04.520
No, Carita!
 I don't want to look at that.

112
00:14:04.680 --> 00:14:11.600
- No, maybe we should stay home.
 -Yes we're allowed to do that.

113
00:14:11.760 --> 00:14:16.800
- bowl on you, Carita.
 -bowl on you, Per-Arne.

114
00:14:19.360 --> 00:14:22.840
The lips in a glass jar ...

115
00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:29.040
We cannot manage long without water.
 Here is the creek.

116
00:14:29.200 --> 00:14:32.200
It is a pulse vein in the ecosystem.

117
00:14:32.360 --> 00:14:39.160
The water is filtered through stone and sand and becomes really clear and nice.

118
00:14:39.320 --> 00:14:43.520
We should be happy about our fine water.

119
00:14:43.680 --> 00:14:48.880
The Swedish rivers have always provided our countryside.

120
00:14:49.040 --> 00:14:55.320
I can't imagine a more beautiful sound than rippling water.

121
00:14:58.360 --> 00:15:05.960
You will not find a better thirst quencher at the finest restaurant.

122
00:15:07.960 --> 00:15:12.680
I think it was Stagnelius who scalded:

123
00:15:12.840 --> 00:15:19.800
"Lord, you let us taste your sweet water. It is caressing my throat."

124
00:15:28.400 --> 00:15:31.640
A little salty ...

125
00:15:35.560 --> 00:15:38.200
We quit for today.

126
00:15:59.960 --> 00:16:03.520
It tastes good I can think.

127
00:16:05.200 --> 00:16:08.880
- What is it for taste?
 - Pistage.

128
00:16:09.040 --> 00:16:12.360
Nice it should be!

129
00:16:13.480 --> 00:16:19.560
When it is hot and summer you want an ice cream.

130
00:16:19.720 --> 00:16:23.320
And so many varieties there are ...

131
00:16:23.480 --> 00:16:27.120
Many varieties to lick on ...

132
00:16:28.640 --> 00:16:34.200
- Can I offer a cigarette?
 -No thanks.
 I do not smoke.

133
00:16:34.360 --> 00:16:39.920
But you are licking ... you have nothing against it?

134
00:16:40.080 --> 00:16:44.720
–Wa?
 - Should you come home with me?

135
00:16:44.880 --> 00:16:52.080
- I have a big pack chocolate.
 - No, I'm not going to come home with you.

136
00:16:52.240 --> 00:17:00.040
There are many nice things at my house.
 Many things to lick on ...

137
00:17:00.200 --> 00:17:07.400
- I don't want to come home with you!
 - There are grogg and wood too!

138
00:17:07.560 --> 00:17:11.640
Have you never seen a Puma before?!

139
00:17:41.280 --> 00:17:47.680
You have a lot of customer contact and we must appear serious.

140
00:17:47.840 --> 00:17:53.920
In this context, your new style can be a load.

141
00:17:54.920 --> 00:17:58.880
Do you think so?

142
00:18:24.160 --> 00:18:28.160
Child cry

143
00:18:31.720 --> 00:18:36.600
Are you a good, silent little girl?

144
00:18:39.680 --> 00:18:46.080
Do you smile at mom?
 Do you like Mom so much?

145
00:18:48.400 --> 00:18:51.400
Gulli, Gulli, Gulli ...

146
00:18:51.920 --> 00:18:55.920
Child cry

147
00:19:02.720 --> 00:19:07.560
First, it is as if he suffers a great sadness ...

148
00:19:07.720 --> 00:19:12.880
Then it is just pure unadulterated desire and joy!

149
00:19:14.640 --> 00:19:18.360
Magnus first turns red ...

150
00:19:18.520 --> 00:19:26.080
He smiles and begins to gasp.
 Then it is as if he sees God and all angels!

151
00:19:27.080 --> 00:19:33.200
My Ulf has never been to any Ulf Lundell concert.

152
00:19:52.680 --> 00:19:59.240
- Now only Ulf guesses.
 - Now we take them!

153
00:19:59.400 --> 00:20:04.800
-A stick?
 A flag?
 A flower?
 -Yes!

154
00:20:04.960 --> 00:20:09.400
-That went quick.
 - We know each other so well.

155
00:20:09.560 --> 00:20:13.720
Sometimes I can almost read her thoughts.

156
00:20:13.880 --> 00:20:19.240
Now we are, honey.
 Now we take them!

157
00:20:22.600 --> 00:20:25.400
Drive!

158
00:20:25.560 --> 00:20:29.520
Old man?
 Woman?

159
00:20:29.680 --> 00:20:33.360
Married?
 Marriage?
 A couple?

160
00:20:33.520 --> 00:20:38.000
Polygamy?
 Study circle?

161
00:20:38.160 --> 00:20:41.920
Square?
 Prison?

162
00:20:42.080 --> 00:20:46.040
Magnifying glass?

163
00:20:46.200 --> 00:20:51.200
-Dog?
 Wolf?
 Matte?
 Husse?!
 -Stop!

164
00:20:51.360 --> 00:20:55.360
-Damn!
 What was that?
 -Loyalty.

165
00:20:55.520 --> 00:21:01.960
- It was not possible to see.
 - How would you draw it?

166
00:21:02.120 --> 00:21:06.160
Now it's Andreas.

167
00:21:11.400 --> 00:21:14.440
Now I start.

168
00:21:16.800 --> 00:21:20.440
-A fish!
 -Yes!

169
00:21:21.600 --> 00:21:25.920
It was much easier.
 Fish...

170
00:21:33.400 --> 00:21:39.200
What would you do if you won a million?

171
00:21:39.360 --> 00:21:42.720
Then I would...

172
00:21:45.320 --> 00:21:51.000
God, what a hard time.
 I would...

173
00:21:51.160 --> 00:21:54.160
I would travel around the world.

174
00:21:54.320 --> 00:22:00.440
And then I would donate some to Doctors Without Borders.

175
00:22:01.440 --> 00:22:07.080
-And you?
 - I would buy a lot of bikes.

176
00:22:07.240 --> 00:22:12.960
Then I would start a bicycle rental company.

177
00:22:13.120 --> 00:22:18.440
But the tramps would go backwards instead of forward.

178
00:22:18.600 --> 00:22:24.200
Everyone who rents bikes would roll at once.

179
00:22:26.560 --> 00:22:32.040
It will look very fun.

180
00:22:32.200 --> 00:22:39.200
But what is the point of changing the tramps so that people roll?

181
00:22:40.160 --> 00:22:45.080
- That it looks fun.
 -Yes...

182
00:22:46.600 --> 00:22:52.400
But maybe it is unnecessary to spend a million on it?

183
00:22:52.560 --> 00:22:57.600
Yes, maybe for you, but not for me.

184
00:23:03.400 --> 00:23:06.080
-House?
 -Yes!

185
00:23:06.240 --> 00:23:09.680
Then it's me.

186
00:23:14.080 --> 00:23:18.760
-Drive!
 -An old man?
 A girl?

187
00:23:18.920 --> 00:23:25.200
Girl?
 Cry?
 Burning?
 Explosion?
 One can fly?
 The Superman?

188
00:23:25.360 --> 00:23:30.000
-No!
 Do not you see...?!
 -Stop!

189
00:23:30.160 --> 00:23:34.920
- What should it represent?
 -Enthusiasm.

190
00:23:35.080 --> 00:23:39.240
-Enthusiasm!
 - Yeah ...

191
00:23:39.400 --> 00:23:43.440
–Okay, Andreas!
 -Come on!

192
00:23:47.600 --> 00:23:51.040
I'm starting ... now!

193
00:23:53.040 --> 00:23:56.960
- Sun?
 -Yes!

194
00:23:57.880 --> 00:24:01.040
The sun?
 "God, what a hard!"

195
00:24:01.200 --> 00:24:04.320
-Perfect!
 - We lead, huh?

196
00:24:24.440 --> 00:24:29.920
- What a lot of good guys there are!
 -I know!

197
00:24:32.120 --> 00:24:38.840
- Check him!
 One would have one!
 -Really!

198
00:24:39.640 --> 00:24:46.920
Should you go ahead and talk or hope he comes here?

199
00:24:47.080 --> 00:24:50.840
Things like that is difficult.

200
00:24:51.000 --> 00:24:57.720
I think you should go forward ... and be a little Palestinian.

201
00:24:59.120 --> 00:25:05.640
–Wa?
 - I think that guys like.

202
00:25:05.800 --> 00:25:11.240
- How then Palestinian?
 - A little mysterious.

203
00:25:12.080 --> 00:25:19.040
-How?
 - Storm, female and a little dangerous.

204
00:25:20.800 --> 00:25:27.160
Do you think?
 It sounds really strange, I think.

205
00:25:27.320 --> 00:25:32.720
- Well I just said what I thought.
 -Yes...

206
00:25:33.720 --> 00:25:39.920
You don't have to be Palestinian if you don't want to.
 I'm not an expert.

207
00:25:44.600 --> 00:25:50.360
Vegetarians like animals but do not eat meat.

208
00:25:50.520 --> 00:25:55.760
What a bad luck that almost all animals are made of meat.

209
00:25:55.920 --> 00:26:00.800
The sea?
 Storm?
 Cinderella?

210
00:26:00.960 --> 00:26:04.000
South America?
 Dance band?

211
00:26:04.160 --> 00:26:07.480
What the hell ... Light milk?!

212
00:26:07.640 --> 00:26:11.520
- Merchant milk, then?
 -Stop!

213
00:26:12.400 --> 00:26:16.160
Nostalgia, Frida.

214
00:26:23.680 --> 00:26:26.200
Drive!

215
00:26:26.360 --> 00:26:29.840
-Square?
 -Yes!

216
00:26:34.560 --> 00:26:37.040
We won, huh?

217
00:27:14.280 --> 00:27:18.280
