1
00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:55.480
Move!

2
00:00:55.640 --> 00:01:01.440
- Mom, can you lift me?
 - Celere yourself when you're so short!

3
00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:05.720
- Where did they live before?
 - In Uddevalla.

4
00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:13.520
Hell is solved!
 The historyless bureaucrats destroy a cultural heritage.

5
00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:21.440
- The area of the park is known ... - Park?
 They will demolish Posten's café!

6
00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:28.000
The postal management intends to demolish the cafeteria!
 Do you understand!

7
00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:32.120
We do not have coffee stains on the postcards.

8
00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:39.720
- Dad, our new neighbors move in!
 - Then we have to start locking at night.

9
00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:49.160
Well ... Chevrolet.
 It is not enough with Swedish!

10
00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:54.600
- It does not matter.
 - Related they look!

11
00:01:54.760 --> 00:02:02.120
- Place as if they owned the place!
 - They bought it from Sara!

12
00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:07.080
Our little Sara.
 Such a neighborhood ...

13
00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:14.520
- We would become friends, I knew.
 - You said "APA" in the first few years!

14
00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:21.120
- Why are you always so suspicious?
 - I'm just cautious.

15
00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:26.920
- You are paranoid.
 - Paranoid means ...

16
00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:34.200
- You were the same with Berntson.
 - He painted the garage door black!

17
00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:40.280
It doesn't have to mean that he is a devil worshiper!

18
00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:44.920
-Just.
 - Oh, I was wrong.
 I admit!

19
00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:50.000
I had read a nasty book and was worried.

20
00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:55.040
Now I go and greet.
 Follow!
 Gustav?

21
00:02:55.200 --> 00:03:02.160
- No, I have something else to do.
 - Why don't you want to meet them?

22
00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:08.840
Anyone who has a bigger car, their own solarium and earns more does not want to meet Dad.

23
00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:16.600
- How do you know he earns more?
 - All earn more than you.
 Come now!

24
00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:23.640
No!
 We lived here first.
 They will come to us.

25
00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:30.320
- God, what you are childish!
 - proud, it's called!
 And hungry ...

26
00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:44.720
Missing historical value?
 The coffee machine is from 1972!

27
00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:48.720
It is not enough for K -marking?

28
00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:53.800
National interest?
 But then we agree!

29
00:03:53.960 --> 00:03:58.800
Then I'll call next week.
 Yes I do!

30
00:03:58.960 --> 00:04:02.720
-How is it going?
 -Slow.

31
00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:09.600
Why are you so woe?
 You get a new nice coffee room instead.

32
00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:18.120
It's about democracy!
 Major changes should be made with consent!

33
00:04:18.280 --> 00:04:23.720
138 voted for and you and Pettersson voted against.

34
00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:29.040
There are people who dare to take cultural responsibility!

35
00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:35.320
Then you and Pettersson get to go to the municipal office on Saturday.

36
00:04:35.480 --> 00:04:39.920
Not Pettersson, he has a match.

37
00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:47.240
- Dad, why don't we have a computer?
 - So we can think for ourselves.

38
00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:52.400
The neighbors, Göran and Annika, have each through Göran's company.

39
00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:56.720
Stolen, it is called.
 What do you have there?

40
00:04:56.880 --> 00:05:02.440
Phantom magazines.
 I got them from Göran.
 He is Reko.

41
00:05:02.600 --> 00:05:07.600
Yes, Göran says so.
 He thinks the whole area seems to be reco.

42
00:05:07.760 --> 00:05:14.880
Reko?
 They have lived here one day and Max comes home and is ugly in their mouths!

43
00:05:15.040 --> 00:05:20.240
- What is it for people?
 - I can tell you.

44
00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:24.240
They were born in 1960, married for a year.

45
00:05:24.400 --> 00:05:30.720
Göran is a construction engineer and earns SEK 350,000 a year!

46
00:05:30.880 --> 00:05:35.920
- How to know everything?
 - Göran will open an account in the bank.

47
00:05:36.080 --> 00:05:40.320
–350,000!
 - So it goes if you are driven!

48
00:05:40.480 --> 00:05:44.320
He became "Entrepreneur of the Year" in Uddevalla.

49
00:05:44.480 --> 00:05:52.840
-What company?
 The masquerade league!
 - Ask instead of glory in the window.

50
00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:56.560
I have binoculars!

51
00:05:56.720 --> 00:06:01.040
Check out what I got from Annika!

52
00:06:01.200 --> 00:06:04.040
I got them for free!

53
00:06:04.200 --> 00:06:09.080
Nothing is free.
 They are certainly looking for something!

54
00:06:09.240 --> 00:06:12.480
Annika is very nice.

55
00:06:12.640 --> 00:06:19.120
It takes more than a pair of skates to win my friendship!

56
00:06:19.280 --> 00:06:25.160
-Hello!
 Is there anyone home?
 - Hi neighbors, so nice!

57
00:06:25.320 --> 00:06:29.200
I would thank you for the skates.

58
00:06:29.360 --> 00:06:33.520
- Are you Gösta?
 - Gustav ... Svensson.

59
00:06:33.680 --> 00:06:37.640
Göran Forslund is my name.

60
00:06:37.800 --> 00:06:44.640
- We have met everyone except you ... –Ni save the best until last.

61
00:06:48.800 --> 00:06:55.320
Do you want something?
 Coffee, espresso, cappuccino, deer saddle?

62
00:06:55.480 --> 00:07:00.520
No, we have eaten the minced meat pie we got from Lena.

63
00:07:00.680 --> 00:07:04.720
Well, it was you who ate it up.

64
00:07:04.880 --> 00:07:10.280
Neighborhood is like a flower.
 The more it is cared for, the more beautiful it becomes.

65
00:07:10.440 --> 00:07:15.400
-Fine!
 Are you writing too?
 - Writing?

66
00:07:15.560 --> 00:07:20.240
I'm in a poetry association ...

67
00:07:20.400 --> 00:07:24.280
We can save that for another time.

68
00:07:24.440 --> 00:07:27.920
You have to be proud of Lena.

69
00:07:28.080 --> 00:07:32.520
She does not need to be ashamed of the meat pie.

70
00:07:32.680 --> 00:07:38.320
No, her career!
 Being able to combine work and family life.

71
00:07:38.480 --> 00:07:43.240
But behind every successful woman ...

72
00:07:43.400 --> 00:07:47.240
... stands an envious postman!

73
00:07:51.480 --> 00:07:58.200
There are pros and cons of my job.
 Without Gustav it would not have been possible.

74
00:07:58.360 --> 00:08:04.800
It is a full -time job to keep track of changes and pots.

75
00:08:06.880 --> 00:08:09.320
Did you want something?

76
00:08:09.480 --> 00:08:15.280
- I would have to ask for a service.
 - I almost thought out.

77
00:08:15.440 --> 00:08:19.320
My toolbox remained in Uddevalla.

78
00:08:19.480 --> 00:08:24.840
Now you want me to go and pick it up?

79
00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:28.720
Can I borrow your?

80
00:08:28.880 --> 00:08:35.240
That plate bag with wrench and screwdriver ...

81
00:08:35.400 --> 00:08:42.560
I had intended to start some stuff, but of course you have to borrow it.

82
00:08:42.720 --> 00:08:48.040
We will build a sauna and want to get started.

83
00:08:48.200 --> 00:08:53.240
Building a sauna, which we have been thinking about for so long!

84
00:08:53.400 --> 00:08:59.720
- Why are you going to build a sauna?
 - We miss the one we had in Uddevalla.

85
00:08:59.880 --> 00:09:05.720
Of course, you are not going to move back there?

86
00:09:07.560 --> 00:09:14.440
- Should you go and get the toolbox?
 - Göran, do you know what is getting into?

87
00:09:14.600 --> 00:09:19.920
Building a sauna is more than just throwing out boards and nails.

88
00:09:20.080 --> 00:09:25.240
- I've been able to build a couple.
 -Nice.
 Go the same way you came!

89
00:09:25.400 --> 00:09:32.920
Gustav believes that the toolbox is in Boden.
 It is wrapped in Christmas paper.

90
00:09:34.200 --> 00:09:38.520
- Christmas paper?
 - I haven't had time to open.

91
00:09:38.680 --> 00:09:44.720
- I come back when I'm done.
 - You can give it to Gustav next Christmas!

92
00:09:54.200 --> 00:09:57.080
He took my Christmas present.

93
00:09:57.240 --> 00:10:04.680
You got the toolbox in 1987 and have not opened it.
 Blame yourself!

94
00:10:04.840 --> 00:10:12.080
- I've been waiting for the right time.
 - It came now!
 Fun to be used.

95
00:10:12.240 --> 00:10:17.920
I recognize the type.
 Already after a day he builds a sauna ...

96
00:10:18.080 --> 00:10:22.880
It doesn't have to take 15 years between thought and action!

97
00:10:23.040 --> 00:10:30.000
I have talked about a sauna because we would have something to look forward to.

98
00:10:30.160 --> 00:10:37.040
- I don't want to throw anything together.
 -You're just jealous.

99
00:10:37.200 --> 00:10:43.600
We have been longing for a sauna since we moved in!

100
00:10:43.760 --> 00:10:50.320
It is possible.
 But at least we have the dream left.

101
00:10:50.480 --> 00:10:57.560
That's more than the one where the tool stays can say.
 Did you see the moving guys?

102
00:10:57.720 --> 00:11:02.560
Not a estimated crown there, not.

103
00:11:02.720 --> 00:11:08.120
- It was his brothers.
 - Yes, it's called so.

104
00:11:08.280 --> 00:11:12.120
What does the building committee say?

105
00:11:12.280 --> 00:11:18.720
Göran has its own construction company and all the conditions you should have.

106
00:11:18.880 --> 00:11:23.440
-Mother?
 Dad?
 Are you sleeping?
 - Come on you, honey.

107
00:11:23.600 --> 00:11:30.920
- Is there a monster under the bed?
 - No, I knew you were here.

108
00:11:31.080 --> 00:11:35.840
-What is it?
 - Have you seen my Phantom?

109
00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:40.040
Last time I saw them was on the coffee table.

110
00:11:40.200 --> 00:11:46.920
- I thought I saw Lina with them.
 - She's always on my stuff!

111
00:11:49.200 --> 00:11:56.480
Lena, isn't it nasty that the children run in foreign people?

112
00:11:56.640 --> 00:12:00.720
Children take an easy impression!

113
00:12:00.880 --> 00:12:07.560
With Göran there are fast cars, black builds, video violence, data violence ...

114
00:12:07.720 --> 00:12:13.080
- Set now, Gustav.
 - You think I'm jealous.

115
00:12:13.240 --> 00:12:20.920
Because Göran makes a lot of money, is handy and has a very nice car.

116
00:12:21.080 --> 00:12:28.320
What I care about is our family.
 That my values are passed on.

117
00:12:32.360 --> 00:12:36.800
I'm trying to talk seriously!

118
00:12:36.960 --> 00:12:44.680
Soon you are sitting out in the garden with Göran and having a great time!

119
00:12:44.840 --> 00:12:51.520
- Göran just thinks of himself!
 - Fun for you - a soul mate!

120
00:12:58.800 --> 00:13:04.480
If they want to become friends with us, the ball is with them!

121
00:13:04.640 --> 00:13:10.720
Gustav Svensson's friendship, should you deserve it?

122
00:13:10.880 --> 00:13:17.320
I have lent a tool box, stretched out my hand ...

123
00:13:17.480 --> 00:13:24.440
- I want to see what I get back.
 - Probably a toolbox.

124
00:13:41.800 --> 00:13:46.720
Hello!
 Well ... how was it in school?

125
00:13:46.880 --> 00:13:51.120
Absolutely uninteresting as usual.

126
00:13:51.280 --> 00:13:58.600
Dad has not come home.
 He is well saving that coffee room.

127
00:13:58.760 --> 00:14:04.920
- Max, can you go to the business?
 - You have said that I am too small.

128
00:14:05.080 --> 00:14:10.400
- It was eight years ago.
 - But that was good!

129
00:14:10.560 --> 00:14:16.880
Ok, everyone!
 Tonight, you understand, is no ordinary evening.

130
00:14:17.040 --> 00:14:23.720
- We will do something together.
 -Wait!
 It's not so dangerous.

131
00:14:25.080 --> 00:14:33.120
The world around us is turbulent.
 New values are thrown against us ...

132
00:14:33.280 --> 00:14:37.720
I was wrong - stick, you.

133
00:14:37.880 --> 00:14:45.920
It is important not to be deceived by the beautiful words of the lism.

134
00:14:46.080 --> 00:14:51.480
- Göran and Annika ... - funny that you thought about them.

135
00:14:51.640 --> 00:14:58.480
What is important in life?
 Yes, the family - La Famiglia.

136
00:14:58.640 --> 00:15:04.520
Therefore, I will set up a day in the family sign to be called:

137
00:15:04.680 --> 00:15:07.560
Family Day.

138
00:15:07.720 --> 00:15:15.720
Kids, can't we help and have a really nice party tonight?

139
00:15:19.080 --> 00:15:26.720
Hello!
 Do you hear, Göran and I will have a move -in party tonight.
 Do you want to...?

140
00:15:26.880 --> 00:15:32.120
No rush - it starts at seven!

141
00:15:32.280 --> 00:15:38.720
- Line, go out and pick up the trunk bowl.
 -Stop!
 Stop, stop.

142
00:15:38.880 --> 00:15:46.040
- Wasn't something that we forgot?
 -Good!
 The cardboard mugs and plates.

143
00:15:47.200 --> 00:15:53.280
- Oh, then Max and I run over.
 - How can you do this?

144
00:15:53.440 --> 00:16:01.520
This is Görans and Annika's first party!
 Come now, it will be fun!

145
00:16:01.680 --> 00:16:08.920
Never!
 If it is the family's day, it is, if I should celebrate it myself!

146
00:16:09.080 --> 00:16:15.600
Ok.
 Serpentines and balloons are in the bottom kitchen box!

147
00:16:20.280 --> 00:16:28.120
I never thought my family would fall for such simple tricks.

148
00:16:28.280 --> 00:16:34.640
Cheap food, some windy drink, music, nice socializing ...

149
00:16:34.800 --> 00:16:40.080
... maybe a good cigar, brandy ... Satan!

150
00:16:43.680 --> 00:16:50.040
Hello then, Annika!
 I will come in to you tomorrow.
 Greeting Göran!

151
00:16:57.400 --> 00:17:00.800
Come now, kids.

152
00:17:00.960 --> 00:17:06.440
-Hey what are you doing?
 - I actually lie and think.

153
00:17:06.600 --> 00:17:10.480
On how the Phantom is comfortable in the skull cave?

154
00:17:10.640 --> 00:17:17.880
- No, but on how it should go for us.
 -Don't play martyr now, Gustav!

155
00:17:18.040 --> 00:17:23.280
Has it been hard?
 Do you want to go to bed?

156
00:17:23.440 --> 00:17:29.280
- The clock is a quarter to nine.
 - Our family day is soon over.

157
00:17:29.440 --> 00:17:33.920
It was no successful premiere.

158
00:17:34.080 --> 00:17:40.640
You and I have talked about having a neighborhood party.
 Fun that it got rid of!

159
00:17:40.800 --> 00:17:48.400
When we invite everyone will come: Pettersson, postmaster Melander ...

160
00:17:48.560 --> 00:17:52.520
- Everyone was there.
 - Melander?

161
00:17:52.680 --> 00:18:00.200
He and Pettersson talked for a long time.
 Pettersson will become a district manager.

162
00:18:00.360 --> 00:18:05.720
- I have applied for the place!
 - You have been looking for all places for ten years.

163
00:18:05.880 --> 00:18:12.640
You can apply for the job as a waitress in the new cafeteria!

164
00:18:23.200 --> 00:18:27.080
The doorbell calls who is it?

165
00:18:27.240 --> 00:18:32.880
- Forslund, may I come in?
 - Conduct, I'm just a little busy.

166
00:18:33.040 --> 00:18:35.920
Ok, come in.

167
00:18:36.080 --> 00:18:42.640
Hey ... how are things going for you?

168
00:18:42.800 --> 00:18:50.080
Lena told me you had to work.
 Do you want some food and beer?

169
00:18:50.240 --> 00:18:54.720
I do not have time.
 Must be ready for tomorrow morning.

170
00:18:54.880 --> 00:18:59.920
Well, Bamse's Christmas toys ...

171
00:19:00.080 --> 00:19:04.600
I'm basically done with it.

172
00:19:04.760 --> 00:19:10.560
- How was it at the party?
 Boring?
 - It was really successful.

173
00:19:10.720 --> 00:19:16.320
I probably did away with the end.

174
00:19:16.480 --> 00:19:21.920
The post is forwarded, but we have not received any letters.

175
00:19:22.080 --> 00:19:26.400
It turned out to be Pettersson's fault.

176
00:19:26.560 --> 00:19:33.720
- He got rid of his promotion ... - Göran!
 Can I invite you to something?

177
00:19:33.880 --> 00:19:40.120
I am so happy that we have got such nice neighbors.

178
00:19:40.280 --> 00:19:43.720
I have a question.

179
00:19:43.880 --> 00:19:51.120
This morning came the building committee.
 Some neighbor has reported me for black construction.

180
00:19:51.280 --> 00:19:56.400
Do you know who it might be?

181
00:19:56.560 --> 00:20:02.120
Göran ... I have to tell you one thing.

182
00:20:02.280 --> 00:20:08.200
Berntson down on the corner ... He seems pretty ok.

183
00:20:08.360 --> 00:20:16.160
Many of us suspect he is a devil worshiper.
 There you have your husband!

184
00:20:16.320 --> 00:20:22.160
I heard that you had been named Entrepreneur of the Year in Uddevalla.

185
00:20:22.320 --> 00:20:27.720
I myself am named this year's postman.

186
00:20:27.880 --> 00:20:37.080
Melander offered pear cider and the table was full of almond cubes.

187
00:20:37.240 --> 00:20:40.400
Like we ate almond cubes!

188
00:20:43.560 --> 00:20:49.920
What fun it was with Göran and Annika!
 They have such a nice wall in the living room.

189
00:20:50.080 --> 00:20:55.080
With a handy man it can get really cozy.

190
00:20:55.240 --> 00:20:59.080
Dad wanted to make a bar of the ping pong table.

191
00:20:59.240 --> 00:21:03.040
Lucky no one was injured ...

192
00:21:03.200 --> 00:21:07.400
What idea did he have yesterday?
 Family Day?
 Again?

193
00:21:07.560 --> 00:21:13.720
Dad has a lot at work and has not become accustomed to the new neighbors.

194
00:21:13.880 --> 00:21:20.200
Sorry darling.
 It got stupid yesterday but we can't ignore the neighbors.

195
00:21:20.360 --> 00:21:27.080
- We might have the family's day now?
 - Unfortunately, family day is over.

196
00:21:27.240 --> 00:21:33.840
- Now I should do something important.
 -Yourself?

197
00:21:34.000 --> 00:21:39.160
No, our new neighbors.
 Göran - what a guy!

198
00:21:39.320 --> 00:21:43.800
He came here yesterday.
 Then we sat in the sauna for five hours.

199
00:21:43.960 --> 00:21:50.320
- Did you know what I discovered?
 - It's hard to sleep at 100 degrees?

200
00:21:50.480 --> 00:21:57.120
No, Göran is a healthy and sympathetic guy.
 A little overpaid just ...

201
00:21:57.280 --> 00:22:02.800
- So we can spend time with them normally?
 -Absolutely.

202
00:22:02.960 --> 00:22:08.240
Göran is interesting.
 He has worked for a year in Dubai!

203
00:22:08.400 --> 00:22:12.600
Did you tell us about your year in Värnamo?

204
00:22:12.760 --> 00:22:20.720
Yesterday was Göran the devil's envoy.
 Now you are friends.
 What has happened?

205
00:22:20.880 --> 00:22:25.920
- Oh, it is nine!
 -What is this?

206
00:22:26.080 --> 00:22:30.840
Dear Family - We'll have a sauna!

207
00:22:35.400 --> 00:22:42.200
- Göran, do you have time with this?
 - Yes, before there is a spin at the company.

208
00:22:42.360 --> 00:22:46.880
I can't believe it's true.
 Thanks!

209
00:22:47.040 --> 00:22:54.720
As Gustav said: Neighborhood is like a flower - the more care, the more beautiful.

210
00:22:56.240 --> 00:23:00.400
As true as it is said!

211
00:23:00.560 --> 00:23:04.920
Ok, the builder.
 Down in the basement again!

212
00:23:05.080 --> 00:23:10.920
Didn't you think Dad was such a fixer?

213
00:23:11.080 --> 00:23:16.000
- Don't you help him?
 - If he shouts, I'll come!

214
00:23:19.320 --> 00:23:25.960
- When Göran comes back?
 - He is in town and comes soon.

215
00:23:26.120 --> 00:23:32.000
- Can't you go down and work yourself?
 - I have a break.

216
00:23:32.160 --> 00:23:36.440
Coffee is good when you have worn all morning.

217
00:23:36.600 --> 00:23:42.640
-What have you done?
 Lit the light?
 -Yes.
 He came early!

218
00:23:42.800 --> 00:23:47.840
How long does this take?
 We've had it like this for three days.

219
00:23:48.000 --> 00:23:54.240
Honey, when we sit in the heat we forget that.

220
00:23:54.400 --> 00:23:59.920
- Imagine that it got rid of!
 Own sauna.
 - It feels unreal.

221
00:24:00.080 --> 00:24:07.640
When Göran is done with the sauna, shouldn't we ask him to build a sky bed?

222
00:24:07.800 --> 00:24:14.320
- Göran is kind.
 Don't take advantage of it!
 -Use?
 He thinks it's fun.

223
00:24:14.480 --> 00:24:20.320
-Hello!
 Do you know what has happened?
 - The assembly came this morning ...

224
00:24:20.480 --> 00:24:27.160
I got my first job.
 Three weeks full time and well paid!

225
00:24:27.320 --> 00:24:33.400
- We start tomorrow morning.
 - You should pull the pipes then!

226
00:24:33.560 --> 00:24:39.080
The only thing you need to think about is to bend the pipes -

227
00:24:39.240 --> 00:24:43.480
- And to solder the main circles.

228
00:24:43.640 --> 00:24:49.720
- I have no education at this!
 - You have no education at all.

229
00:24:49.880 --> 00:24:55.160
We would build together.
 You do not fail a friend!

230
00:24:55.320 --> 00:25:00.800
You can come at any time.
 I'm sitting one floor above you.

231
00:25:00.960 --> 00:25:06.520
At the postoffice!
 I'm going to tear out the worn cafeteria!

232
00:25:06.680 --> 00:25:10.560
Now it is best that you go, Göran.

233
00:25:10.720 --> 00:25:15.840
Now we are workmates too!

234
00:25:16.000 --> 00:25:20.600
There you see!
 What did I say!

235
00:25:20.760 --> 00:25:26.400
Chevrolet!
 You can't trust such people!

236
00:25:26.560 --> 00:25:29.720
Call a construction company.

237
00:25:29.880 --> 00:25:35.720
- Building company?
 We can not afford!
 -I can afford.
 Ring!!!

238
00:25:46.120 --> 00:25:50.480
Tjena, Pettersson, we shit in the old coffee room.

239
00:25:50.640 --> 00:25:54.920
Have you bent tubes sometime?

240
00:26:31.480 --> 00:26:33.720
