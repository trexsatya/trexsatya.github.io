1
00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:09.560
Kristina ...

2
00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:14.880
We have been together for a long time now ...

3
00:00:15.040 --> 00:00:20.440
... but it has not been so exciting in bed lately.

4
00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:25.440
-No.
 - You might be able to live it up a bit.

5
00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:30.600
I bought a toy for us.

6
00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:55.280
You ... I have a radish in the jacket.

7
00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:04.240
The radish is angry.

8
00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:13.800
Angry!
 The radish is very angry on you.
 An angry radish!

9
00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:15.960
Grrr!

10
00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:28.280
But you should not stand here and freeze with the Tjillevippen bar!

11
00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:34.360
Hang with me home so you can get a grogg and a hot bath instead.

12
00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:38.560
I talk to you!
 Come back!

13
00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:43.840
Can you keep a secret?

14
00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:49.680
- I am thinking of free to Frida.
 - But God, what fun!

15
00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:57.240
- Congratulations, Magnus!
 How are you going to do?
 -I do not know.

16
00:02:57.400 --> 00:03:03.280
It must be a memory for the life of Frida.
 Think like this:

17
00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:09.360
Frida is alone at home.
 Suddenly she hears someone singing opera.

18
00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:14.000
She looks out and sees you singing opera from the roof hatch on a limousine!

19
00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:18.240
You are climbing up for the fire steps and frees.

20
00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:22.560
- Isn't that out of Pretty Woman?
 -Yes!
 The world's best movie!

21
00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:25.880
Ulf, how did you free?

22
00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:31.320
You have to build excitement and then surprise.

23
00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:36.600
I was out partying and didn't come home all night.

24
00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:41.800
She became very worried and thought that an accident happened.

25
00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:46.960
At dawn it rang on the door, and outside were two police officers -

26
00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:52.120
- Two friends to me, and said that an accident happened ...

27
00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:57.480
She had to accompany them to the BÃ¥rhuset for identification.

28
00:03:57.640 --> 00:04:04.400
There, under a sheet, I lay.
 She removed the sheet and was devastated!

29
00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:09.640
Then I shouted, "Kristina, do you want to marry me?"

30
00:04:11.240 --> 00:04:15.520
- Was it successful?
 - No, not as I had thought.

31
00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:24.880
- I don't know where to start ... - take it easy!
 One thing at a time.

32
00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:28.120
He was completely naked under the rock.

33
00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:31.960
You saw the whole lollipop and everything.

34
00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:37.760
- How did he look otherwise?
 - Card and with medium blond hair.

35
00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:44.280
- Underwhelmed.
 Do you know who he is then?
 - I have to look at it later.

36
00:04:44.440 --> 00:04:49.760
- Do you have any register?
 - Yes, we have some information.

37
00:04:49.920 --> 00:04:55.400
-Phone number?
 E -mail address?
 -No I do not think so.

38
00:06:19.080 --> 00:06:25.840
- You should bake as often as you can!
 - You might as well buy?

39
00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:30.200
Do you hear!
 Would you be able to fold out?

40
00:06:31.240 --> 00:06:35.680
- Well!
 If I got the chance!
 -No.

41
00:06:35.840 --> 00:06:42.800
Sometimes you may not get the chance, but you have to take it, as the girl said.

42
00:06:42.960 --> 00:06:47.320
Think about how many would see you naked.

43
00:06:47.480 --> 00:06:54.320
All children would say, "Why doesn't the aunt have any clothes on?"

44
00:06:54.480 --> 00:06:59.480
- Her god, the kids!
 - Children are natural creatures.

45
00:06:59.640 --> 00:07:03.800
- They are naked all the time.
 -Yes is not it!

46
00:07:03.960 --> 00:07:09.760
Utvik is a way to market who I am and what I do!

47
00:07:09.920 --> 00:07:15.320
- You work as a teacher, Jenny.
 - All professions need a little puff.

48
00:07:15.480 --> 00:07:19.680
Exactly!
 It is an interview too.

49
00:07:19.840 --> 00:07:25.120
- Don't you want to be a role model?
 - Just that, a role model.

50
00:07:25.280 --> 00:07:28.480
I want to be with my calendar.

51
00:07:28.640 --> 00:07:31.800
"Ulf - Inner Seller of the Year 2004."

52
00:07:34.880 --> 00:07:40.720
Twelve months, twelve pictures, an easy -to -dress Ulf - which God created me.

53
00:07:40.880 --> 00:07:46.200
The products are in focus, it's advertising ...

54
00:07:46.360 --> 00:07:49.680
You can get some items.

55
00:07:49.840 --> 00:07:53.240
- Kristina!
 - We have more at home.

56
00:07:53.400 --> 00:07:56.400
Magnus, bring one to the company.

57
00:07:56.560 --> 00:08:01.200
You can send them to your loved ones.

58
00:08:01.360 --> 00:08:05.720
It's not so stupid.
 You can have it in the teacher room.

59
00:09:17.320 --> 00:09:21.960
- Imagine that it really will get rid of!
 -I love you.

60
00:09:22.120 --> 00:09:28.760
Then the menu is finished.
 Should we fill in the name form, so is it done?

61
00:09:28.920 --> 00:09:34.960
What should we be called when we get married?
 We haven't talked about that, huh?

62
00:09:35.120 --> 00:09:42.080
- Do you want to change my name?
 - Yes, it's more practical.

63
00:09:42.240 --> 00:09:47.840
Should I change my name and wipe out my identity?

64
00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:53.280
We don't have to take my last name.
 We can find a new one.

65
00:09:53.440 --> 00:09:57.360
Yes we do.
 We take "Hitler"!

66
00:09:57.520 --> 00:10:03.520
"Frida Hitler. Hello. I'm married to a dictator" -

67
00:10:03.680 --> 00:10:08.040
- "Who wants me to throw my old name."

68
00:10:08.200 --> 00:10:14.120
Or better yet: "Nonym. Hello. Frid - a -Nonym!"

69
00:10:14.280 --> 00:10:20.680
Do you want that?
 So it will be.
 You may want to block me?

70
00:10:20.840 --> 00:10:25.920
We take the name "idiot".
 I will be called since I married you!

71
00:10:26.080 --> 00:10:31.000
- "Frida unsatisfied".
 - "Magnus tormented by his frozen".

72
00:10:31.160 --> 00:10:34.960
- I want to divorce!
 -Me too!

73
00:10:50.360 --> 00:10:53.720
My life is so bad, Carita.

74
00:10:53.880 --> 00:10:57.520
But Per -Arne, what are you saying?

75
00:10:57.680 --> 00:11:03.920
- I don't live fully.
 - But Per - Arne!

76
00:11:04.720 --> 00:11:11.240
Sometimes I wish I was someone else.
 A young and strong man-

77
00:11:11.400 --> 00:11:17.080
- As takes the initiative and is respected and successful.

78
00:11:17.240 --> 00:11:23.240
But Per -Arne, it's yourself you describe!

79
00:11:23.400 --> 00:11:26.080
What do you say, Carita?

80
00:11:26.240 --> 00:11:30.440
You could not describe yourself in better words.

81
00:11:30.600 --> 00:11:37.120
- Do you own it?
 - Yes, I do, Per -Arne.

82
00:11:37.280 --> 00:11:40.440
Yes, so you can feel there ...

83
00:11:40.600 --> 00:11:47.120
... that you would like to be such a successful person ...

84
00:11:47.280 --> 00:11:52.880
Be so beautiful and good and ... yes, so there ...

85
00:11:53.040 --> 00:11:59.960
Not everyone can be, Carita.
 There are few people spoiled.

86
00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:08.520
But another ... yes, you!
 There you are in shelter!

87
00:12:09.160 --> 00:12:13.600
- It's been a nice wedding day.
 -Yes actually.

88
00:12:13.760 --> 00:12:17.520
- And it's not over yet.
 -No...

89
00:12:17.680 --> 00:12:21.520
I'll be coming to you soon, Kristina.

90
00:12:21.680 --> 00:12:27.680
I'll just fix one thing.
 I have got such hard skin under the soles of the feet.

91
00:12:32.400 --> 00:12:35.880
Imagine that dead skin can be so hard.

92
00:13:01.840 --> 00:13:06.880
- Are you in a good mood today?
 - Yes, I was on a date this weekend.

93
00:13:07.040 --> 00:13:10.440
I met an amazing woman!

94
00:13:10.600 --> 00:13:16.560
- Is it anyone I know?
 -Yes actually.
 Her name is Gunnel.

95
00:13:16.720 --> 00:13:23.040
- It's my mother too.
 -Just.
 It's your mom.

96
00:13:23.200 --> 00:13:27.560
What the hell ... Have you met my mom?

97
00:13:27.720 --> 00:13:34.280
I don't usually go all the way the first evening, but now everything was right!

98
00:13:36.120 --> 00:13:41.680
- What the hell are you saying?
 - We have loved each other.

99
00:13:42.960 --> 00:13:46.200
How did it happen?

100
00:13:46.360 --> 00:13:52.160
When two adults like each other and hug close ...

101
00:13:52.320 --> 00:13:57.440
--... So the father's snoop can grow ... - How have you met her?!

102
00:13:57.600 --> 00:14:00.760
It said click on your birthday party.

103
00:14:00.920 --> 00:14:06.200
- Now when she divorced from Lennart ... - from my dad!

104
00:14:06.360 --> 00:14:13.480
He did not affirm her femininity.
 He couldn't give her pleasure.

105
00:14:13.640 --> 00:14:20.440
I think you will see my and Gunnel's relationship as something beautiful.

106
00:14:22.400 --> 00:14:27.720
- It's a lot to melt.
 -Yes I understand that.

107
00:14:27.880 --> 00:14:34.120
It must take the time it takes.
 Now that we still talk about it ....

108
00:14:34.280 --> 00:14:40.120
Can you stay away this weekend?
 We want to spend time on your hand.

109
00:14:44.200 --> 00:14:49.800
Is not it nice?
 You are the apple of my eye.

110
00:14:50.840 --> 00:14:57.160
- Should we go through the budget again?
 - Why did you free if we can't afford it?

111
00:14:57.320 --> 00:15:01.840
I did not know that we would pay the makeup and the hairdresser's living.

112
00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:08.280
- Don't you want me to be nice?
 - Yes, but we have to cut down on something.

113
00:15:08.440 --> 00:15:13.960
- Did we have to have real champagne?
 - No, we can have rosehip soup.

114
00:15:14.120 --> 00:15:19.240
- "Oh, what original!"
 - Now you are a little ridiculous.

115
00:15:19.400 --> 00:15:26.400
We can buy the rings in a chewing gum automatic and save a lot!

116
00:15:26.560 --> 00:15:31.920
Or buy a regular, great ring that does not have a carat diamond.

117
00:15:32.080 --> 00:15:38.640
We can save on the wedding dress and be naked - "clothing: nothing!"

118
00:15:38.800 --> 00:15:42.840
- Will you be happy then?
 - Okay, we take a really long loan.

119
00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:48.240
- The wedding trip goes to Osby!
 -That's it!
 I want to get divorced!

120
00:15:48.400 --> 00:15:51.880
Great idea!
 Me too.

121
00:15:52.880 --> 00:15:56.480
You?
 What is it, the guy?

122
00:15:56.640 --> 00:16:00.800
Tiger?
 You like football, huh?

123
00:16:02.960 --> 00:16:08.480
- I have tickets to the derby.
 - You're not my dad!

124
00:16:33.240 --> 00:16:39.160
Do you know, this will be the happiest day of our entire life.

125
00:16:40.960 --> 00:16:46.960
Now to the difficult.
 Who should we iron?
 We can only fit with 80 people.

126
00:16:47.120 --> 00:16:52.400
- How many we have on the list?
 â103.

127
00:16:53.920 --> 00:16:57.520
- This is not easy.
 -No.

128
00:16:57.680 --> 00:17:01.920
Is it anyone you can iron, purely spontaneously?

129
00:17:03.120 --> 00:17:06.880
Family, related ... No, it will be difficult.

130
00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:11.880
- It would be Anders.
 - He is one of my best friends!

131
00:17:12.040 --> 00:17:17.280
- You know how he gets when he drinks.
 - He talks and is very funny.

132
00:17:17.440 --> 00:17:23.080
- What else should we delete?
 - I like to iron Robert.

133
00:17:23.240 --> 00:17:27.440
It's a bit hard for your old boyfriend to come ...

134
00:17:27.600 --> 00:17:31.840
-We are friends!
 - To my friends, I must say:

135
00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:36.520
"This is Robert, he has seen my wife naked."

136
00:17:36.680 --> 00:17:40.560
- Then we iron him, then.
 -Thanks.

137
00:17:41.800 --> 00:17:45.280
Then I iron ... Ulrika.

138
00:17:45.440 --> 00:17:50.920
-My sister?
 - She will be acidic all evening.

139
00:17:51.080 --> 00:17:55.120
- No Robert - no Ulrika.
 - It's my sister.

140
00:17:55.280 --> 00:17:59.800
- POFF!
 There, Ulrika smoked.
 - Then I ask to have Amanda.

141
00:17:59.960 --> 00:18:05.520
"Why do I never meet a normal guy?"
 - "Because you're stupid in your head!"

142
00:18:06.840 --> 00:18:14.040
Then I delete your countryiscs, so we all avoid stonewashed jeans.

143
00:18:14.640 --> 00:18:16.840
So!
 POFF!

144
00:18:17.000 --> 00:18:21.400
There your aunts disappeared, then the spirits are enough.

145
00:18:21.560 --> 00:18:27.000
POFF!
 There, your parents smoked.
 Now we are 80. Are you satisfied now?

146
00:18:27.160 --> 00:18:30.360
- I want to divorce!
 -Me too!

147
00:18:31.640 --> 00:18:34.640
Now to Bosses spark plug school!

148
00:18:36.480 --> 00:18:38.960
Conny!

149
00:18:39.120 --> 00:18:42.320
Do I look fat in this one?

150
00:18:53.560 --> 00:18:56.600
-Hello!
 -Hey!

151
00:18:56.760 --> 00:19:01.560
Forgive me for being late.
 I cut myself when I shaved.

152
00:19:01.720 --> 00:19:06.200
I also cut myself before, but then I changed shaving delights.

153
00:19:06.360 --> 00:19:09.440
I am smooth like a children's butt.

154
00:19:09.600 --> 00:19:13.920
- Feel!
 - No, I can imagine.

155
00:19:16.080 --> 00:19:19.720
Hello!
 Have you ordered a table?

156
00:19:19.880 --> 00:19:25.040
--Ulf and Magnus.
 - Here everyone is welcome.

157
00:19:34.480 --> 00:19:40.040
We have slightly different menus to choose from.
 We have the "business menu" ...

158
00:19:40.200 --> 00:19:43.720
... "The Jubilee menu", "The Spring Menu" ...

159
00:19:44.040 --> 00:19:49.560
- This looks delicious.
 - It's "the love menu".

160
00:19:50.400 --> 00:19:54.960
- Champagne and grated lobster.
 --Ulf, not the love menu.

161
00:19:55.120 --> 00:19:59.840
- Should we not have a gratin lobster?
 -Okay.

162
00:20:01.920 --> 00:20:07.160
It is noticeable who is the gentleman in the house.
 Congratulations.

163
00:20:07.320 --> 00:20:12.760
It's nothing strange to us.
 There is nothing strange with us two.

164
00:20:14.280 --> 00:20:16.360
No...

165
00:20:27.040 --> 00:20:30.800
Do you see anything new with me?

166
00:20:30.960 --> 00:20:33.240
No.

167
00:20:34.240 --> 00:20:36.520
Nothing?

168
00:20:36.680 --> 00:20:41.000
Well ... have you done anything with your hair?

169
00:20:42.640 --> 00:20:46.120
I bought a new can!

170
00:20:47.640 --> 00:20:50.680
Yes Yes.
 It was nice!

171
00:20:50.840 --> 00:20:53.960
- Nice, Britt.
 -Do you think so?

172
00:20:54.760 --> 00:21:00.920
I need a taste advice.
 Kristina and I celebrate the six -year anniversary on Tuesday.

173
00:21:01.080 --> 00:21:06.640
I bought a little thing.
 What do you say about this one?

174
00:21:07.680 --> 00:21:11.040
I'm not an expert, but ...

175
00:21:11.200 --> 00:21:16.280
Oh this night this lovely night

176
00:21:16.440 --> 00:21:21.520
As we call Bella Notte

177
00:22:00.560 --> 00:22:04.840
- The servitude was a bit strange.
 - I think the service was great.

178
00:22:05.000 --> 00:22:10.640
I got a feeling that the waitress thought we were a couple.

179
00:22:10.800 --> 00:22:14.880
- We are not gay at all.
 - No, not a dew gay.

180
00:22:15.040 --> 00:22:18.240
But the idea is quite exciting.

181
00:22:53.120 --> 00:22:56.360
There are good features out there.

182
00:22:58.560 --> 00:23:00.400
Livat.

183
00:23:02.960 --> 00:23:06.400
It's good island.

184
00:23:08.520 --> 00:23:11.800
There are good features out there!

185
00:23:11.960 --> 00:23:14.240
Livat.

186
00:23:17.040 --> 00:23:22.280
- Britt, come on now!
 - I don't want to come along.

187
00:23:22.440 --> 00:23:24.600
British ...

188
00:23:24.760 --> 00:23:29.600
- I don't look wise.
 - Lasse and Inger are waiting.

189
00:23:29.760 --> 00:23:35.000
I have a pimple on my nose.
 I look like a stop light.

190
00:23:48.320 --> 00:23:52.800
Masquerade!
 Welcome!

191
00:23:52.960 --> 00:23:58.160
- What did you dress up for?
 - Don't you see it?
 I'm clown.

192
00:23:58.320 --> 00:24:04.800
-Hello!
 Hello!
 -Gosh!
 Nice costume!

193
00:24:04.960 --> 00:24:09.760
- What are you dressed up for, Ulf?
 - Don't you see it?

194
00:24:09.920 --> 00:24:14.400
She who was on TV before ... Rosanne!

195
00:24:18.520 --> 00:24:22.280
You should not be Peter Harryson anyway!

196
00:24:22.440 --> 00:24:27.160
I'm you!
 Don't you recognize yourself?

197
00:24:30.040 --> 00:24:33.560
Now Jenny is coming.
 - Hello!

198
00:24:34.760 --> 00:24:37.760
What a coincidence.

199
00:24:37.920 --> 00:24:42.720
- This is Isaac, my new guy.
 -Hello.
 What are you dressed up for?

200
00:24:42.880 --> 00:24:48.640
- I couldn't dress up.
 - Isak works as a rabbi.

201
00:24:51.920 --> 00:24:55.600
Sieg Heil!
 Achtung!
 All the Jew Raus!

202
00:25:00.040 --> 00:25:01.840
What then?

203
00:25:02.000 --> 00:25:07.080
Come in!
 - Magnus, coffee?

204
00:25:07.240 --> 00:25:11.680
- Britt, you are a wonderful woman.
 - Are you holding it, Conny?

205
00:25:11.840 --> 00:25:15.520
Can't take off your can tonight?

206
00:25:15.680 --> 00:25:20.720
- I don't know if I pallet.
 - But it was so long ago, Britt.

207
00:25:21.920 --> 00:25:25.080
Just for my sake, Britt.

208
00:25:30.800 --> 00:25:35.680
-Who are you?
 - I'm Leif.

209
00:25:35.840 --> 00:25:40.840
- Where is Britt?
 - She left two years ago.

210
00:25:41.640 --> 00:25:47.040
Two years ago?
 That time last fall at Birka Princess, then ...?

211
00:25:47.200 --> 00:25:50.080
Sure it was wonderful.

212
00:26:18.280 --> 00:26:21.520
Love Hurts

213
00:26:21.680 --> 00:26:25.120
Love Scars ...

214
00:26:25.840 --> 00:26:31.320
It is the person behind the can that you fall in love with.

216
00:27:07.160 --> 00:27:12.480
Oh, you're so nice, Ulf.
 I want you!

217
00:27:12.640 --> 00:27:16.280
You are so sexy.
 Take me!

218
00:27:22.200 --> 00:27:25.760
- What is it, Kristina?
 - I dreamed a nightmare.
