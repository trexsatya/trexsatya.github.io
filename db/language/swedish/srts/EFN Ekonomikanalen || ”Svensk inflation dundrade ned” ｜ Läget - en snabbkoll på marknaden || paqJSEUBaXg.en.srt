00:00:03,880 --> 00:00:08,280
Who is the Fed Manager Jay Powell?
 Once he has fought inflation-

2
00:00:08,360 --> 00:00:12,680
-The he often mentioned old Fed chief Paul Volcker as a role model.

3
00:00:12,760 --> 00:00:15,760
Volcker stomped out inflation in the 80s-

4
00:00:15,840 --> 00:00:21,240
-And did not withdraw to create multiple recessions.
 But yesterday Powell took rather on-

5
00:00:21,320 --> 00:00:24,880
-Tom clothing.
 The market had tense arc-

6
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:30,560
-Prissed many interest rates in 2024 and Fed confirmed everything.

7
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:35,120
Inflation is on its way down.
 There is no reason to keep the interest rate for high-

8
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:38,760
-When inflation falls, interest rate cuts are coming.

9
00:00:38,840 --> 00:00:45,200
And the market rushed.
 Exchange up, interest rates down, everything is ready for Christmas.

10
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:51,640
I guess Jay Powell didn't get up in the middle of the night-

11
00:00:51,720 --> 00:00:55,400
-To see Swedish inflation figures this morning.
 But had he seen them-

12
00:00:55,480 --> 00:01:00,560
-They he probably nodded satisfied.
 For Swedish inflation thundered down in November-

13
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:03,320
â€”care than we and the market counted with-

14
00:01:03,400 --> 00:01:08,480
-And perhaps most important, lower than the Riksbank expected.
 The market is concluding

15
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:14,400
-That interest rate cuts come not only in the United States and Europe, but to a large extent also-

16
00:01:14,480 --> 00:01:21,440
-During 2024 in Sweden.
 At least 150 points, 1.5 percentage points are now pricat-

17
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:25,880
-In Swedish interest rate curve in the form of interest rate cuts in 2024.
