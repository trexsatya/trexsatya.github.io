Hello!
 How is it?

2
00:00:02,873 --> 00:00:07,264
That's good, thank you!
 How are you?

3
00:00:07,395 --> 00:00:10,192
It's just good, thank you!
 Where are you going?

4
00:00:10,263 --> 00:00:12,972
I'll go to a clothing store.

5
00:00:12,973 --> 00:00:15,277
I'm going to buy a sweater.

6
00:00:15,321 --> 00:00:17,574
I need a new sweater.

7
00:00:17,575 --> 00:00:19,006
Do you want to come?

8
00:00:19,007 --> 00:00:20,805
Gladly!

9
00:00:20,861 --> 00:00:22,405
Come then!

10
00:00:48,367 --> 00:00:52,759
A child cries.

11
00:01:02,211 --> 00:01:04,236
Need help?

12
00:01:04,293 --> 00:01:07,710
No thanks!
 I am just looking.

13
00:01:13,925 --> 00:01:18,818
I walk around the store and look at all the clothes.

14
00:01:27,611 --> 00:01:29,345
It was good looking!

15
00:01:29,346 --> 00:01:31,346
What do you think about this?

16
00:01:31,347 --> 00:01:33,765
Very hot!

17
00:01:33,766 --> 00:01:36,171
I take and try.

18
00:01:36,380 --> 00:01:39,139
I take some sizes.

19
00:01:40,070 --> 00:01:43,348
We'll see which one fits.

20
00:01:51,365 --> 00:01:55,288
Where is the fitting room?

21
00:01:57,001 --> 00:02:00,671
The test room is located over there!

22
00:02:01,061 --> 00:02:03,883
Where?
 OK, then we go there.

23
00:02:07,774 --> 00:02:11,685
a fitting room

24
00:02:17,376 --> 00:02:21,185
I try this size first.

25
00:02:21,584 --> 00:02:25,077
What is the size?

26
00:02:25,469 --> 00:02:29,569
It is size L.

27
00:02:31,065 --> 00:02:33,000
Does it fit?

28
00:02:33,001 --> 00:02:36,077
No, it doesn't fit well.

29
00:02:36,078 --> 00:02:37,091
Why?

30
00:02:37,092 --> 00:02:41,888
It's too big, look!

31
00:02:42,001 --> 00:02:45,115
I try another size.

32
00:02:47,323 --> 00:02:51,201
I try size S.

33
00:02:54,055 --> 00:02:55,410
Does it fit?

34
00:02:55,479 --> 00:02:58,529
No, it doesn't fit well.

35
00:02:58,530 --> 00:03:00,188
Why?

36
00:03:00,283 --> 00:03:03,662
It's too small!

37
00:03:05,102 --> 00:03:07,671
I try a pineapple size.

38
00:03:07,799 --> 00:03:11,242
I'll try size M.

39
00:03:13,180 --> 00:03:14,868
Does it fit?

40
00:03:15,001 --> 00:03:18,545
Yes it fits well.

41
00:03:18,914 --> 00:03:22,002
Look!
 Is not it nice?

42
00:03:22,104 --> 00:03:24,104
It looks great!

43
00:03:24,339 --> 00:03:26,048
I take it!

44
00:03:26,219 --> 00:03:28,447
It's the right size!

45
00:03:28,704 --> 00:03:32,893
It's really pretty!
 I take it!

46
00:03:35,919 --> 00:03:37,805
How much does it cost?

47
00:03:37,806 --> 00:03:43,172
It costs SEK 299

48
00:03:43,267 --> 00:03:48,000
And that's a discount!

49
00:03:48,917 --> 00:03:52,208
So it costs ....

50
00:03:55,890 --> 00:03:57,688
Great price!

51
00:03:57,689 --> 00:03:59,689
I take it!

52
00:04:05,344 --> 00:04:07,002
Are you happy now?

53
00:04:07,097 --> 00:04:09,742
Yes, I'm really happy!

54
00:04:09,850 --> 00:04:13,255
Now I have a new nice sweater.
