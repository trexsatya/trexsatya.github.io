1
00:00:06.580 --> 00:00:10.360
Zingo, spin around.

2
00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:20.260
Do you want something good

3
00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:26.540
Here you go.

4
00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:34.260
He is quite disobedient.

5
00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:48.960
This is Roboth Duke Duke ... which Alma has tested in collaboration with Silverlit.

6
00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:59.540
If you saw "What's in the box" a few weeks ago you know we tested Robo Kombat, which became Harry's favorite.

7
00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:06.480
 Should we turn him off, right?
 - Yes, we turn him off.

8
00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:09.260
So, turned off.
 Fy.

9
00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:17.260
Here it says "Duke", but Alma has named him Zingo.
 One records different ... what is it called

10
00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:20.160
It is called...

11
00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:27.700
When dressing, what is it called call?
 No.
 "Commands" is called in English.

12
00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:29.940
Yes, "Commands".

13
00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:36.060
Then the dog should do as you please, and it works pretty well.

14
00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:40.160
Yes, but I'd rather have a real dog.

15
00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:48.100
Yes of course.
 It brings us into today's question, we will start this vlog with a day of the day.

16
00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:53.920
Elina Larsson wonders: "Do you want some pets".

17
00:01:53.920 --> 00:02:00.760
 Harry, you may start.
 - I want...

18
00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:05.160
I have to think.

19
00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:08.680
 Should I begin?
 So you have to think a little.
 - Yes.

20
00:02:08.680 --> 00:02:13.440
I want a rabbit, a cat or a dog.

21
00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:19.360
It doesn't matter what it is, but I still want something of it.

22
00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:23.480
 Cat.
 - Cat, yes.

23
00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:31.440
Axel and I can definitely think of pets, but not when we are just about to travel, and not when we live in town.

24
00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:36.020
We think that if we move to a house, you should definitely get pets.

25
00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:39.880
 When we move home.
 - No, not when we move home to the apartment.

26
00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:45.280
 Huh?
 - No, in houses so the animal can run out, it's nice.

27
00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:50.680
Yes, even if it is an indoor cat or an indoor dog or whatever it is.

28
00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:55.400
 For so long, such a thing is pretty good.
 - Yes.

29
00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:57.400
A robot dog.

30
00:02:57.400 --> 00:03:05.600
From one animal to the other now we are going to the stable.
 Should it be fun, right?

31
00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:07.840
Yes

32
00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:17.520
Alma has attended riding school during the fall.
 Many of you have asked to see a vlog when we ride.

33
00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:22.780
We asked Alma's riding school and they did not want us to film.

34
00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:27.040
So we went out with a search on our Instagram.

35
00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:30.040
 Worst best thing.
 - Yes indeed.

36
00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:38.100
A girl named Emelie heard from us, so now we are on our way to her stable, Hästravaganza.

37
00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:39.620
Yay

38
00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:44.520
And ... Harry will try to ride for the first time

39
00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:55.020
For the first time Yeah, Yeah, Yeah, Yeah, Yeah!

40
00:03:55.300 --> 00:04:02.620
I don't know the horses and I've never been there before, so it gets a little ... nervous.

41
00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:05.600
Merry Christmas (Merry Christmas)

42
00:04:07.940 --> 00:04:09.940
Hello

43
00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:14.440
 Dad.
 - Hi, Harry.

44
00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:17.600
 Welcome to Hästravaganza.
 - Thanks!

45
00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:21.280
We have the horses ready for you, we'll pick them up

46
00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:28.220
What a luxury, Alma you do not need to sm in and scratch hoofs.

47
00:04:29.140 --> 00:04:36.320
 In here we have stuff to borrow.
 - Oh, what a lot.

48
00:04:40.540 --> 00:04:44.900
 Then we will see what we can find.
 - Different vests, here.

49
00:04:44.900 --> 00:04:49.260
Yes exactly.
 Here we have the most common.

50
00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:54.560
Oh...

51
00:04:54.560 --> 00:04:57.500
Oh, how hard it was.

52
00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:01.000
Ouch.

53
00:05:07.740 --> 00:05:11.160
Fully equipped.

54
00:05:12.980 --> 00:05:15.740
 Is this here we should?
 - Yes.

55
00:05:19.140 --> 00:05:25.800
Here we have Erik.
 He will have today, he is a Norwegian fjord horse, an older gentleman.

56
00:05:25.800 --> 00:05:28.700
 Hello Hello.
 - Hello Hello.

57
00:05:31.020 --> 00:05:34.960
He didn't wave back.

58
00:05:35.160 --> 00:05:40.100
Waving you have to wave back.

59
00:05:44.840 --> 00:05:48.200
Here we have Dorina.

60
00:05:49.060 --> 00:05:52.400
Hi, Dorina.

61
00:05:55.360 --> 00:06:06.420
 They are a little bigger than you are used to, Alma.
 - Yes exactly.
 Dorina is a Schwarzwald horse.

62
00:06:07.100 --> 00:06:13.100
 Are you nervous?
 - No, I'm afraid.
 Scared, scared!

63
00:06:14.460 --> 00:06:19.980
She is very brilliant, she loves people.

64
00:06:19.980 --> 00:06:22.080
And food.

65
00:06:22.080 --> 00:06:24.980
 Are you going to kiss her?
 - No!

66
00:06:24.980 --> 00:06:26.880
Should I kiss her?
 - Yes.

67
00:06:26.880 --> 00:06:32.720
No thanks, preferably not.
 But I can pat her a little.

68
00:06:41.960 --> 00:06:45.200
 How's it going?
 - Good.

69
00:06:45.200 --> 00:06:49.380
Oh there is the track.

70
00:07:01.840 --> 00:07:06.420
In with the foot here.
 Nice.

71
00:07:06.600 --> 00:07:09.620
Nice, Alma.

72
00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:15.240
You must not roll down now.

73
00:07:15.420 --> 00:07:19.120
Are you ready

74
00:07:23.520 --> 00:07:26.580
Brave

75
00:07:27.960 --> 00:07:30.100
Brave

76
00:07:30.100 --> 00:07:35.300
Brave, brave, brave, brave, brave ...

77
00:07:35.480 --> 00:07:41.560
 Are you going to come to this pallet, or are you good there?
 - I'm good here.

78
00:07:41.560 --> 00:07:46.620
Okay, then we come to that pallet.

79
00:07:46.840 --> 00:07:52.480
Oh ... This is going to be a little difficult to get up.

80
00:07:52.660 --> 00:07:59.100
 Stop the foot in this, left foot.
 - The second foot.

81
00:07:59.480 --> 00:08:03.860
So, and then over with the leg.

82
00:08:04.020 --> 00:08:11.460
 What should I hold?
 - Either in the saddle or in the handle here.

83
00:08:11.800 --> 00:08:20.160
 I think I need to tighten ... Well, it's at Max.
 - We have to spin a lap until then only.

84
00:08:20.300 --> 00:08:22.120
So there.

85
00:08:22.560 --> 00:08:25.220
Oooo ...

86
00:08:25.280 --> 00:08:31.360
 Does it feel cool?
 How far up you are!
 - I'm bigger than you.

87
00:08:31.360 --> 00:08:33.960
Yes you are.

88
00:08:36.360 --> 00:08:42.240
I think this is a sport for Harry.
 I think he will love this.

89
00:08:43.140 --> 00:08:51.360
 Should I drive now, Dad?
 - Just right, we'll just fix this one too.

90
00:08:51.880 --> 00:08:58.620
 This is really scary.
 - How kind she is who just stands still waiting.

91
00:09:00.640 --> 00:09:03.100
Let's go.

92
00:09:03.800 --> 00:09:06.940
Yeehaw

93
00:09:12.200 --> 00:09:15.300
Alma Alma!

94
00:09:21.040 --> 00:09:26.500
 Straight in the saddle.
 Does it feel good?
 - Yes.

95
00:09:26.920 --> 00:09:33.340
 There are a little bigger movements on a larger horse, right?
 - mm.

96
00:09:52.160 --> 00:09:57.760
Up for the hill we lean a little forward.
 Grab the horse's man, ie in the horse's hair.

97
00:09:57.760 --> 00:10:04.320
And then we stand in the stirrups so the butt leaves the saddle.
 Up and stand.

98
00:10:04.840 --> 00:10:08.360
And then we step up the hill.

99
00:10:44.320 --> 00:10:50.140
 That was scary.
 - Like a roller coaster.

100
00:10:51.140 --> 00:10:54.200
Yeehaw, mountain and coaster!

101
00:10:54.500 --> 00:10:58.760
Then we take some moves, then.

102
00:10:58.960 --> 00:11:09.860
Yeah-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a ...

103
00:11:09.860 --> 00:11:12.140
Yeehaw

104
00:11:12.300 --> 00:11:19.120
 Alma, has it been more difficult with a bigger horse?
 - No, easier and more fun.

105
00:11:19.300 --> 00:11:25.420
 Why?
 - I don't know, it's just so ... more fun on a bigger horse.

106
00:11:28.240 --> 00:11:30.700
 Hello.
 - Hello.

107
00:11:30.700 --> 00:11:35.720
 Where have you been?
 - I've been and flown drones while you have been riding.

108
00:11:35.880 --> 00:11:46.080
 It seems that the children have had great fun.
 - Yes!
 Top.
 When they trotted ... Harry just "yeehaw!".

109
00:11:46.320 --> 00:11:53.560
Now we will go into the riding house and trot another lap before it is ... clear, or what you say.

110
00:11:53.560 --> 00:11:56.340
It will be great fun to see this material.

111
00:12:32.960 --> 00:12:35.660
We are home.

112
00:12:35.860 --> 00:12:38.080
Yay

113
00:12:38.080 --> 00:12:43.760
At least I, Alma and Harry sitting in there and playing.

114
00:12:43.760 --> 00:12:50.780
Dad Axel went off to have dinner with his dad and sisters, and we went home.

115
00:12:50.900 --> 00:12:54.940
 What do you think of the day?
 - It's been fun.

116
00:12:54.940 --> 00:13:00.740
It was fun to ride on another stable and on other horses, I have to say that.

117
00:13:00.740 --> 00:13:02.940
Very, very fun.

118
00:13:03.120 --> 00:13:05.940
I draw a dog.

119
00:13:06.020 --> 00:13:10.780
It is obedient and it is called sweetie.

120
00:13:10.980 --> 00:13:13.680
 Are you hungry?
 - Yes.

121
00:13:13.780 --> 00:13:20.180
 We will make our own pizza.
 - Yay, yay, yay!

122
00:13:20.920 --> 00:13:27.360
 Harry, come and make pizza with us.
 - No I'm busy.

123
00:13:30.320 --> 00:13:32.360
 You.
 - Yes.

124
00:13:32.360 --> 00:13:37.440
 You are never so busy that you can't eat.
 - But can I play a little while?

125
00:13:37.440 --> 00:13:38.880
No.

126
00:13:38.880 --> 00:13:45.240
 Alma, is it your towel that is here?
 - Oh sorry.
 I happened to forget it.

127
00:13:45.400 --> 00:13:48.460
I showered after the stable.

128
00:13:48.600 --> 00:13:54.760
Harry is starting to make his pizza, and I'm his assistant.

129
00:13:54.920 --> 00:14:00.840
 I need cheese.
 - But Harry, you have to take tomato sauce first.

130
00:14:00.840 --> 00:14:05.140
Yes exactly.
 I had that on my last.

131
00:14:10.260 --> 00:14:15.380
Thanks.
 Sprinkle with it.

132
00:14:18.200 --> 00:14:20.500
So there.

133
00:14:20.700 --> 00:14:27.180
 What was it like to ride?
 - Fun.
 It was the most fun to trot.

134
00:14:27.180 --> 00:14:30.260
Then just ...

135
00:14:31.540 --> 00:14:35.400
And then we ran faster ...

136
00:14:35.820 --> 00:14:39.460
I ran like this.

137
00:14:41.360 --> 00:14:48.660
What was it to say, or do, so the horse would start pile

138
00:14:56.320 --> 00:15:02.200
 Those became great, after all!
 - Mom, can you cut off?
 Here I am on.

139
00:15:02.200 --> 00:15:04.860
Yes, I'll help you.

140
00:15:04.880 --> 00:15:10.460
After all, we always cut the pizza in our family, and eat with our hands.

141
00:15:12.320 --> 00:15:18.640
 Yeah, i'm gonna take my horse to the old town road i'm gonna ride 'ti in can't no more

142
00:15:18.820 --> 00:15:24.780
 Yeah, i'm gonna take my horse to the old town road i'm gonna ride 'ti in can't no more

143
00:15:24.940 --> 00:15:31.620
 I'm gonna ride 'ti in can't no more in got the horses in the back ...

144
00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:40.940
 It was delicious.
 - Yes.

145
00:15:46.620 --> 00:15:52.120
I'm home again.
 The clock is very late, the kids are sleeping.

146
00:15:52.280 --> 00:15:56.480
 What a fun day it was.
 - Yes, it was fun actually.

147
00:15:56.480 --> 00:15:58.900
 Good riding school.
 - Yes.

148
00:15:58.900 --> 00:16:03.520
We have to sleep, we have a lot to fix before the trip now, so ...

149
00:16:03.520 --> 00:16:07.300
So, not now now, but coming days.

150
00:16:07.300 --> 00:16:11.600
Very giant, so we will go into radio shadow a bit.

151
00:16:11.600 --> 00:16:15.740
See you in the next video, thank you for watching this one.

152
00:16:15.740 --> 00:16:20.680
Thumbs up, or down.
 Tell us what you think, leave a comment.

153
00:16:20.680 --> 00:16:25.740
Have a great time until we see you next time.
 bye
