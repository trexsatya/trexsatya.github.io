00:00:00.760 --> 00:00:06.720
In tonight's section of Ifs, the question of all culture in Sweden:

2
00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:10.960
The character chameleon from Botkyrka Thanos Fotas.

3
00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:14.560
The Bollywodan -taking love goddess Meira Omar.

4
00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:20.760
The universe's Swedish Arab Elaf Ali.
 And "my fakking brother" Hassan Ali.

5
00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:23.760
Sweden's most fun Chinese Evelyn Mok.

6
00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:27.760
And brother O from Jordbro - Big O.

7
00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:31.040
The Pang pod pod from Skåne, Cisalli.

8
00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:35.040
Landskrona's acidest Syrian Filip Dikmen.

9
00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:40.480
And last but not least our great leader Ahmed Berhan.

10
00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:47.440
Love may be blind, but we have eight panelists, three competitors -

11
00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:49.840
–And Sweden's best audience.

12
00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:55.160
My name is Ahmed Berhan.
 It's time to meet our competitors.

13
00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:59.520
Representing pink, to everyday uncle blue:

14
00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:03.400
Huddinge's own Axel Foley - Jonas.

15
00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:09.360
Next to him - she makes you make up IRL, she cuts you online.

16
00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:12.920
The giggling make -up Elin!

17
00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:20.400
At the far end of Orange, with Zen-like Aura, HVB Buddist from Borlänge:

18
00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:23.080
Anders.

19
00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:29.040
Najs.
 Jonas, you work as a police officer.

20
00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:34.720
Everyone stopped their drug ... Who do you want to start talking to?

21
00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:38.280
My brother Big O.

22
00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:44.520
As many times as you have stopped me - and now you choose me.

23
00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:48.600
I swear, brother, he has ...

24
00:01:54.640 --> 00:02:00.800
This shabab he is Deli.
 He gets paid just because he is shishko.

25
00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:08.800
- No, but ... - a shisko calls another shisko.

26
00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:14.880
But brother, I'm nice shishko.
 I only eat Lahme.
 Lamb meat, mom meat.

27
00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:21.760
Now back to the question.

28
00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:25.400
Olof K Gustafsson is CEO of Escobar Inc, Yani -

29
00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:31.280
- And he claims that he works for the old cartel king Pablo Escobar.

30
00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:41.040
- But I know the answer to that question.
 - What happy you looked!
 You like him.

31
00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:44.920
He's cool.
 It's true.
 100 %.

32
00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:49.960
As 100 as the coal in his bag.
 It's true.
 Congratulations, Jonas!

33
00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:58.680
That's right.
 He claims to work for the Colombian family Pablo Escobar -

34
00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:02.640
- and represent them.
 Congratulations, Jonas!

35
00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:08.440
Elin!
 Which of our wonderful panelists do you choose?

36
00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:13.000
I've just looked at Love is Blind so I take Meira.

37
00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:17.200
- You take Meira.
 Najs.
 -Pause!

38
00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:22.840
Elin, I have to say you look really blat.

39
00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:27.000
- I am called Andersson, I promise.
 -Where do you live?

40
00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:30.600
This is not love is blind.

41
00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:38.560
Elin ... you chose Meira.
 - Here's the question.

42
00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:43.920
You may have heard Muslim friends say "Astaghfirullah".
 What does it mean?

43
00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:50.320
It is from the beginning an old and in my opinion very outdated expression -

44
00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:55.560
–For a woman who has intercourse outside marriage -

45
00:03:55.720 --> 00:04:01.840
- Or is unfaithful.
 Nowadays it is used a little more sloppy in daily speech -

46
00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:06.600
-And then means "horny goat" fixed for women.

47
00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:12.640
You don't want to be an Astaghfirullah.
 Marriage is sacred.
 I know that.

48
00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:21.400
Yes ... a horny woman, then.
 But I ... trust you ... I think.

49
00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:27.680
You trust Meira.
 You think it's a term for ... Horny Gäris.

50
00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:34.280
Unfortunately, Elin, there will be no points.

51
00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:45.000
Meira lied to you.
 Astaghfirullah means "I seek God's forgiveness".

52
00:04:45.160 --> 00:04:49.640
It can also be used when someone is in a program -

53
00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:54.000
- Where they are going to marry themselves ...

54
00:04:54.160 --> 00:04:59.600
... without the parents having to choose ... then we say "Astaghfirullah".

55
00:05:05.120 --> 00:05:08.040
- Anders?
 -Thanos.

56
00:05:08.200 --> 00:05:10.160
Thanos ...

57
00:05:13.640 --> 00:05:16.560
Fuck his mom.

58
00:05:24.280 --> 00:05:29.680
When someone says about Rasmus Paludan, we say Muslims "Alhamdulillah".

59
00:05:32.400 --> 00:05:39.040
He is Danish, huh?
 He used to sing i'm poor farmer -

60
00:05:39.200 --> 00:05:44.280
- From Emil in Lönneberga, in Danish: Jeg your poor peasant region ...

61
00:05:46.160 --> 00:05:50.080
While he burns the Qur'an.

62
00:05:50.240 --> 00:05:56.240
- Not a fucking chance.
 - You lied!
 - You think he is lying.

63
00:05:56.400 --> 00:06:00.880
You don't think Rasmus is an Astrid Lindgren fan.

64
00:06:01.040 --> 00:06:05.640
- You don't think Rasmus can read.
 - Can Thanos read?

65
00:06:07.760 --> 00:06:11.320
-Oh oh oh!
 -What happens?

66
00:06:11.480 --> 00:06:16.840
You think Thanos is lying to you.
 You are absolutely sure of that decision?

67
00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:19.720
Sorry, no point for you.

68
00:06:19.880 --> 00:06:22.160
Yes...

69
00:06:22.320 --> 00:06:27.840
He used to sing Alfred's song - I'm a poor peasant boy -

70
00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:30.960
- From Emil in Lönneberga.

71
00:06:36.480 --> 00:06:41.360
It is extremely important to collect points this season -

72
00:06:41.520 --> 00:06:45.240
- To get to the final.

73
00:06:45.400 --> 00:06:49.880
There you have a chance to win the IFS buck.

74
00:06:54.280 --> 00:06:58.400
- Jonas.
 –Yes.
 I drive the beautiful - Elaf.

75
00:06:58.560 --> 00:07:00.760
Thanks!

76
00:07:00.920 --> 00:07:03.480
Oh!

77
00:07:05.640 --> 00:07:09.720
It was worth 6.5 hours in makeup?

78
00:07:09.880 --> 00:07:14.600
Love is really blind, Jonas.
 Really Blind.

79
00:07:17.320 --> 00:07:21.480
-Ot really ... - so.
 Elaf ... –yes.

80
00:07:26.760 --> 00:07:31.920
- It is a swearing ... - Heams Skånskan: a "sviurdium"?

81
00:07:33.240 --> 00:07:39.040
That's why Jonas wants you.
 He has wanted to become a Swedish teacher.
 Continue!

82
00:07:39.200 --> 00:07:44.920
It is a swearing that Arab mothers use when they are angry with their children.

83
00:07:45.080 --> 00:07:49.960
So you have heard it ... but instead of swearing your children -

84
00:07:50.120 --> 00:07:55.640
- Smär they on her husband.
 Maybe because they get married to him ...

85
00:07:55.800 --> 00:07:58.960
It means "curse over your dad".

86
00:07:59.120 --> 00:08:03.520
Should I say it once with feeling?
 Yilan Abouk!

87
00:08:08.080 --> 00:08:13.480
- I say it's ... true.
 - You choose to trust your dearest?

88
00:08:13.640 --> 00:08:18.480
Shouldn't you do it, right?
 You do that right in that.

89
00:08:18.640 --> 00:08:22.600
You just got one more point.
 Congratulations.

90
00:08:24.200 --> 00:08:29.560
As Elaf said, it is mostly used by mothers who swear over your dad.

91
00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:35.920
There is nothing you heard at work when you have stopped any Arab?

92
00:08:36.080 --> 00:08:41.320
- What is the typical swearing you hear?
 -It's in Swedish.

93
00:08:41.480 --> 00:08:46.600
-Type ... "Pip-kid".
 - You have heard 100 percent!

94
00:08:46.760 --> 00:08:50.560
- Very Polish too.
 - "Kurwa!"

95
00:08:50.720 --> 00:08:53.200
Congratulations.

96
00:08:53.360 --> 00:08:55.040
- ELIN!
 –Yes.

97
00:08:55.200 --> 00:09:00.320
Second chance ... Now you think you should choose a panelist.

98
00:09:00.480 --> 00:09:04.880
But you have received a letter.
 A letter from Botkyrka.

99
00:09:13.080 --> 00:09:16.640
Hello, good people!
 I have to be a little quiet.

100
00:09:16.800 --> 00:09:21.040
I stand here at the Alby Library in the heart of Northern Botkyrka

101
00:09:21.200 --> 00:09:26.840
At this library, the Swedish law book is the most loaned book.

102
00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:30.200
The question is: is that true?

103
00:09:34.160 --> 00:09:38.560
-No I do not think so.
 - You don't believe people in Botkyrka read?

104
00:09:38.720 --> 00:09:41.680
And don't follow laws ...

105
00:09:42.840 --> 00:09:45.520
Come on, Elin!

106
00:09:46.920 --> 00:09:50.920
- I say "fake".
 - You don't believe Dogge.

107
00:09:51.080 --> 00:09:53.960
No, he is lying.

108
00:09:54.120 --> 00:09:58.520
- You do it right. Congratulations.
 - Fan, what a good thing!

109
00:09:59.520 --> 00:10:04.680
The law book is not the most loaned book there.
 It's Alfons Åberg.

110
00:10:06.160 --> 00:10:10.840
- Anders.
 - Hassan felt outside before.

111
00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:13.200
- Hassan.
 - Good there!

112
00:10:13.360 --> 00:10:18.960
- What is Abu Hassan?
 - Araba Araba is a nickname on him.

113
00:10:19.120 --> 00:10:24.240
He is a very well -known driving school teacher, traffic teacher or whatever it is called.

114
00:10:24.400 --> 00:10:27.280
He has seven binders.

115
00:10:27.440 --> 00:10:32.080
And with those binders you can handle the driver's license without any problems.

116
00:10:34.440 --> 00:10:39.120
–Okay ... - it's a legend.
 But also real.

117
00:10:39.280 --> 00:10:44.880
Yes, not where I come from.
 There he is not a legend.

118
00:10:45.040 --> 00:10:49.760
- Have you not heard of the binders?
 - Not many Hassan in Borlänge?

119
00:10:49.920 --> 00:10:54.600
-Yes it is.
 But not him.
 -Not you.

120
00:10:54.760 --> 00:10:57.880
-What do you think?
 -Lie.

121
00:10:58.040 --> 00:11:03.240
Not a driving school teacher who was extra ambitious with their students?

122
00:11:03.400 --> 00:11:06.960
You do that right in. Congratulations!

123
00:11:09.600 --> 00:11:16.600
Abu Hassan was a character created by comedian and rapper Big Fred–

124
00:11:16.760 --> 00:11:20.440
-As you could see with little al-Fadji.

125
00:11:20.600 --> 00:11:25.440
We lost Big Fred earlier this year.
 Rest in peace.

126
00:11:25.600 --> 00:11:31.440
It was a beloved character that gave us words like Kahwa and subsidiary.

127
00:11:34.920 --> 00:11:38.640
- Jonas?
 –Yes ... I drive ... Evelyn.

128
00:11:42.640 --> 00:11:48.520
-Hello Jonas.
 Do you want to arrest me?
 - We will take it after that.

129
00:11:51.920 --> 00:11:56.520
When I say EuroTrem, what do you think?

130
00:11:56.680 --> 00:12:01.840
EuroTrem ... it's actually such a Eurotechnoband -

131
00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:05.720
– Which is ... they are quite sexual -

132
00:12:05.880 --> 00:12:10.840
- In their music style and clothing and type texts and such.

133
00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:16.760
It is a bit controversial because it consists of a father and a son-

134
00:12:16.920 --> 00:12:21.240
- But it's not that surprising, because they are from Belgium.

135
00:12:21.400 --> 00:12:24.880
- What was it called?
 –Eurocrem.

136
00:12:25.040 --> 00:12:27.920
- Cream?
 - Cream!

137
00:12:28.080 --> 00:12:32.560
-Cream!
 - Cream in English?
 I get it.

138
00:12:32.720 --> 00:12:38.920
I say falsely on it.
 I have said true at two, so now I run a false one.

139
00:12:39.720 --> 00:12:44.760
If you get a point now you have "Aceat" this round.

140
00:12:44.920 --> 00:12:48.480
It has.
 Congratulations, Jonas!

141
00:12:50.400 --> 00:12:56.520
EuroTrem is definitely not an incestuous dance group from Belgium -

142
00:12:56.680 --> 00:13:01.480
- Without Yugoslav Nutella.
 - Congratulations on the point!

143
00:13:01.640 --> 00:13:05.560
- What do you choose?
 - My brother Filip.

144
00:13:05.720 --> 00:13:09.360
PAM-PAM-PAM!
 - Hit me.

145
00:13:10.120 --> 00:13:16.400
Filip ... if you are invited home to an Eastern European on a little mama ...

146
00:13:16.560 --> 00:13:20.880
- What will you get then?
 –Eurocrem.

147
00:13:23.160 --> 00:13:25.400
Like this...

148
00:13:25.560 --> 00:13:28.640
Eastern Europeans are a bit weird -

149
00:13:28.800 --> 00:13:33.240
- So they have a several centuries old tradition -

150
00:13:33.400 --> 00:13:38.440
- To test the man.
 The mother -in -law should see if the man is approved.

151
00:13:38.600 --> 00:13:44.600
So the tests are kind of chopping firewood, sip them down ... but also weird stuff -

152
00:13:44.760 --> 00:13:51.160
- As the man half naked in underwear should carry the mother -in -law around the house.

153
00:13:51.320 --> 00:13:57.360
It sounds like something they do over there.
 So, it's tests for them to ...

154
00:13:57.520 --> 00:14:01.320
- The warm -ups test the man.
 - Mama.

155
00:14:02.280 --> 00:14:07.600
I have no idea.
 But I say ... true on it, I think.

156
00:14:07.760 --> 00:14:11.040
-Are you married?
 - Yeah ... no.

157
00:14:12.280 --> 00:14:15.680
She began to hesitate!

158
00:14:15.840 --> 00:14:19.400
"It depends on what Filip is going to do."

159
00:14:19.560 --> 00:14:23.280
-Not married.
 - But you believe in Filip?

160
00:14:24.240 --> 00:14:27.120
- Yes ... — Lite on him!

161
00:14:27.280 --> 00:14:31.480
- You shouldn't have trusted him!
 - Fan, Filip!

162
00:14:37.600 --> 00:14:39.560
Damn...

163
00:14:39.720 --> 00:14:45.680
It is not a wedding tradition for someone to be tested by mother -in -law.

164
00:14:45.840 --> 00:14:51.400
Momy is an Eastern European dish made on corn porridge.

165
00:14:51.560 --> 00:14:56.320
It's porridge.
 - Anders, you should get your last question.

166
00:14:56.480 --> 00:15:01.040
You have a point.
 Elin has a point.
 So the question is important.

167
00:15:01.200 --> 00:15:05.440
If you take it, go on to the next round.

168
00:15:05.600 --> 00:15:09.680
--Cisalli.
 - It's time for a video question.

169
00:15:14.120 --> 00:15:16.960
What was it we saw?

170
00:15:17.120 --> 00:15:20.760
It is called in my country Indian abortion.

171
00:15:22.240 --> 00:15:26.880
- Namely too late ... - when you know they don't become a doctor!

172
00:15:28.480 --> 00:15:35.080
It is an Indian tradition to throw a baby from 15 meters height-

173
00:15:35.240 --> 00:15:40.640
- To thank God for listening to one's prayers.

174
00:15:40.800 --> 00:15:45.360
- It should give the child lucky.
 - What do you say, Anders?

175
00:15:45.520 --> 00:15:50.840
Anders looked at me: "They threw out a child through a window ...!"

176
00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:53.880
It's false.

177
00:15:54.040 --> 00:15:59.280
You don't think they throw out the kids to give the kids lucky?

178
00:15:59.440 --> 00:16:03.080
Unfortunately.
 It was true, Anders.

179
00:16:04.200 --> 00:16:08.160
It is a controversial Indian tradition.

180
00:16:08.320 --> 00:16:14.400
One throws children down from a temple to be captured into a large white canvas -

181
00:16:14.560 --> 00:16:21.040
- To have a long life and happiness.
 Anders, no point for you.

182
00:16:21.200 --> 00:16:25.800
Great for you, Elin.
 You both have one point each.

183
00:16:25.960 --> 00:16:30.400
Only one of you goes on.
 Time for a rash issue.

184
00:16:33.840 --> 00:16:39.640
And it goes so that we run what we call "closest to win".

185
00:16:39.800 --> 00:16:43.320
How many in Sweden is called Mohamed?

186
00:16:43.480 --> 00:16:48.760
It is calculated if the name is spelled with one m, two sts, U or O.

187
00:16:48.920 --> 00:16:53.880
Do you have your answers ready?
 Do you know someone named Mohamed?

188
00:16:54.040 --> 00:16:57.960
–Yes.
 -Yes, you work at HVB homes ...

189
00:17:01.160 --> 00:17:02.960
Okay...

190
00:17:03.120 --> 00:17:06.360
- The top.
 –100,000.

191
00:17:06.520 --> 00:17:10.600
-Oh!
 Wow ... - Snip ...!
 Come on now.

192
00:17:10.760 --> 00:17:14.840
The answer to how many muhamed there is in Sweden -

193
00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:18.760
- Is 50,874.

194
00:17:18.920 --> 00:17:24.520
Anders got a point and has moved on to the next round.

195
00:17:24.680 --> 00:17:30.600
Elin, thank you for joining.
 - Now it's time for the duel.

196
00:17:36.800 --> 00:17:43.160
In the duel you will not be able to choose, but I choose panelists for you.

197
00:17:43.320 --> 00:17:47.000
You get two panelists on each question.

198
00:17:47.160 --> 00:17:51.720
One panelist answers correctly.
 The other is lying to you.

199
00:17:51.880 --> 00:17:56.120
Find the true answer.
 - Jonas, we start with you.

200
00:17:56.280 --> 00:17:59.840
Your panelists will be Elaf and Hassan.

201
00:18:04.280 --> 00:18:10.120
And the question is: When should Muslims be silent, according to Islam?

202
00:18:10.280 --> 00:18:12.760
At the airport.

203
00:18:12.920 --> 00:18:16.440
Especially on ... aircraft.

204
00:18:18.880 --> 00:18:21.000
No no no.

205
00:18:21.160 --> 00:18:25.680
Muslims should be silent when in the toilet.

206
00:18:26.720 --> 00:18:32.960
And especially when doing number two.
 So if I am e.g.
 on the toilet and poop -

207
00:18:33.120 --> 00:18:37.040
–And Big o is with me too ...

208
00:18:37.200 --> 00:18:41.160
- It's a big toilet!
 - Big o films!

209
00:18:41.320 --> 00:18:45.560
We must not talk to each other.
 We can write.

210
00:18:45.720 --> 00:18:49.960
- Snapchat, insta, you know ... —Tinder.

211
00:18:50.120 --> 00:18:53.160
Also.
 Grindr.
 All!

212
00:18:54.240 --> 00:18:58.440
A non-Muslim is allowed to talk.
 I can answer by phone.

213
00:18:58.600 --> 00:19:03.080
So if you are a Muslim and the toilet paper ends -

214
00:19:03.240 --> 00:19:06.400
- Can't you ask for help from outside?

215
00:19:06.560 --> 00:19:11.480
- A Muslim has the water can ready.
 - Otherwise, there we have it!

216
00:19:13.320 --> 00:19:18.680
Or the shower hose.
 When you are an advanced Muslim you have a shower hose.

217
00:19:18.840 --> 00:19:24.240
Sometimes you get a shock when the shower beam is a little too strong.

218
00:19:24.400 --> 00:19:27.960
Thanks, Hassan.
 - Elaf?

219
00:19:28.120 --> 00:19:33.200
The true answer that according to a more strict Islam-

220
00:19:33.360 --> 00:19:39.200
- Man and woman do not make sounds during the mating act itself.

221
00:19:39.800 --> 00:19:45.520
- My gut feeling says Elaf is lying.
 - What does your heart say?

222
00:19:45.680 --> 00:19:49.960
I believe in you.
 The heart says Hassan.

223
00:19:50.640 --> 00:19:56.360
-Love is blind and love is silent ... - He doesn't want it to be true.

224
00:19:56.520 --> 00:19:58.360
But it's true.

225
00:19:58.520 --> 00:20:02.040
"The heart says Hassan" is Jonas autobiography.

226
00:20:02.200 --> 00:20:07.240
Jonas, you chose to trust Hassan.
 You chose to throw your dearest.

227
00:20:07.400 --> 00:20:10.240
You did it right.

228
00:20:10.400 --> 00:20:15.320
- Fucking brother!
 Me and you ... - you can't say brother to Shurta.

229
00:20:15.480 --> 00:20:21.120
- He has eyes on me now.
 - But he is shurta, brother.

230
00:20:21.280 --> 00:20:27.920
In Islam, you should not talk in the toilet.
 Do your thing and go away.

231
00:20:28.080 --> 00:20:31.560
Silence when you look at porn magazines.

232
00:20:31.720 --> 00:20:36.240
What is the matter with you and porn?
 Every season - porn!

233
00:20:36.400 --> 00:20:41.200
You should be quiet when this arrives.

234
00:20:47.520 --> 00:20:50.560
Congratulations, Jonas!
 - Anders ...

235
00:20:50.720 --> 00:20:56.440
The two panelists you should talk to are no less than Meira and Cisalli.

236
00:20:59.320 --> 00:21:04.480
What is the Russian equivalent of the term "love is blind"?

237
00:21:04.640 --> 00:21:07.880
Love is blind, love is blind ...

238
00:21:08.040 --> 00:21:13.600
"Ljubov 'Zla - Poljubish in Kozla" as it is called in Russian.

239
00:21:13.760 --> 00:21:20.440
Literally: "Love is evil - because you might fall in love with a goat."

240
00:21:22.040 --> 00:21:25.840
Can you say that again in Russian?

241
00:21:26.000 --> 00:21:30.640
"Ljubov 'Zla - Poljubish in Kozla."

242
00:21:32.080 --> 00:21:37.680
The real answer is really ... The equivalent of Russian is -

243
00:21:37.840 --> 00:21:43.320
- God has opened your heart but at the same time cut your eyes.

244
00:21:43.480 --> 00:21:49.920
"Love makes you crazy, stupid in your head."
 I can say that in Russian:

245
00:21:50.080 --> 00:21:53.640
"Ojski Boyki Nazorovje" ...

246
00:21:53.800 --> 00:21:57.040
But, wait ... Cisalli!

247
00:21:57.200 --> 00:22:02.240
- I am Russian too!
 - "Ojski Pojski Kurwa" ....

248
00:22:02.400 --> 00:22:09.120
- Who do you choose to believe in?
 –Meira.
 It sounds most likely.

249
00:22:09.280 --> 00:22:14.800
It sounds most likely that love can make you fall in love with a goat?

250
00:22:14.960 --> 00:22:19.880
It sounds more like a Kurdish expression if I am to be honest.

251
00:22:21.760 --> 00:22:27.440
It is not such a program.
 You think Meira gave you the true answer.

252
00:22:27.600 --> 00:22:32.280
That love is evil because you can fall in love with a goat.

253
00:22:32.440 --> 00:22:36.160
That's right.
 Congratulations.
 A point.

254
00:22:39.160 --> 00:22:43.040
Nothing is more poetic than Russian love.

255
00:22:43.200 --> 00:22:46.920
Meira was really looking for a goat.

256
00:22:47.880 --> 00:22:52.920
Jonas, we move on to you.
 You should talk to big o ...

257
00:22:53.080 --> 00:22:56.560
--... and Evelyn.
 -Abow, Aina again, yao!

258
00:22:56.720 --> 00:23:00.080
Shabab, Jalla!

259
00:23:00.240 --> 00:23:05.480
- What is Treif?
 - There are three guys.
 Everyone is called Leif.

260
00:23:09.720 --> 00:23:13.920
Nämen ... Treif is the place for a soap.

261
00:23:15.600 --> 00:23:21.520
From the beginning it is a Persian word for the Kläftans claw - "Amina Cevdet".

262
00:23:21.680 --> 00:23:27.160
Now you use it to describe people who you think are stingy.

263
00:23:27.320 --> 00:23:30.360
Maddafakkers!

264
00:23:39.800 --> 00:23:44.480
What do you say, Evelyn?
 - Treif, it's ...

265
00:23:44.640 --> 00:23:49.200
It is the Jewish equivalent of Haram.

266
00:23:49.360 --> 00:23:54.400
So if a Jew says that something is Treif, then it's not Kosher.

267
00:23:54.560 --> 00:23:58.920
It's not okay, like.
 It's haram.

268
00:23:59.080 --> 00:24:03.720
- Filip has been Treif lately.
 - She is happy to lie.

269
00:24:03.880 --> 00:24:09.400
- Kosher is okay.
 Treif is bad.
 -You Are Treif, Mother.

270
00:24:09.560 --> 00:24:14.760
This is ... Treif.
 I should have heard it in the resort.

271
00:24:14.920 --> 00:24:21.360
Jonas is currently going through encrocats in his head.
 Just scroll through.

272
00:24:21.520 --> 00:24:25.240
Evelyn.
 You believe in Evelyn?

273
00:24:25.400 --> 00:24:31.240
That Treif is a Jewish equivalent of Haram, which is not kosher.

274
00:24:32.840 --> 00:24:38.000
Very kosher of you.
 Congratulations, Jonas, you got another one.

275
00:24:38.160 --> 00:24:41.680
Treif is what is not allowed.

276
00:24:41.840 --> 00:24:45.920
It is mainly used if what one is not allowed to eat.

277
00:24:46.080 --> 00:24:52.680
Anders, you know it says 2-1.
 And this is the last duel.

278
00:24:52.840 --> 00:24:56.680
I see who I got.
 Yay.

279
00:25:02.040 --> 00:25:04.640
Switch!

280
00:25:04.800 --> 00:25:10.000
I have never seen any dissertation people so naturally in slow motion.

281
00:25:10.160 --> 00:25:15.880
Your duel is between Thanos and Filip and the question you get ...

282
00:25:18.440 --> 00:25:23.240
In 2016, Zlatan Ibrahimovic said he was going to leave PSG.

283
00:25:23.400 --> 00:25:25.920
He could stay on a condition.
 What was that?

284
00:25:26.080 --> 00:25:31.560
Replace the Eiffel Tower with a statue of him.

285
00:25:31.720 --> 00:25:36.520
It sounds like Zlatan, but I have another answer.

286
00:25:37.520 --> 00:25:40.960
Are you ready?

287
00:25:41.120 --> 00:25:44.680
Anders ... that was another condition.

288
00:25:44.840 --> 00:25:51.080
He wanted his teammates to refer to him as The Lion.

289
00:25:51.240 --> 00:25:57.200
- I can give you the whole back story.
 - Do you lit on one with law education?

290
00:25:57.360 --> 00:26:01.520
- He is trained to lie!
 -Oh...

291
00:26:03.560 --> 00:26:09.320
Society's dirt that capitalizes on people who end up at HVB homes.

292
00:26:09.480 --> 00:26:12.800
Should you trust one like that?

293
00:26:12.960 --> 00:26:18.080
They want it to go to hell!
 Then they can get more money from the state.

294
00:26:18.240 --> 00:26:23.720
Do we want such as Filip Dikmen in Public Service?
 We will ask that!

295
00:26:23.880 --> 00:26:29.840
Do you know what is true or false?
 Vote for Thanos is photographed in the next election!

296
00:26:34.280 --> 00:26:40.160
- This is the new Sweden!
 - Anders, calm down the black shells now.

297
00:26:41.600 --> 00:26:45.920
- You can invoice afterwards.
 -I get Abiats-Nuva from this.

298
00:26:46.080 --> 00:26:51.200
- What do you trust?
 Thanos or Filip?
 - It Filip says ...

299
00:26:51.360 --> 00:26:55.960
I imagine Zlatan said so.
 But I believe in Thanos.

300
00:26:56.120 --> 00:27:01.560
- This will bite me back there.
 - Why do you trust him?!

301
00:27:02.560 --> 00:27:06.120
!
 Anders, I cheer for you!

302
00:27:06.280 --> 00:27:12.320
You put your cards on Thanos.
 If you get points, it will be a matter of rash.

303
00:27:12.480 --> 00:27:16.400
If you do not get points, it ends here.

304
00:27:16.560 --> 00:27:21.680
I appreciate your zen-lug.
 Because you get no points tonight.

305
00:27:23.320 --> 00:27:25.320
Unfortunately.

306
00:27:25.480 --> 00:27:30.400
The true answer came from Filip and the Eiffel Tower.

307
00:27:31.880 --> 00:27:35.720
Zlatan wanted to replace the Eiffel Tower.

308
00:27:35.880 --> 00:27:39.840
It went so well the last time he got a statue ...

309
00:27:40.000 --> 00:27:45.880
With that said: Thanks so much, Anders!
 - Congratulations, Jonas, tonight's winner!

310
00:27:49.440 --> 00:27:53.760
Of course you should get a jar with EuroTrem!

311
00:27:54.720 --> 00:28:01.280
A large applause for our winner, our panel, the competitors and our audience.

312
00:28:01.440 --> 00:28:07.320
See you in the semi -finals.
 - And see you next week.
 Feel the best!

313
00:28:29.720 --> 00:28:31.720
