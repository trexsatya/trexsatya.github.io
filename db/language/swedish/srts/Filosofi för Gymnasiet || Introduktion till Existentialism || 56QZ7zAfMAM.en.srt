00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:14,780
Hello philosophers, and welcome to this moment of existentialism.

2
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:21,640
Existentialism, or philosophy of existence, is a philosophical movement born during the 19th century

3
00:00:21,640 --> 00:00:26,420
With thinkers like Søren Kierkegaard, Friedrich Nietzsche and Fjodor Dostoevsky.

4
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:31,420
But it was only after World War II that existentialism got its real breakthrough

5
00:00:31,420 --> 00:00:35,700
With Jean-Paul Sartre and writer like Franz Kafka and Albert Camus.

6
00:00:36,300 --> 00:00:39,400
What is it that links these philosophers and writers?

7
00:00:39,620 --> 00:00:44,280
Well, they all tried to describe the human existence and questions such as:

8
00:00:44,440 --> 00:00:46,440
"What does it mean to be human?"

9
00:00:46,780 --> 00:00:48,540
"What is the meaning of life?"

10
00:00:48,760 --> 00:00:50,460
"How should I live my life?"

11
00:00:51,220 --> 00:00:54,520
Different existentialists have had different answers to these questions,

12
00:00:54,520 --> 00:00:58,580
But they share the view that the answer is subjective rather than objectively.

13
00:00:59,340 --> 00:01:06,420
An existentialist therefore usually takes away from all all -inclusive theories (ie theories that apply to all)

14
00:01:06,420 --> 00:01:12,960
who try to explain the meaning of life, whether they are religious, scientific or philosophical.

15
00:01:13,660 --> 00:01:17,520
Existentialism is thus a relativistic philosophy.

16
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:23,420
It is easy to see the attraction in religions that claim to have the answers to the existential questions.

17
00:01:23,760 --> 00:01:27,480
As many as 84 percent of the earth's population are also believers

18
00:01:27,760 --> 00:01:33,040
(In Sweden, which is the world's most secularized country, the corresponding figure is 35 percent).

19
00:01:33,860 --> 00:01:40,500
To ponder the meaning of life without the support of religious or philosophical theory is undoubtedly difficult,

20
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:43,360
But that is what existentialists mean we have to do.

21
00:01:43,700 --> 00:01:48,660
Many existentialists even mean that religion is harmful to individual development

22
00:01:48,660 --> 00:01:53,360
to a free and authentic person who takes responsibility for his or her actions.

23
00:01:53,780 --> 00:01:58,320
The problem with these all -inclusive theories is that they do not take adequate consideration

24
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:00,640
To what it means to be human.

25
00:02:00,860 --> 00:02:06,420
They assume that meaning and purpose originates from an alternative and objective sphere

26
00:02:06,420 --> 00:02:09,100
such as heaven or Plato's world of ideas.

27
00:02:09,660 --> 00:02:13,880
Many of the traditional religions also answer the philosophical questions

28
00:02:13,880 --> 00:02:19,700
From the perspective of an omniscient God, forwarded to us through prophets.

29
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:26,380
An existentialist believes that what we need is not a divine perspective, but a human such.

30
00:02:26,620 --> 00:02:31,600
Or as Nietzsche put it, after all, we are "human, too human".

31
00:02:31,980 --> 00:02:36,820
Another problem with the divine perspective is that it misses a fundamental aspect

32
00:02:36,820 --> 00:02:39,940
of human existence - our mortality.

33
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:46,000
Most religions deny life's perishability through the belief in some form of aftermath.

34
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:49,260
Existentialists have pointed to the insight about our death

35
00:02:49,260 --> 00:02:53,340
As a way to stop following others and create one's own meaning with life.

36
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:59,800
The idea that the meaning of life is individual is closely related to another existentialist idea

37
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:03,900
- That for man comes the existence before the essence.

38
00:03:04,220 --> 00:03:10,620
To understand this central statement about human life, we must first understand the term "essence".

39
00:03:11,020 --> 00:03:14,740
The term was coined by the Greek philosopher Aristotle.

40
00:03:15,060 --> 00:03:20,960
He felt that every subject or thing has an essence - something sometimes called its nature.

41
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:27,380
These are properties or characteristics that are necessary for the thing to be what it is.

42
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:33,720
Aristotle said that human essence was reason - we are the sensible animal.

43
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:38,020
But unlike other animals, man also has the opportunity to choose

44
00:03:38,020 --> 00:03:41,140
Whether she wants to act accordingly or not.

45
00:03:41,700 --> 00:03:46,840
However, he did not think that the individual could affect his essence as this was innate.

46
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:52,840
Neither for those who believe that God has designed and created the world is the essence something impactable.

47
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:59,880
The essence of the individual is something in advance of God, which is why the essence precedes existence.

48
00:04:00,020 --> 00:04:03,240
The same can be said of many science theories.

49
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:10,160
One claims that the meaning of life can be traced to biology, or that a person's actions are a consequence

50
00:04:10,160 --> 00:04:16,400
From the individual's genetic heritage, it is also believed that the essence precedes existence.

51
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:22,520
According to the foreground figure of existentialism, Jean-Paul Sartre, human existence is unique.

52
00:04:22,640 --> 00:04:27,740
We are not, like the thing that surrounds us, created with a predetermined purpose.

53
00:04:28,020 --> 00:04:30,580
A clock's essence is to show time.

54
00:04:30,580 --> 00:04:36,580
It is thus created for a specific purpose, which is why its essence precedes its existence.

55
00:04:36,920 --> 00:04:41,300
Man, on the other hand, is born without purpose and our ability to free choices

56
00:04:41,300 --> 00:04:44,120
Gives us the opportunity to create our essence through life.

57
00:04:44,380 --> 00:04:49,900
There is no pre -given human nature or any objective purpose with our existence,

58
00:04:49,900 --> 00:04:53,220
Without it, it is up to everyone to create meaning themselves with their lives.

59
00:04:53,540 --> 00:04:56,760
For man, existence comes before the essence.

60
00:04:57,060 --> 00:05:01,220
Sartre, who was atheist, meant that since there is no god

61
00:05:01,220 --> 00:05:06,640
So there are no predetermined values either - no fact for right and wrong or good and evil.

62
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:11,200
He even went so far that he claimed that man is "doomed to freedom",

63
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:17,160
That is, we not only can but actually have to take a stand and create our lives ourselves.

64
00:05:17,640 --> 00:05:22,000
In this chapter we will take a closer look at Søren Kierkegaard, Friedrich Nietzsche,

65
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:25,020
Jean-Paul Sartre and Simone de Beauvoir.
