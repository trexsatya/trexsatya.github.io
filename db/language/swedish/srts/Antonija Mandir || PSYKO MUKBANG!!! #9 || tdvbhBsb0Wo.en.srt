1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.900
Good morning

2
00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:04.560
Welcome back to the talk show

3
00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:06.740
To the Psycho Mukbang talk show.

4
00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:08.580
It is a talk show we should have maybe

5
00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:10.280
I saw that it was blinking in your head right away.

6
00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:13.400
Ding, ding, and then drrrrr.

7
00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:15.740
Should you have a Redbull for breakfast

8
00:00:16.120 --> 00:00:17.520
Fuck what disgusting.

9
00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:19.260
I never drink Redbull but today I am tired.

10
00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:22.120
It was you who asked me to buy fruit.

11
00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:24.720
But can you remove that in the middle first how do you cut?

12
00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:26.960
You may well remove when you eat human

13
00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:29.080
This is removed by spoon first

14
00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:33.340
Not on my plate.
 Where should I put it then?

15
00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:34.120
Armin ..

16
00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:37.680
Babe stands on mine,

17
00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:38.920
Babe

18
00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:40.900
On my then, you totally rules.

19
00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:41.820
What does it mean

20
00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:45.200
Babe, that means "you own".

21
00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:47.360
Can't you English

22
00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:49.480
I thought Rule was the Rule Model.

23
00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:51.860
Rude I thought otherwise it was.

24
00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:55.680
Pretty good, I also have a large vocabulary

25
00:00:58.720 --> 00:01:00.720
Swedish is actually not my strong side either.

26
00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:03.480
Something that is actually my strong side, you know what it is

27
00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:06.560
It's not to shut up and let me talk in a Mukbang once.

28
00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:07.220
Right.

29
00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:08.160
Just

30
00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:11.480
No now you should look boring it is when I shut up.

31
00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:14.240
What am I a sack of potatoes or?

32
00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:16.640
I love potatoes though.

33
00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:22.180
Klara talked so much in the last Mukbangen and many asked why I was so quiet.

34
00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:25.500
You have to learn to let other people talk so

35
00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:28.220
*Interrupts each other*

36
00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:30.860
I'll keep quiet huh. - Yes.

37
00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:34.200
You ask a question, you answer it yourself .. you are type ..:

38
00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:38.040
Do you know what I have ... and tells yourself to yourself.
 You have a mukbang with yourself.

39
00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:41.740
It might just be better that I have them myself.

40
00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:44.600
Or you get out of here.

41
00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:46.480
And I have them myself.

42
00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:49.000
Should you have bread or - yes.

43
00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:50.380
Yeah

44
00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:52.220
Quiet I said

45
00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:55.640
What have you done last time

46
00:01:55.840 --> 00:02:00.400
Antonija has been angry .. What the hell does Lapplisa where they patch them my car then I will f*cking kill you.

47
00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:03.980
You see them orients

48
00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:07.260
Yeah..what is not school end

49
00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:08.800
I haven't put parking on my car.

50
00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:09.780
Haven't you done that

51
00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:11.080
No .. Armin

52
00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:14.300
What have you had .. should we hug or should we bowl

53
00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:19.500
Wait, wait, hug .. I felt a bit like a thunderstorm when I came in here.

54
00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:21.820
Why does this apple juice taste

55
00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:23.280
What have you done

56
00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:25.040
Now she starts again.

57
00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:28.300
Yes anyway.
 It's just you and you.

58
00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:32.100
This I think we should taste.
 Choco Blanco.

59
00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:34.700
I asked what you have done lately

60
00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:36.260
So .. now ..

61
00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:40.800
We can talk .. The weather is something we can talk about.

62
00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:43.180
Hug.

63
00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:44.480
I like you.

64
00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:47.180
I liked you too.

65
00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:50.500
Can we talk about this being the last mukban we do when I'm 29.

66
00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:52.800
Yeah, when are you turning years tomorrow?

67
00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:54.640
I am celebrating years on June 11.

68
00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:57.160
No it's not tomorrow

69
00:02:57.160 --> 00:02:58.480
No it is the day after tomorrow.

70
00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:00.920
So that you are not aware ..

71
00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:04.560
She says who didn't even invite me to her 30th year party.

72
00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:07.180
What are we still there?

73
00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:09.820
I'm hurt

74
00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:12.460
You were damn in fourth place

75
00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:15.520
*ruffles*

76
00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:19.920
Can you stop cutting it on .. wait a stop.

77
00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:23.100
Now I have no plate.
 This would be the slash plate.

78
00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:25.400
You have taken the slash plate on my ...

79
00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:26.500
Now you have spilled on my trousers too.

80
00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:28.000
I am actually celebrating years.

81
00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:29.560
Yeah

82
00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:30.520
In two days.

83
00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:32.920
How does it feel like you turn 29

84
00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:36.640
Can we talk about that my plate is now wet - Häääär, Häääär, Hääär !!!

85
00:03:38.740 --> 00:03:40.740
But stop I'm not done

86
00:03:40.740 --> 00:03:42.680
Then it becomes it ..

87
00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:49.300
How are you darling

88
00:03:49.300 --> 00:03:53.560
Thanks for the question, it only took 15 minutes into the intro until you asked.

89
00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:57.560
Them will get a wrong picture of me, am not i nice

90
00:03:57.880 --> 00:03:59.880
I think the right picture.

91
00:03:59.880 --> 00:04:01.820
Hello is not me a nice girl

92
00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:06.140
Can't we take our college level to a new level?

93
00:04:06.240 --> 00:04:08.240
Yes but then you can actually let me talk.

94
00:04:08.320 --> 00:04:10.880
Hello how does it feel to fill 29 quite seriously now.

95
00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:12.400
However, I turn 30.

96
00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:13.760
You said 29.

97
00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:15.840
This is the last time I am 29 I said.

98
00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:17.020
I mean 30 you take well.

99
00:04:17.020 --> 00:04:17.780
Oh my God

100
00:04:18.040 --> 00:04:19.840
I leave the 29yr decade.

101
00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:21.280
I realized that now.

102
00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:22.700
Or 20 years of decade.

103
00:04:22.700 --> 00:04:23.640
It feels crap.

104
00:04:23.640 --> 00:04:24.880
Do you feel old

105
00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:25.660
Because that's you.

106
00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:29.820
I know I often hear that I look like 14, Armin said that this morning too.

107
00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:33.720
But ... if this ambulance shuts down ..

108
00:04:33.920 --> 00:04:37.080
It goes to pick up my old life.

109
00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:44.080
If you feel adult than type when you were 15, you felt "when I turn 18 then I become an adult".

110
00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:45.980
Same with 25.

111
00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:48.620
Do you still know the adult or do you just know no

112
00:04:48.620 --> 00:04:50.420
Do you understand what I mean

113
00:04:50.440 --> 00:04:56.520
So I would say this: I understand exactly what you mean.
 When I was 22, I felt that I was type 15.

114
00:04:56.520 --> 00:04:58.500
But now I'm an adult.

115
00:04:58.660 --> 00:05:00.860
I can manage myself, I know how to cook pasta etc.

116
00:05:00.860 --> 00:05:02.720
I mean life.

117
00:05:03.100 --> 00:05:03.620
Well

118
00:05:03.880 --> 00:05:05.680
No I still like to tramples just as much.

119
00:05:06.100 --> 00:05:07.900
So, for example, when I have children ...

120
00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:10.000
I will tramp very much.

121
00:05:10.440 --> 00:05:13.760
I will be the one who just "should you have melon cheated!"

122
00:05:15.420 --> 00:05:17.420
I will be that person.

123
00:05:17.480 --> 00:05:22.220
Still, I never think I will grow up.
 When people ask me how old I am:

124
00:05:22.320 --> 00:05:25.060
And I will have to say thirty so I'll just ... Do you start feeling sensible?

125
00:05:25.060 --> 00:05:26.020
No.

126
00:05:26.120 --> 00:05:29.960
So sensible is something I really do not.

127
00:05:29.960 --> 00:05:31.940
Choco Blanco.

128
00:05:31.940 --> 00:05:32.640
Although I think you are.

129
00:05:32.640 --> 00:05:33.440
Yeah ..

130
00:05:33.440 --> 00:05:35.440
Do you know what's a bit boring with you

131
00:05:35.540 --> 00:05:37.540
Mail is something I actually like.

132
00:05:37.920 --> 00:05:38.680
ME.

133
00:05:38.680 --> 00:05:40.360
You're okay.

134
00:05:40.400 --> 00:05:42.400
You don't understand anything from what I'm saying.

135
00:05:42.780 --> 00:05:45.340
If you like me mail, I like.

136
00:05:47.440 --> 00:05:48.780
No love here.

137
00:05:52.420 --> 00:05:55.540
I will actually write down my bank account here in the description.

138
00:05:55.540 --> 00:05:57.140
"Swisha an optional sum."

139
00:05:57.320 --> 00:06:00.100
Label it with Klara's birthday.

140
00:06:02.380 --> 00:06:05.840
It would have been fun if you swish any sum, my number is on Instagram.

141
00:06:06.920 --> 00:06:08.140
Congratulations then.
 Thanks.

142
00:06:08.440 --> 00:06:12.620
 Now summer is here.
 - Yes, speaking of summer, do you know what I heard on the internet this morning?

143
00:06:19.280 --> 00:06:20.240
"I read on the internet that ..."

144
00:06:21.500 --> 00:06:23.500
No now I have grown old for real.

145
00:06:23.700 --> 00:06:26.440
It wasn't even the internet I would say.

146
00:06:26.520 --> 00:06:28.920
Something I heard on ...

147
00:06:29.400 --> 00:06:31.400
I read the magazine this morning ..

148
00:06:32.200 --> 00:06:34.300
No, this was News Morning.

149
00:06:34.300 --> 00:06:36.000
Do you know what they f*cking is discussing

150
00:06:36.280 --> 00:06:37.680
To shorten the summer holidays.

151
00:06:37.680 --> 00:06:38.700
I've heard about it.

152
00:06:38.700 --> 00:06:39.980
What the hell is that about

153
00:06:39.980 --> 00:06:41.580
I say no

154
00:06:41.580 --> 00:06:43.500
Why do you care you have summer vacation whenever you want.

155
00:06:43.500 --> 00:06:44.800
True ..

156
00:06:45.040 --> 00:06:47.040
You go to Ibiza a little here and there.

157
00:06:47.040 --> 00:06:48.240
It's true.

158
00:06:48.280 --> 00:06:51.340
They said that the summer holidays should not be 10 weeks but it should be type 6.

159
00:06:52.020 --> 00:06:54.020
You are not affected by it.

160
00:06:54.040 --> 00:06:57.180
I felt like this .. If there is something we need more then it is f*cing leave.

161
00:06:57.220 --> 00:06:59.220
More money ..

162
00:06:59.320 --> 00:07:01.320
*mumbles*

163
00:07:01.360 --> 00:07:03.360
As we talked about in the last section.

164
00:07:03.480 --> 00:07:07.760
I just thought it is probably not good to shorten it too much.

165
00:07:08.400 --> 00:07:12.000
I think people feel good about having 8 weeks of vacation and taking it easy.

166
00:07:13.440 --> 00:07:15.440
I think it's important, you understand

167
00:07:15.540 --> 00:07:18.480
I became really upset and sat there ..

168
00:07:18.480 --> 00:07:20.160
It is important for the children

169
00:07:20.160 --> 00:07:22.060
The sandwiches came in the same vein, I was very stressed.

170
00:07:22.060 --> 00:07:23.760
Why are them so blonde, the sandwiches

171
00:07:23.940 --> 00:07:26.980
They are so extremely bright.

172
00:07:26.980 --> 00:07:28.060
There is a lot of pollen here.

173
00:07:28.200 --> 00:07:29.400
Do you feel the pollen

174
00:07:29.540 --> 00:07:31.660
For the first time in my life I do.

175
00:07:31.660 --> 00:07:32.880
I've never known it.

176
00:07:32.880 --> 00:07:34.140
For the thing is like this.

177
00:07:34.140 --> 00:07:37.880
I was sick a few months ago and went on the shit that everyone else had.

178
00:07:38.240 --> 00:07:40.260
And I was stuffed in connection with that.

179
00:07:40.260 --> 00:07:41.840
I was stuffed in connection with that.

180
00:07:41.840 --> 00:07:42.980
It was several months ago.

181
00:07:43.080 --> 00:07:47.020
After all, I was cold and thought "my nasal congestion goes over soon."

182
00:07:47.020 --> 00:07:48.020
When I'm healthy.

183
00:07:48.220 --> 00:07:53.340
It still lasts.
 It has lasted several months and I take nasal spray every day.

184
00:07:54.620 --> 00:07:57.280
And I have begun to realize then that it is clear as hell that it is pollen.

185
00:07:57.280 --> 00:07:59.140
It's pollen 100%.

186
00:07:59.140 --> 00:08:00.660
I have never felt that ever

187
00:08:00.660 --> 00:08:03.920
I still stand by being a pollen allergist.

188
00:08:03.920 --> 00:08:05.200
I'm pretty proud to say that.

189
00:08:05.300 --> 00:08:07.660
You have 30 different nasal sprays.

190
00:08:07.660 --> 00:08:10.440
One in the car, one in the bag, one in the other bag.

191
00:08:10.440 --> 00:08:12.440
One in the backpack ..

192
00:08:12.600 --> 00:08:16.060
Do you know what it is called .. an addiction.

193
00:08:16.900 --> 00:08:20.800
You should actually go into rehab now when you turn 30.

194
00:08:20.800 --> 00:08:23.460
I don't like when the butter melts so I usually stand like this.

195
00:08:23.460 --> 00:08:25.940
You want it to go fling down and forth.

196
00:08:26.140 --> 00:08:29.360
The bread is like this *screams *.

197
00:08:32.440 --> 00:08:34.440
Oh my God.

198
00:08:35.040 --> 00:08:38.180
I think it is damn nice that it is summer for all plans.

199
00:08:38.380 --> 00:08:40.380
I'm going to renovate all summer.

200
00:08:40.380 --> 00:08:41.220
Right.'

201
00:08:43.100 --> 00:08:45.100
It goes so well.

202
00:08:45.100 --> 00:08:46.040
I'll get the keys next week.

203
00:08:47.820 --> 00:08:49.300
Hallelujah.

204
00:08:49.300 --> 00:08:50.500
The keys next week

205
00:08:50.500 --> 00:08:51.180
Fun

206
00:08:52.220 --> 00:08:53.380
We set off right away

207
00:08:53.660 --> 00:08:55.660
Do you want to tell me a little then

208
00:08:55.660 --> 00:08:57.220
It's an apartment, a third.

209
00:08:57.340 --> 00:08:58.360
On 77 ..

210
00:08:58.360 --> 00:08:59.380
Expensive

211
00:08:59.460 --> 00:09:01.460
13 million.

212
00:09:03.480 --> 00:09:04.240
20 million ..

213
00:09:04.240 --> 00:09:05.720
Mine costs 50.

214
00:09:07.220 --> 00:09:08.320
It's totally okay.

215
00:09:10.980 --> 00:09:12.400
I tried to go pretty cheap anyway.

216
00:09:12.680 --> 00:09:14.680
I have 5 more ..

217
00:09:14.760 --> 00:09:18.680
The thing is that I should buy another one.

218
00:09:20.480 --> 00:09:22.480
The thing is that I bought the whole house.

219
00:09:22.480 --> 00:09:24.460
I bought the entire property.

220
00:09:27.540 --> 00:09:29.540
So we will build a big fucking house.

221
00:09:29.780 --> 00:09:32.960
We will have three balconies and five outdoor pools.

222
00:09:33.100 --> 00:09:35.100
Out towards the horizon, they should go.

223
00:09:35.100 --> 00:09:36.300
Do you have a room for me

224
00:09:37.020 --> 00:09:37.520
No

225
00:09:37.520 --> 00:09:40.660
Shit what I shudder when I talk like that.

226
00:09:41.020 --> 00:09:43.020
In all cases.
 We will start the renovation.

227
00:09:43.200 --> 00:09:45.200
We will move in mid -September type.

228
00:09:45.200 --> 00:09:46.120
Oh..

229
00:09:46.120 --> 00:09:48.100
Or yes...

230
00:09:48.100 --> 00:09:49.040
Where are you going..

231
00:09:49.040 --> 00:09:50.080
Home to you I thought.

232
00:09:50.080 --> 00:09:52.120
Well

233
00:09:52.120 --> 00:09:53.360
Okay..

234
00:09:53.400 --> 00:09:54.940
There have been many this past week.

235
00:09:55.200 --> 00:09:59.040
I would move out, held on like that.

236
00:09:59.380 --> 00:10:01.380
I thought more, how many will live with me

237
00:10:01.400 --> 00:10:03.400
Open house is it at your home.

238
00:10:03.680 --> 00:10:05.940
I should have spent 20 million instead of 15.

239
00:10:05.940 --> 00:10:07.940
A few rooms extra just.

240
00:10:08.120 --> 00:10:10.660
How are the love life going to date something?

241
00:10:11.840 --> 00:10:13.700
Have you snapped something lately

242
00:10:13.700 --> 00:10:15.620
Cleaning .. Type just an orange.

243
00:10:15.620 --> 00:10:17.620
For real, do you have it

244
00:10:17.660 --> 00:10:19.660
Nah

245
00:10:19.660 --> 00:10:20.740
Not late.

246
00:10:21.240 --> 00:10:23.240
Have I snatched no I haven't cheated anything.

247
00:10:23.440 --> 00:10:25.440
Not late but it's 100% easy.

248
00:10:25.440 --> 00:10:26.360
Last, when was it

249
00:10:26.360 --> 00:10:29.160
It may surely be that I have palled an apple or something.

250
00:10:29.240 --> 00:10:31.240
Pall an apple from a tree, they are free.

251
00:10:31.240 --> 00:10:33.680
Are you the way that goes in the store, opens a banana and eat on it

252
00:10:33.900 --> 00:10:37.460
No, but when I'm with the kids and they say * I'm really sucking * I say type "Eat."

253
00:10:38.260 --> 00:10:40.240
Then I always pay.

254
00:10:40.240 --> 00:10:42.800
I save the banana peel so they can scan it.

255
00:10:44.780 --> 00:10:46.780
So you can't do iofs.

256
00:10:47.160 --> 00:10:48.460
Do you like the apple powder

257
00:10:48.700 --> 00:10:50.700
Wait they weigh ..

258
00:10:50.700 --> 00:10:51.820
They do not scan the track.

259
00:10:51.960 --> 00:10:53.960
Just damn, I don't know how they solved it.

260
00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:56.000
This way, it weighs nothing, they have chewed it up.

261
00:10:56.220 --> 00:10:59.800
Forgive me but bananas are about the same size.

262
00:11:00.220 --> 00:11:01.240
Yes

263
00:11:02.527 --> 00:11:03.551
Yes

264
00:11:03.640 --> 00:11:05.640
Had sex

265
00:11:06.111 --> 00:11:06.623
No

266
00:11:06.623 --> 00:11:07.860
Not

267
00:11:07.860 --> 00:11:09.240
It's Sahara down there

268
00:11:09.380 --> 00:11:12.520
More than Sahara, it's kind ..

269
00:11:12.520 --> 00:11:13.820
Smalls.

270
00:11:16.960 --> 00:11:18.960
It really is, yourself then.
 Located a lot

271
00:11:18.960 --> 00:11:20.340
Aren't you out on tinder

272
00:11:20.703 --> 00:11:21.215
No

273
00:11:21.215 --> 00:11:22.340
Why

274
00:11:22.340 --> 00:11:23.140
And you

275
00:11:23.140 --> 00:11:24.340
Do you think I should it or

276
00:11:24.340 --> 00:11:25.100
Aa

277
00:11:25.100 --> 00:11:26.160
Åfan

278
00:11:26.160 --> 00:11:27.060
Is it true

279
00:11:28.180 --> 00:11:29.460
Yourself then, you lie or - yes

280
00:11:29.660 --> 00:11:30.420
You are really nice today

281
00:11:30.740 --> 00:11:32.740
I was just waiting for you to say so.

282
00:11:33.020 --> 00:11:38.020
Quite frankly now, do you get so much attention from someone than me

283
00:11:38.020 --> 00:11:39.160
Or by me.

284
00:11:39.160 --> 00:11:40.440
No one actually.

285
00:11:40.620 --> 00:11:45.540
If Jack sees this, I don't think you understand what you have to work on.

286
00:11:45.780 --> 00:11:50.300
Everything sits and looks at me where it should sit.

287
00:11:50.900 --> 00:11:55.860
Compare me then, my stuff sits like this.

288
00:11:57.060 --> 00:11:59.060
Mine is looking up.

289
00:11:59.060 --> 00:12:00.800
Yours sits *ding *

290
00:12:01.820 --> 00:12:03.820
Gooood morning

291
00:12:11.760 --> 00:12:13.760
Do you know what my tits are actually good.

292
00:12:14.020 --> 00:12:16.280
Is it something I really like ..

293
00:12:16.520 --> 00:12:17.680
In addition to money

294
00:12:17.680 --> 00:12:18.640
And my tits.

295
00:12:19.080 --> 00:12:19.740
Well

296
00:12:19.740 --> 00:12:20.240
That too.

297
00:12:20.240 --> 00:12:21.840
It's risifrutti.

298
00:12:22.600 --> 00:12:25.380
It's something I ... but it's actually a little fun.

299
00:12:26.239 --> 00:12:28.543
When you go on an excursion with school

300
00:12:28.543 --> 00:12:29.380
That's exactly what I would say.

301
00:12:29.820 --> 00:12:33.180
No you shouldn't say what I would say.

302
00:12:33.180 --> 00:12:33.840
Nehe.

303
00:12:33.840 --> 00:12:35.160
Now you are talking to me.

304
00:12:35.160 --> 00:12:36.220
Yes for once.

305
00:12:36.220 --> 00:12:36.720
Yes.

306
00:12:36.920 --> 00:12:43.000
But what I would say was that my friends always said: "I have rice frutti" like this luxurious stuff ...

307
00:12:43.180 --> 00:12:46.500
My family was always like this: "I make egg sandwiches or pancakes"

308
00:12:46.560 --> 00:12:48.720
There you sit with like wet ballerina biscuits.

309
00:12:49.060 --> 00:12:50.140
Yes exactly.

310
00:12:50.300 --> 00:12:51.780
I also want Risifrutti as well.

311
00:12:52.020 --> 00:12:52.740
I didn't get it.

312
00:12:52.800 --> 00:12:54.540
You know them here the peanut rings

313
00:12:54.540 --> 00:12:55.040
Yes.

314
00:12:55.240 --> 00:12:56.640
I always had such, always.

315
00:12:56.640 --> 00:12:57.900
But what it is like snacks

316
00:12:57.900 --> 00:12:59.400
Yes my parents happened in.

317
00:13:00.100 --> 00:13:02.320
Did you get a onion as well next to like a real jug

318
00:13:03.160 --> 00:13:04.660
A little meat and onion in a lunch box.

319
00:13:05.280 --> 00:13:06.480
Would you think i was a jug

320
00:13:06.480 --> 00:13:07.060
No.

321
00:13:07.060 --> 00:13:07.560
Nehe

322
00:13:07.720 --> 00:13:08.740
Well, a Serb maybe.

323
00:13:09.080 --> 00:13:10.500
MHM, why

324
00:13:10.500 --> 00:13:11.100
I do not know.

325
00:13:11.300 --> 00:13:12.580
What do you bases that on

326
00:13:12.580 --> 00:13:13.620
I do not know.

327
00:13:13.620 --> 00:13:14.440
Tell.

328
00:13:14.440 --> 00:13:14.960
I do not know.

329
00:13:14.960 --> 00:13:15.920
Can you stop looking at me

330
00:13:15.920 --> 00:13:16.500
Croat or Serb.

331
00:13:16.620 --> 00:13:19.500
Maybe pole, i don't know

332
00:13:19.680 --> 00:13:21.680
Yes, but because you do not look Swedish for five cents.

333
00:13:21.680 --> 00:13:23.740
Liberal no wait what is it, Libanes?

334
00:13:23.740 --> 00:13:24.400
Svenne

335
00:13:24.400 --> 00:13:25.080
No.

336
00:13:25.580 --> 00:13:26.080
No

337
00:13:26.460 --> 00:13:27.460
What will you do this summer

338
00:13:27.940 --> 00:13:31.120
So Croatia opens its boundaries now on the 15th.

339
00:13:31.120 --> 00:13:31.620
No

340
00:13:31.620 --> 00:13:32.120
Yes.

341
00:13:32.420 --> 00:13:33.140
For Sweden

342
00:13:33.720 --> 00:13:38.560
Yeah, it's Croatia and another country that has allowed you to go there.

343
00:13:38.580 --> 00:13:42.820
I'm so damn craving me and dad talk about it and he just: "Anto will we go the car"

344
00:13:43.340 --> 00:13:45.080
I am really tough, you should have more

345
00:13:45.080 --> 00:13:45.980
No.

346
00:13:45.980 --> 00:13:46.720
Only me is going to have more.

347
00:13:46.720 --> 00:13:50.740
So I can say a thing, I am also so eager to go down to Marbella.

348
00:13:51.580 --> 00:13:55.560
But I also like this, you can go I do not think that Spain will open to Sweden.

349
00:13:56.420 --> 00:13:59.480
So the thing is yes there are flights that go to Spain now.

350
00:13:59.680 --> 00:14:00.180
Mm.

351
00:14:00.960 --> 00:14:03.280
But the thing is that I think nothing is open down there.

352
00:14:03.720 --> 00:14:05.940
So it will be closed, half closed.

353
00:14:05.940 --> 00:14:07.180
It's fine for me I live in Jannie and Jon's castle.

354
00:14:07.580 --> 00:14:10.380
Yeah you like sliding on your friends' shrimp sandwich

355
00:14:10.380 --> 00:14:11.480
That's what I usually do.

356
00:14:12.080 --> 00:14:14.140
Like you usually pay my bills and such.

357
00:14:14.140 --> 00:14:15.920
Yes you grew up on Youtube because of me.

358
00:14:15.920 --> 00:14:16.980
Yes we have talked about that.

359
00:14:16.980 --> 00:14:17.660
*Antonija rap*

360
00:14:17.760 --> 00:14:19.760
But do we have to be like a bowl?

361
00:14:21.620 --> 00:14:23.460
I actually became it thanks to you.

362
00:14:23.460 --> 00:14:23.960
A youtube star.

363
00:14:24.020 --> 00:14:26.020
Have i told you how grateful I am for it

364
00:14:26.020 --> 00:14:26.660
You actually have that.

365
00:14:26.660 --> 00:14:27.300
Yes I have.

366
00:14:28.200 --> 00:14:34.480
I have told Antonija quite a few times that I am so grateful that you helped me.

367
00:14:34.480 --> 00:14:35.120
Important.

368
00:14:35.780 --> 00:14:36.280
To what

369
00:14:36.280 --> 00:14:37.060
To appreciate each other.

370
00:14:37.080 --> 00:14:39.380
You know I did a lashlift now.

371
00:14:40.560 --> 00:14:41.620
Do you appreciate me

372
00:14:41.620 --> 00:14:44.460
Yes I talked about it then because I said then that I want it as ready.

373
00:14:44.460 --> 00:14:46.900
And then I went in and scroll and just: "What is this"

374
00:14:46.900 --> 00:14:48.740
She just: "But it's medium bend"

375
00:14:48.740 --> 00:14:50.100
And I just: "What is ready for something"

376
00:14:50.640 --> 00:14:52.640
She just: "Medium" so I said I want as clear.

377
00:14:53.700 --> 00:14:54.920
You are a little in love with me.

378
00:14:54.920 --> 00:14:55.760
Yes it's me.

379
00:14:55.760 --> 00:14:56.820
But you don't admit it.

380
00:14:57.020 --> 00:14:58.840
Do you know what I feel sometimes

381
00:14:58.840 --> 00:14:59.780
That you are my little sister.

382
00:14:59.780 --> 00:15:00.280
Well.

383
00:15:00.620 --> 00:15:02.620
Or is it i who is your mother maybe

384
00:15:04.300 --> 00:15:04.980
Yes great fun ...

385
00:15:04.980 --> 00:15:08.480
Or if Antonija posted like this "inspo bathroom" the other day.

386
00:15:08.700 --> 00:15:10.200
Yes it is my bathroom you have described.

387
00:15:10.200 --> 00:15:11.820
But it was actually she who decided.

388
00:15:11.820 --> 00:15:13.720
Yes but you have probably said what you want.

389
00:15:13.860 --> 00:15:18.100
You just: "So I think a little you know gray walls, black taps"

390
00:15:22.180 --> 00:15:24.880
It was exactly the same disc cone with bud.

391
00:15:27.720 --> 00:15:28.800
I think it's great fun.

392
00:15:29.800 --> 00:15:31.500
But you can never give it to me ever.

393
00:15:31.820 --> 00:15:34.380
Why can't you give me, I like you.

394
00:15:34.740 --> 00:15:36.160
There they came there too.

395
00:15:37.240 --> 00:15:38.200
Equally stressed every time.

396
00:15:38.980 --> 00:15:41.340
It's like when the invoice for the rent will be asked no!

397
00:15:42.780 --> 00:15:43.740
Not again!

398
00:15:45.220 --> 00:15:46.840
So I'm so damn tired of paying invoices.

399
00:15:46.840 --> 00:15:48.580
It's something I don't want to do when I'm getting big.

400
00:15:49.540 --> 00:15:50.300
Pay invoices.

401
00:15:50.300 --> 00:15:55.000
So it's really like this: "Damn what a lot of money I make now, come in as much cash as possible and then just"

402
00:15:55.500 --> 00:15:56.560
It goes like this.

403
00:15:57.700 --> 00:16:00.900
No it goes like this and then just down and then just up.

404
00:16:01.140 --> 00:16:02.120
Yes but how fun is that

405
00:16:02.900 --> 00:16:08.200
How long should I have to work because I have no fucking Medelström who goes on this situation.

406
00:16:08.200 --> 00:16:09.560
No no you know what it is about

407
00:16:09.560 --> 00:16:11.000
We have to withdraw more money.

408
00:16:11.260 --> 00:16:12.240
Why are you shaking

409
00:16:12.240 --> 00:16:13.300
Is it money that starts it

410
00:16:13.300 --> 00:16:14.040
We have to be strippers I feel.

411
00:16:15.300 --> 00:16:15.800
Yes..

412
00:16:19.580 --> 00:16:21.040
But god what I shudder, feel

413
00:16:21.040 --> 00:16:22.260
But what are you shuddering over

414
00:16:22.260 --> 00:16:23.660
It's because you are sitting here.

415
00:16:24.200 --> 00:16:26.820
No but do you know what the only solution to this is

416
00:16:26.820 --> 00:16:27.500
what

417
00:16:27.820 --> 00:16:28.700
Earn more money.

418
00:16:28.700 --> 00:16:29.860
Yes

419
00:16:30.500 --> 00:16:31.720
Is it something you feel you want to do.

420
00:16:31.960 --> 00:16:33.100
Yes God yes

421
00:16:33.700 --> 00:16:34.760
Do you take out a good salary

422
00:16:34.760 --> 00:16:35.280
Yes I do.

423
00:16:37.100 --> 00:16:37.600
What do you charge in pay

424
00:16:37.620 --> 00:16:38.120
Salary

425
00:16:38.920 --> 00:16:39.440
SEK 45,000

426
00:16:40.060 --> 00:16:40.560
And you

427
00:16:40.560 --> 00:16:41.300
SEK 55,000.

428
00:16:42.980 --> 00:16:43.720
You don't do that at all.

429
00:16:43.720 --> 00:16:44.500
Well, I do.

430
00:16:44.780 --> 00:16:45.920
Then you have done it now.

431
00:16:46.020 --> 00:16:47.740
No I have been doing it for a few months now.

432
00:16:47.740 --> 00:16:50.060
But shut up because I know we take the same salary.

433
00:16:50.060 --> 00:16:54.240
Yes but after that I have taken out more so that I will fucking get an apartment.

434
00:16:55.220 --> 00:16:55.720
Oops.

435
00:16:56.300 --> 00:16:58.980
You know that .. Yes okay ...

436
00:16:59.820 --> 00:17:01.780
I call the auditor and only: "We have to raise the salary"

437
00:17:02.020 --> 00:17:02.580
Oh

438
00:17:04.880 --> 00:17:06.460
He was in the sun for a long time.

439
00:17:06.460 --> 00:17:08.300
Now we have to stop talking money.

440
00:17:08.300 --> 00:17:09.960
Because then these are the ones happening.

441
00:17:09.960 --> 00:17:10.900
Burnt brains.

442
00:17:10.920 --> 00:17:12.200
Do you know what I feel too

443
00:17:13.060 --> 00:17:14.260
I will probably actually go now.

444
00:17:14.260 --> 00:17:15.060
I am burnt out.

445
00:17:16.080 --> 00:17:17.900
This is what it looks like in my brain when I'm burned out.

446
00:17:19.640 --> 00:17:20.620
I'll say a thing.

447
00:17:20.620 --> 00:17:21.560
I have gone into the wall.

448
00:17:21.560 --> 00:17:24.240
Hello after this, I just want to say it when this one has come up.

449
00:17:25.040 --> 00:17:27.600
Then my other has come up because after this we will eat dessert.

450
00:17:28.060 --> 00:17:28.580
Cake

451
00:17:28.840 --> 00:17:32.020
Because it's my birthday.

452
00:17:44.320 --> 00:17:45.360
I like to be kissed like this.

453
00:17:48.820 --> 00:17:51.560
Did you know that these numbers are minutes.

454
00:17:51.920 --> 00:17:52.980
Well, no I didn't know.

455
00:17:52.980 --> 00:17:54.060
That is sick.

456
00:17:54.060 --> 00:17:55.400
I thought it was level 2.

457
00:17:55.400 --> 00:17:56.900
Level of burning.

458
00:17:57.640 --> 00:17:58.460
It's minutes.

459
00:17:58.460 --> 00:17:59.220
This is totally sick.

460
00:17:59.220 --> 00:18:03.040
But who wants it for 7 minutes then it becomes like a damn brick.

461
00:18:03.520 --> 00:18:04.020
Do not understand.

462
00:18:04.020 --> 00:18:04.840
What do they even mean

463
00:18:05.240 --> 00:18:05.980
No clue.

464
00:18:06.880 --> 00:18:08.540
Do you think I'm finer without fringes

465
00:18:08.760 --> 00:18:11.060
Much finer, it was a bit trashy before.

466
00:18:11.180 --> 00:18:11.680
Yes.

467
00:18:11.820 --> 00:18:13.180
But I think you are very nice.

468
00:18:13.200 --> 00:18:15.620
But what I don't understand is why you don't have mascara on the lashes

469
00:18:15.680 --> 00:18:18.020
Because I kind of think it weighs down my eyes.

470
00:18:18.020 --> 00:18:18.720
Yes I understand.

471
00:18:19.980 --> 00:18:21.780
You are very nice now overall I think.

472
00:18:22.180 --> 00:18:22.680
Thanks.

473
00:18:22.700 --> 00:18:24.260
But there is something with the lip

474
00:18:24.260 --> 00:18:27.540
But I have emptied now and then I'll start over completely.

475
00:18:27.540 --> 00:18:28.140
Yes I understand.

476
00:18:28.320 --> 00:18:31.100
Because I told Antonija it looks a bit like you are sniffing

477
00:18:31.100 --> 00:18:32.980
But also that you have inserted your lip.

478
00:18:33.140 --> 00:18:36.140
This is because this upper lip was emptied but not the lower lip.

479
00:18:36.140 --> 00:18:37.500
So I walk around like this.

480
00:18:37.660 --> 00:18:40.460
But I think the upper lip is very nice.

481
00:18:40.460 --> 00:18:41.280
Well

482
00:18:41.280 --> 00:18:42.340
Yes I don't think you need to fill.

483
00:18:42.720 --> 00:18:44.000
This was just that it was unfamiliar I think.

484
00:18:44.240 --> 00:18:45.040
Woah.

485
00:18:45.380 --> 00:18:47.540
But why should you have burnt out sandwiches

486
00:18:47.540 --> 00:18:49.420
*Antonija screams*

487
00:18:49.420 --> 00:18:51.300
They have entered the rust not into the wall.

488
00:18:51.540 --> 00:18:52.660
But now Antonija is enough.

489
00:18:52.900 --> 00:18:53.780
Can i eat this one

490
00:18:53.780 --> 00:18:55.640
Yes and then you do this.

491
00:18:55.700 --> 00:18:57.520
I'll give you a lifehack.

492
00:18:57.520 --> 00:18:58.020
I know..

493
00:18:58.060 --> 00:19:00.600
Because when this one has been released on Antonija's channel, I have turned 30.

494
00:19:00.860 --> 00:19:07.780
And in order for you to see when we celebrate Klara, I think you should go down in the description and press the link for where it will be cake party!

495
00:19:08.060 --> 00:19:10.060
There it will be a party!

496
00:19:20.740 --> 00:19:22.120
See you in a few days.

497
00:19:22.120 --> 00:19:23.260
No but in a few days

498
00:19:23.260 --> 00:19:24.600
Should you exit this vlog

499
00:19:24.600 --> 00:19:25.620
Yeah okay.

500
00:19:25.720 --> 00:19:28.100
After all, you have learned your homework with shutting up.

501
00:19:28.240 --> 00:19:31.140
Thank you for you, what is this section 9?

502
00:19:31.140 --> 00:19:31.960
It is more.

503
00:19:31.960 --> 00:19:32.700
No.

504
00:19:32.800 --> 00:19:33.300
I promise.

505
00:19:33.300 --> 00:19:37.440
So we are so damn awesome, thank you for following us, thank you for sitting and jawing with us.

506
00:19:38.720 --> 00:19:39.620
See you next week maybe.

507
00:19:40.080 --> 00:19:40.580
We'll do that.

508
00:19:40.580 --> 00:19:44.180
It sounds good to say so, see you next week, kiss pussy, bye

509
00:19:44.180 --> 00:19:46.100
It sounds like we have a TV show, so we should have that.

510
00:19:46.300 --> 00:19:48.100
So TV contact me, or us.

511
00:19:48.600 --> 00:19:49.620
TV, Internet.

512
00:19:50.140 --> 00:19:50.860
Internet.

513
00:19:50.860 --> 00:19:53.380
Internet Contact us We want a talk show.

514
00:19:53.380 --> 00:19:55.680
It's something we should have, think about taking guests and grilling them in the hot chair.

515
00:19:55.840 --> 00:19:58.420
If you want it, I think you should write to TV and say this ...

516
00:19:58.420 --> 00:19:59.980
And then you tag type #TV4.

517
00:20:00.900 --> 00:20:01.420
