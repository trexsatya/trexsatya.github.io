1
00:00:09,500 --> 00:00:14,016
The time is 6:30 in the morning December 1

2
00:00:14,100 --> 00:00:17,600
1948. On the outskirts

3
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:20,600
by the city of Adelaide in Australia

4
00:00:20,600 --> 00:00:26,516
At a place called Somerton Beach discovers some people at the beach

5
00:00:26,600 --> 00:00:30,666
A dead man.

6
00:00:30,750 --> 00:00:34,383
The police were called and blocked off the area.

7
00:00:34,466 --> 00:00:37,466
The dead man lay on his back in the sand.

8
00:00:37,616 --> 00:00:43,416
The head leaned against a beach wall and the feet were crossed over each other.

9
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:45,916
There were no signs of battle and the man

10
00:00:45,916 --> 00:00:49,600
had no wounds or injuries.

11
00:00:49,666 --> 00:00:51,750
He was 180 centimeters long.

12
00:00:51,750 --> 00:00:55,100
Gray eyes, reddish brown hair that had begun to turn gray

13
00:00:55,100 --> 00:00:58,100
in the temples.
 Between 40 to 50 years old

14
00:00:58,216 --> 00:01:02,366
And weighed about 80 kilos.

15
00:01:02,450 --> 00:01:06,700
All the labels on his clothes had been removed.

16
00:01:06,766 --> 00:01:11,550
What the man was wearing in his pockets was as follows:

17
00:01:11,550 --> 00:01:15,600
1 unused train ticket from Adelaide to Henley Beach.

18
00:01:15,683 --> 00:01:19,683
1 bus ticket from Adelaide that was not used.

19
00:01:19,766 --> 00:01:23,650
1 narrow aluminum comb made in the United States.

20
00:01:23,716 --> 00:01:26,966
1 half -empty package with Juicy Fruit chewing gum.

21
00:01:27,050 --> 00:01:35,400
1 cigarette package with the Army Club brand and a box of matches.

22
00:01:35,483 --> 00:01:38,700
But the man could not be identified.

23
00:01:38,783 --> 00:01:42,966
He had no wallet on so you couldn't find any driver's license

24
00:01:43,050 --> 00:01:47,516
or other type of identification.

25
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:48,983
The day after the body

26
00:01:48,983 --> 00:01:52,100
found contacted police potential witnesses

27
00:01:52,100 --> 00:01:55,833
In an attempt to learn more about the man's last hours.

28
00:01:55,916 --> 00:01:59,900
Several people reported that they saw a man similar to that

29
00:01:59,900 --> 00:02:05,216
Unknown man at Somerton Beach the night before the body was found.

30
00:02:05,300 --> 00:02:08,066
The witnesses described how they saw a man sit alone

31
00:02:08,066 --> 00:02:11,066
towards the wall and look out at the sea.

32
00:02:11,266 --> 00:02:13,733
But no one could ensure

33
00:02:13,733 --> 00:02:17,250
That it was the same person.

34
00:02:17,333 --> 00:02:19,650
The man's fingerprints gave no hit

35
00:02:19,650 --> 00:02:24,183
In the police register, he did not seem to have a criminal past.

36
00:02:24,266 --> 00:02:27,116
The autopsy of the body began a few days

37
00:02:27,116 --> 00:02:30,266
after it was discovered and the forensic doctor noted

38
00:02:30,466 --> 00:02:36,550
That the man's shoes were remarkably clean and recently plastered,

39
00:02:36,616 --> 00:02:40,833
Which was unexpected for a man found on a beach.

40
00:02:40,916 --> 00:02:45,033
No obvious signs of violence or trauma were found.

41
00:02:45,116 --> 00:02:47,716
Instead indicated some signs of

42
00:02:47,716 --> 00:02:51,566
that the cause of death could be poisoning,

43
00:02:51,650 --> 00:02:54,266
But one could not find any poison in the body

44
00:02:54,266 --> 00:02:58,083
and there was no clear evidence of vomiting or cramps,

45
00:02:58,166 --> 00:03:02,466
which are common bodily reactions to poisoning.

46
00:03:02,550 --> 00:03:05,416
So the shoes were clean and polished ..

47
00:03:05,416 --> 00:03:09,716
No signs of violence and the man had not vomited any poison ..

48
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:12,716
May the man have died somewhere else

49
00:03:12,716 --> 00:03:16,833
And then been moved to the beach?

50
00:03:16,916 --> 00:03:18,350
In December the same year,

51
00:03:18,350 --> 00:03:22,766
As a last resort to try to identify the unknown man

52
00:03:22,850 --> 00:03:28,116
Made the police a plaster cast of the man's face and bonfire.

53
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:32,266
This casting would become a central part of the investigation

54
00:03:32,483 --> 00:03:38,216
and used several times for a possible identification of the man.

55
00:03:38,300 --> 00:03:41,950
Although a definitive cause of death could not be determined

56
00:03:42,016 --> 00:03:45,016
was the mystery far from over.

57
00:03:45,150 --> 00:03:48,500
There was still no clue about who the man was or

58
00:03:48,500 --> 00:03:52,450
Why he died under these strange circumstances.

59
00:03:52,516 --> 00:03:56,250
The forensic doctor and the police were facing more questions

60
00:03:56,333 --> 00:03:59,333
even answers and it soon became clear

61
00:03:59,450 --> 00:04:10,200
That this case was far from the ordinary.

62
00:04:10,283 --> 00:04:13,466
January 14, 1949,

63
00:04:13,666 --> 00:04:19,166
about a month after the unknown man was found dead, so the staff discovered

64
00:04:19,166 --> 00:04:25,500
At Adelaide Railway Station A brown suitcase in their luggage storage

65
00:04:25,583 --> 00:04:30,450
that has not been picked up.

66
00:04:30,533 --> 00:04:32,000
The suitcase had been checked

67
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:35,000
into the storage on November 30.

68
00:04:35,100 --> 00:04:38,183
1948, thus the day

69
00:04:38,183 --> 00:04:42,333
before the man had been found dead by the beach.

70
00:04:42,416 --> 00:04:48,566
Inside the bag were found several different things.

71
00:04:48,650 --> 00:04:49,950
A bathrobe,

72
00:04:49,950 --> 00:04:54,000
A pair of slippers, underwear, pajamas and shaving articles.

73
00:04:54,150 --> 00:04:56,250
Pants.

74
00:04:56,250 --> 00:04:56,966
An electrician chisel

75
00:04:56,966 --> 00:05:00,050
A modified table knife and a pair of scissors.

76
00:05:00,150 --> 00:05:02,216
A stencil brush.

77
00:05:02,216 --> 00:05:07,533
A wire short with orange waxed wire of the brand Barbour

78
00:05:07,616 --> 00:05:12,933
And clothing with the tag T.Keane.
 Keane.

79
00:05:13,016 --> 00:05:16,983
And just Kean without an E at the end.

80
00:05:17,066 --> 00:05:20,066
Also three dry cleaning markings.

81
00:05:20,250 --> 00:05:23,666
1171/7, 4393/7

82
00:05:23,700 --> 00:05:27,266
3053/7

83
00:05:27,350 --> 00:05:30,550
All other labels on the clothes had been removed.

84
00:05:30,616 --> 00:05:34,050
Just like with the dead man on the beach.

85
00:05:34,133 --> 00:05:36,316
The markings with T.Keane

86
00:05:36,316 --> 00:05:39,966
Keane and Kean were of great interest to the police.

87
00:05:40,050 --> 00:05:44,066
They tried to track a person named T.Keane

88
00:05:44,150 --> 00:05:48,566
But they found no records of any missing person with that name,

89
00:05:48,650 --> 00:05:51,350
whether in Australia or in something

90
00:05:51,350 --> 00:05:54,516
other English -speaking land and

91
00:05:54,533 --> 00:05:59,583
The dry cleaning markings also provided no clues or any useful information.

92
00:05:59,666 --> 00:06:03,416
The things in the suitcase unfortunately gave no more answers to who the man

93
00:06:03,416 --> 00:06:08,433
Also, each one could not determine that the bag belonged to the man.

94
00:06:08,516 --> 00:06:13,266
But it was a detail that particularly caught the police's attention.

95
00:06:13,350 --> 00:06:16,283
The orange waxed thread card

96
00:06:16,283 --> 00:06:19,600
of the Barbour brand found in the bag.

97
00:06:19,666 --> 00:06:22,666
It had a very specific type of thread

98
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:27,183
that was not available in Australia and the police

99
00:06:27,266 --> 00:06:30,900
had never been able to guess that this thread

100
00:06:30,983 --> 00:06:33,983
Would be very relevant in the investigation.

101
00:06:34,050 --> 00:06:38,833
A few months later...

102
00:06:38,916 --> 00:06:40,066
In June

103
00:06:40,066 --> 00:06:44,166
1949, they examined the man's clothes again

104
00:06:44,250 --> 00:06:48,566
And found a hidden pocket inside the man's pants.

105
00:06:48,650 --> 00:06:51,966
Inside the pocket there was a small patch

106
00:06:52,050 --> 00:06:56,050
And that seemed to be out of a book.

107
00:06:56,116 --> 00:07:00,016
Upon closer examination, it turned out that the patch had been sewn

108
00:07:00,016 --> 00:07:05,133
into the hidden pocket with an orange thread.

109
00:07:05,216 --> 00:07:10,450
The same thread they had found in the suitcase earlier.

110
00:07:10,516 --> 00:07:13,516
On the patch the words stood

111
00:07:13,583 --> 00:07:20,733
Tamám Shud

112
00:07:20,816 --> 00:07:22,100
No one within the police

113
00:07:22,100 --> 00:07:25,900
knew what the words meant but a local police reporter

114
00:07:25,966 --> 00:07:31,400
Frank Kennedy, who worked at the newspaper Adelaide Advertiser, recognized

115
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:35,100
the script from a book with Persian poems called

116
00:07:35,183 --> 00:07:38,116
Rubáiyát of Omar Khayyám

117
00:07:38,116 --> 00:07:42,316
To confirm this, the police turned to experts who could identify

118
00:07:42,316 --> 00:07:46,083
and translate the words tamám shud

119
00:07:46,166 --> 00:07:54,150
Like "it's over" or "it's done."

120
00:07:54,233 --> 00:07:55,583
Rubáiyát of Omar Khayyám

121
00:07:55,583 --> 00:07:59,366
is a collection of poems of the Persian mathematician,

122
00:07:59,566 --> 00:08:04,683
Astronomer and poet Omar Khayyám who lived on the thousands.

123
00:08:04,766 --> 00:08:08,966
Rubáiyát is a term from the Persian poetry that means

124
00:08:09,050 --> 00:08:14,516
"Kvatriner", which is a type of poem written with four lines.

125
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:19,816
The book was well known, but finding the right edition, as the note may have been driven from,

126
00:08:20,066 --> 00:08:26,850
turned out to be a challenge.

127
00:08:26,933 --> 00:08:30,550
They began to search all bookstores and libraries in Adelaide

128
00:08:30,616 --> 00:08:35,350
And nearby cities, but without success.

129
00:08:35,416 --> 00:08:38,250
When it did not give any success, they asked the public about

130
00:08:38,250 --> 00:08:41,266
help where they showed off the book they were looking for

131
00:08:41,483 --> 00:08:45,566
And the specific font contained by the book.

132
00:08:45,650 --> 00:08:54,450
And finally, the police were a little luck.

133
00:08:54,533 --> 00:08:57,866
July 22, 1949

134
00:08:57,950 --> 00:09:01,233
came a man to the police with a copy of

135
00:09:01,316 --> 00:09:05,350
Rubáiyát he had found in his brother -in -law's car.

136
00:09:05,416 --> 00:09:10,466
He said someone had thrown the book into the rear seat of the car through a

137
00:09:10,466 --> 00:09:15,233
Open window November 30, 1948,

138
00:09:15,450 --> 00:09:22,716
While it was parked a block away from Somerton Beach

139
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:24,533
All signs pointed out that it

140
00:09:24,533 --> 00:09:30,300
Here the copy of the poetry book was the book from which the paper was brought.

141
00:09:30,383 --> 00:09:32,750
The police browse up to the correct side

142
00:09:32,750 --> 00:09:35,750
In the book and there it was a hole,

143
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:39,566
Just as if someone has ripped out some of it.

144
00:09:39,650 --> 00:09:44,466
The police brought out the torn note with the text Tamám Shud

145
00:09:44,550 --> 00:09:49,000
And very real,

146
00:09:49,066 --> 00:09:58,900
They fit like two perfect puzzle pieces.

147
00:09:58,966 --> 00:10:03,000
Although the mystery of the stirred patch was now loose

148
00:10:03,083 --> 00:10:07,233
So the book had more secrets to reveal.

149
00:10:07,316 --> 00:10:11,050
Inside the book were found two very interesting things.

150
00:10:11,116 --> 00:10:16,116
A phone number written on the back of the book in pencil

151
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:23,283
and also a mysterious pattern of letters.

152
00:10:23,366 --> 00:10:28,050
If we start with the phone number, who belonged to it?

153
00:10:28,133 --> 00:10:31,566
Police quickly discovered that the phone number was unlisted,

154
00:10:31,650 --> 00:10:34,650
but managed to track it to a residence

155
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:38,050
that lay on Mosley Street in Glenelg

156
00:10:38,116 --> 00:10:43,200
About 400 meters north of where the body was found.

157
00:10:43,283 --> 00:10:45,500
The dwelling belonged to a young woman

158
00:10:45,500 --> 00:10:48,500
named Jessica Thomson, 27 years.

159
00:10:48,650 --> 00:10:55,650
She worked as a nurse and was married to a man named Prosper Thomson.

160
00:10:55,733 --> 00:10:57,383
She was taken to the wedding house for

161
00:10:57,383 --> 00:11:01,716
To consider the plaster casting of the man's face and bonfire.

162
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:06,333
When she saw the casting her breathing stopped.

163
00:11:06,416 --> 00:11:09,316
The color disappeared from her face.

164
00:11:09,316 --> 00:11:12,783
She looked to be on the verge of fainting.

165
00:11:12,866 --> 00:11:17,550
It was a very strong reaction, especially for someone who was a nurse

166
00:11:17,550 --> 00:11:21,183
during the war and certainly seen much worse things

167
00:11:21,266 --> 00:11:24,783
than a plaster cast of a dead body.

168
00:11:24,866 --> 00:11:28,200
The investigators concluded that her reaction was due to

169
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:33,266
Some form of emotional connection to the deceased man.

170
00:11:33,350 --> 00:11:35,483
Despite this, Jessica denied

171
00:11:35,483 --> 00:11:39,483
That she recognized him.

172
00:11:39,566 --> 00:11:40,700
When it came to the book

173
00:11:40,700 --> 00:11:46,800
Rubáiyát and why her phone number was written on the back she admitted that she previously

174
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:52,566
owned a copy she gave to a soldier named Alfred Boxall

175
00:11:52,650 --> 00:11:55,500
in Sydney during wartime.

176
00:11:55,500 --> 00:11:58,833
She did not reveal specific details about their relationship,

177
00:11:58,916 --> 00:12:04,200
But the investigators suspected that it could have been a romantic connection.

178
00:12:04,283 --> 00:12:07,133
What this alfred boxall the

179
00:12:07,133 --> 00:12:10,800
did the somertonman die by the beach?

180
00:12:10,883 --> 00:12:15,750
And was he a lover for Jessica Thomson?

181
00:12:15,833 --> 00:12:19,283
One theory was that Alfred had chosen to end his life

182
00:12:19,316 --> 00:12:23,966
After he could never win Jessica's heart altogether.

183
00:12:24,050 --> 00:12:27,016
But this theory was quickly allowed to close down.

184
00:12:27,016 --> 00:12:30,933
Alfred Boxall was discovered to be alive

185
00:12:31,016 --> 00:12:33,766
and he had also retained his copy

186
00:12:33,766 --> 00:12:38,433
by Rubáiyát as he had received from Jessica and in that book

187
00:12:38,516 --> 00:12:42,516
Had no one torn out the words you have driven.

188
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:47,166
This track had to be put on ice.

189
00:12:47,250 --> 00:12:50,116
And then we had the mysterious letters.

190
00:12:50,116 --> 00:12:55,150
The pattern consisted of five rows with seemingly random letters,

191
00:12:55,216 --> 00:12:58,650
One of the lines was overlined.

192
00:12:58,733 --> 00:13:01,916
Was this a coded message?

193
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:05,000
And if so, who had written it?

194
00:13:05,216 --> 00:13:07,066
And what did it mean?

195
00:13:07,066 --> 00:13:10,616
Investigators had no idea and code experts were called in

196
00:13:10,616 --> 00:13:13,616
To help solve the cryptic puzzle.

197
00:13:13,766 --> 00:13:17,666
But try after attempt failed.

198
00:13:17,750 --> 00:13:20,700
The code message in Rubáiyát has fascinated

199
00:13:20,700 --> 00:13:24,566
and frustrated code crusher for over 70 years.

200
00:13:24,650 --> 00:13:29,250
The five rows of apparently random letters are challenging

201
00:13:29,250 --> 00:13:32,966
Still the best cryptographers in the world.

202
00:13:33,050 --> 00:13:37,000
Is this a personal memory method?

203
00:13:37,066 --> 00:13:40,066
A kind of cryptic poem?

204
00:13:40,283 --> 00:13:43,900
Or maybe instructions for a secret assignment?

205
00:13:43,966 --> 00:13:48,316
Nobody knows.
 But it is, among other things, this particular mystery that has

206
00:13:48,316 --> 00:13:52,166
Keep the mystery with the Somertonman alive.

207
00:13:52,250 --> 00:13:56,133
Each generation takes on the challenge of solving it

208
00:13:56,216 --> 00:13:59,000
in the hope of finally giving answers to the riddle

209
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:04,033
about who the unknown man really was.

210
00:14:04,116 --> 00:14:06,050
For in spite of all these years of

211
00:14:06,050 --> 00:14:10,716
surveys, despite the countless hours of research,

212
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:14,216
theories and guesses, is still a

213
00:14:14,216 --> 00:14:18,933
Ask that remains unanswered.

214
00:14:19,016 --> 00:14:26,650
Who was the Somertonman?

215
00:14:26,716 --> 00:14:27,316
Over the years

216
00:14:27,316 --> 00:14:31,166
As followed, a lot of different theories have emerged.

217
00:14:31,250 --> 00:14:34,733
In early January 1949 identified

218
00:14:34,733 --> 00:14:38,516
two people the body as 63 -year -old

219
00:14:38,516 --> 00:14:41,516
Robert Walsh, a former loggers

220
00:14:41,750 --> 00:14:45,083
Walsh had left Adelaide several months earlier to buy

221
00:14:45,083 --> 00:14:49,616
Sheep in Queensland, but had not returned to Christmas as planned.

222
00:14:49,700 --> 00:14:53,516
But the hands of the somerton were Lena and soft

223
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:57,866
And they indicated that he did not cut any trees for at least 18 months.

224
00:14:57,950 --> 00:15:01,500
and that Walsh had a specific scar on the body

225
00:15:01,583 --> 00:15:05,250
that the Somertonman did not have.

226
00:15:05,333 --> 00:15:07,766
Another theory was that the Somertonman was a

227
00:15:07,766 --> 00:15:11,666
Sailor named Tommy Reade from the ship SS Cycle

228
00:15:11,666 --> 00:15:16,166
which was in port at the time when the body was found.

229
00:15:16,250 --> 00:15:19,816
But after some of his sailor comrades had seen the body

230
00:15:19,816 --> 00:15:25,266
At the stretcher, they explained that the body was not Tommy read.

231
00:15:25,350 --> 00:15:26,216
Another and

232
00:15:26,216 --> 00:15:29,333
one of the most popular and prolonged theories

233
00:15:29,333 --> 00:15:33,566
is that the Somertonman was a foreign spy,

234
00:15:33,650 --> 00:15:36,016
Possibly of Soviet descent,

235
00:15:36,016 --> 00:15:39,300
who was in Australia during the Cold War.

236
00:15:39,383 --> 00:15:44,316
This theory arose because of the mysterious circumstances surrounding his death.

237
00:15:44,400 --> 00:15:47,250
The unidentifiable code in Rubáiyát

238
00:15:47,250 --> 00:15:50,250
and that no one seems to have known him,

239
00:15:50,300 --> 00:15:53,700
and that the labels of his clothes were missing,

240
00:15:53,783 --> 00:15:59,316
Which was common for spies.

241
00:15:59,400 --> 00:16:01,583
In November 1953

242
00:16:01,583 --> 00:16:08,600
The police announced that they received over 250 “solutions” (tips) to the body's identity

243
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:13,800
from the public who claimed that they either met or felt him.

244
00:16:13,883 --> 00:16:19,616
But none of the clues led anywhere.

245
00:16:19,700 --> 00:16:25,666
It would take until July 26, 2022 when one

246
00:16:25,666 --> 00:16:28,666
Finally had a breakthrough in the case.

247
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:31,733
The Somertonman had been buried a long time ago.

248
00:16:31,733 --> 00:16:37,316
But inside the plaster cast of the Somertonman found small hairs

249
00:16:37,400 --> 00:16:40,400
and through them one could implement a DNA

250
00:16:40,400 --> 00:16:44,066
Analysis and genealogy.

251
00:16:44,150 --> 00:16:47,916
And then you got a hit ..

252
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:51,216
The man on the beach was identified as

253
00:16:51,300 --> 00:16:54,016
Carl "Charles" web,

254
00:16:54,016 --> 00:16:57,783
An electrical engineer and instrument manufacturer.

255
00:16:57,866 --> 00:17:04,233
Born November 16, 1905 in Melbourne, Australia.

256
00:17:04,316 --> 00:17:07,200
Carl Charles Webb was the youngest of sex

257
00:17:07,200 --> 00:17:10,200
Children to Richard and Eliza Webb.

258
00:17:10,200 --> 00:17:16,150
He came from simple conditions but worked his way up to become a skilled professional.

259
00:17:16,216 --> 00:17:20,050
In 1941 he married Dorothy Robertsson,

260
00:17:20,116 --> 00:17:23,433
A pharmacist and foot therapist.

261
00:17:23,516 --> 00:17:28,766
The marriage was messy, characterized by Carl's difficult personality,

262
00:17:28,850 --> 00:17:33,950
Dorothy described Karl as a lone man with few friends who lived

263
00:17:33,950 --> 00:17:39,066
A withdrawn life and went to bed at seven every night.

264
00:17:39,150 --> 00:17:42,766
He could seem calm, but his mood could swing vigorously

265
00:17:42,766 --> 00:17:48,300
And then he became violent and threatening.

266
00:17:48,383 --> 00:17:49,166
After years

267
00:17:49,166 --> 00:17:54,100
of this destructive relationship forced Carl to move out

268
00:17:54,166 --> 00:17:58,550
In 1947 and just one year later

269
00:17:58,583 --> 00:18:05,100
he was found dead on the beach at Somerton Beach in Adelaide.

270
00:18:05,183 --> 00:18:06,500
During that time could

271
00:18:06,500 --> 00:18:10,300
man to determine that Dorothy lived in the city of Bute

272
00:18:10,366 --> 00:18:14,350
144 kilometers from Adelaide.

273
00:18:14,416 --> 00:18:18,116
Maybe it might have been so that Carl had gone

274
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:21,200
to Adelaide with the intention of trying to find her.

275
00:18:21,383 --> 00:18:26,650
Nobody knows.

276
00:18:26,716 --> 00:18:27,916
Even though the mystery

277
00:18:27,916 --> 00:18:30,916
with the Somertonman's identity was resolved

278
00:18:30,916 --> 00:18:35,550
So there were still unanswered questions with the case.

279
00:18:35,633 --> 00:18:37,816
Why did he have the patch with the text

280
00:18:37,816 --> 00:18:41,133
Tamám Shud sewn into his pants?

281
00:18:41,216 --> 00:18:46,000
What did the mysterious letters mean on the back of Rubáiyát

282
00:18:46,066 --> 00:18:49,416
Who threw the book into the car?

283
00:18:49,500 --> 00:18:52,683
Was it himself or anyone else?

284
00:18:52,766 --> 00:18:55,133
Why did Jessica Thomson react so

285
00:18:55,133 --> 00:18:58,900
Strong when she saw the plaster casting?

286
00:18:58,966 --> 00:19:04,116
Questions that we may never get answers to.

287
00:19:04,200 --> 00:19:06,083
It is still believed that he chose

288
00:19:06,083 --> 00:19:10,116
to end one's life by poisoning oneself.

289
00:19:10,200 --> 00:19:12,616
But how he did it,

290
00:19:12,616 --> 00:19:15,000
why he did that

291
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:19,533
and which poison he used is still

292
00:19:19,616 --> 00:19:22,550
a mystery.

293
00:19:22,550 --> 00:19:24,916
Thanks for watching!
