1
00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:33.320
-Thanks!
 -Thanks.

2
00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:39.280
Welcome to shrimp frozen.

3
00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:43.360
We have two exciting competitions -

4
00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:48.920
- And so comes our lifestyle consultant Henrik Elmér!

5
00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:54.840
Last time, a long -awaited guest comes here - Robert Gustafsson!

6
00:00:59.080 --> 00:01:04.880
- You look a little worn out, Johan.
 - Yes, I sleep poorly at night.

7
00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:10.720
It's a bad now.
 My girlfriend left me - four years ago.

8
00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:20.200
I sat at the computer all night and had cyber sex with a dyslexic.

9
00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:25.960
It was frustrating.
 "What the hell writes man?"

10
00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:32.720
Finally, I fake my orgasm.

11
00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:36.800
I wrote: "Oh, the ground shits ..."

12
00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:43.680
My dad got a computer a while ago and it's hopeless!

13
00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:50.720
He browses all day - and double - click on the lamp buttons at home!

14
00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:59.280
He empties his mailbox all the time and puts bookmarks in the Mushroom Forest.

15
00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:06.720
Dad asks: "Are you sure you will throw the garbage? Yes, no, cancel?"

16
00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:11.760
There are disadvantages, but I need to meet people.

17
00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:16.760
- You were out this weekend?
 - Yes, but Jimmy was with ...

18
00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:22.080
Hello guys.

19
00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:27.840
What evening we had yesterday!
 Huh?

20
00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:36.800
No, I agree ... What are we doing?

21
00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:43.640
Every night the same thing.
 Any evening ...

22
00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:48.120
So full - why do we get it?

23
00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:53.600
When did we go out and have a beer last?
 It has never happened!

24
00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:56.760
I take two and ...

25
00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:04.080
Sorry!
 The gay, come back!
 Kick me in the ass.

26
00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:08.840
Oh, those girls!

27
00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:16.400
They were as boring, like three of my hurts, and just stood on the floor.

28
00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:20.680
Although the blonde seemed to like me.

29
00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:26.000
What 'fuck are you doing?

30
00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:32.600
It was just love.
 Are you dad's little dry ball?

31
00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:37.240
After one such trip you think:

32
00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:44.920
Someone should get up and say: Now we go home!
 - But did we go home?
 !

33
00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:49.600
We go to Slopys!
 Yes!

34
00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:53.640
Slopys!

35
00:03:53.800 --> 00:04:00.040
Were we forced to choose the worst place in the whole city?

36
00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:05.080
You were almost killed by the guard.

37
00:04:05.240 --> 00:04:12.640
I'll solve it for you.
 The girl, the girl, the girl, the girl and five of us.

38
00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:19.080
The gays remain.
 - What 'ere?
 I'm trying to solve this.
 What the hell!

39
00:04:19.240 --> 00:04:24.720
Damn, what a fun evening!
 We have to do that again.

40
00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:35.880
It annoys me that people say: You look much shorter in reality.

41
00:04:36.040 --> 00:04:38.760
People look further on television.

42
00:04:38.920 --> 00:04:42.160
-How tall are you?
 –1.64.

43
00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:44.960
I'm 1.58.

44
00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:48.480
In television you have nothing to compare with -

45
00:04:48.640 --> 00:04:55.640
- But if the person stands next to something you recognize, it will be fair.

46
00:04:55.800 --> 00:04:59.880
If you stand at a matchbox ...

47
00:05:00.040 --> 00:05:03.360
It becomes more fair.

48
00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:07.720
I saw Jan Guillou down in Malmö.

49
00:05:07.880 --> 00:05:12.480
He is much shorter than you think, and wider.

50
00:05:12.640 --> 00:05:17.640
He had red hair and spoke Danish.

51
00:05:17.800 --> 00:05:24.760
And TV puts on a few pounds.
 Peter Harryson is probably not so thick ...

52
00:05:24.920 --> 00:05:27.600
No, it would be sick.

53
00:05:28.520 --> 00:05:34.760
We have received a postcard on trucks set outside a barbecue kiosk -

54
00:05:34.920 --> 00:05:38.600
- From an au pair in Germany.

55
00:05:38.760 --> 00:05:43.360
  Klingelingeling, hier came there eier - man ...

56
00:05:53.920 --> 00:05:58.000
-Who was it?
 –The eier - man.

57
00:05:58.160 --> 00:06:03.240
He comes here every time you say that word.

58
00:06:03.400 --> 00:06:08.840
I can't say the word now because then he dances in again.

59
00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:14.400
Is the word truck?
 Barbecue kiosk?
 Lotta?

60
00:06:14.560 --> 00:06:17.880
- It is the country ... - Germany?

61
00:06:18.040 --> 00:06:22.080
  Klingelingeling, hier came there eier - mann

62
00:06:31.600 --> 00:06:35.240
He is funny!
 Why is he coming?

63
00:06:35.400 --> 00:06:41.560
There was something about it in the rental contract.
 Take the postcard now!

64
00:06:41.720 --> 00:06:47.600
It is from Lotta, who is au pair in Bern, who is in ...

65
00:06:47.760 --> 00:06:50.760
Bern is not located in Germany!

66
00:06:50.920 --> 00:06:53.680
  Klingelingeling ...

67
00:07:04.080 --> 00:07:10.720
Lotta writes: "There is so much crazy stuff in shrimp frozen."

68
00:07:10.880 --> 00:07:14.360
"Where do you get everything from?"

69
00:07:14.520 --> 00:07:18.040
We buy most fun.

70
00:07:18.200 --> 00:07:21.480
Yes, e.g.
 Many Polish jokes.

71
00:07:21.640 --> 00:07:25.600
Cigarettes, vodka!
 Buy!
 Good prices!

72
00:07:25.760 --> 00:07:31.200
- Hi, do you have any jokes?
 - Yes, many fun!
 The joke!

73
00:07:32.400 --> 00:07:36.080
Many fun jokes.
 Everyone laughs!

74
00:07:39.320 --> 00:07:43.680
Party with the ferret Göran ... it feels stolen.

75
00:07:43.840 --> 00:07:48.040
No, it's not stolen!

76
00:07:48.200 --> 00:07:53.400
- Do you have a thunderstorm?
 - No, but zipper!

77
00:07:56.560 --> 00:08:02.200
Okay, we say: The joke - and two loafs the cigarettes on the purchase.

78
00:08:02.360 --> 00:08:06.440
- But we don't smoke.
 - All smoke!

79
00:08:06.600 --> 00:08:12.520
We say: The joke, a loaf of cigarettes - and salami!

80
00:08:16.440 --> 00:08:18.480
Good!

81
00:08:18.640 --> 00:08:24.680
- Two tomatoes that go over a road ... - But the sausage is delicious.

82
00:08:26.480 --> 00:08:34.080
No stupid sausage.
 - 500 bucks for salami, cigarettes and jokes!

83
00:08:35.960 --> 00:08:39.720
The cigarettes, vodka, buy good gift!

84
00:08:40.360 --> 00:08:42.560
Do you have any jokes?

85
00:08:46.080 --> 00:08:50.760
Now we intend to announce a competition -

86
00:08:50.920 --> 00:08:57.440
- And want you to send in your jokes so we perform the most fun contribution.

87
00:08:57.600 --> 00:09:03.240
The ten most fun jokes are rewarded with a bumper sticking.

88
00:09:06.880 --> 00:09:12.760
The most fun joke wins a piece of the Berlin Wall.

89
00:09:12.920 --> 00:09:19.760
But how can viewers be sure it is a piece of genuine Berlin wall?

90
00:09:19.920 --> 00:09:25.520
It comes with Bengt Fahlström's authenticity guarantee.

91
00:09:26.840 --> 00:09:30.160
Bengt Fahlström from Barnjournalen -

92
00:09:30.320 --> 00:09:35.360
- Points on the stone and says: It's genuine!

93
00:09:36.040 --> 00:09:42.040
Send your jokes to us and we will assess the comic quality.

94
00:09:42.200 --> 00:09:47.960
I have a solid background as stand -up comedian -

95
00:09:48.120 --> 00:09:53.840
- And has become a perfectionist when it comes to humor.

96
00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:58.160
I can create magic on a stage.

97
00:09:58.320 --> 00:10:05.880
Thank you.
 - Then it's time for the next program point.
 We're going to change pace.

98
00:10:06.040 --> 00:10:11.640
It's time for the stand -up comedian David.

99
00:10:14.040 --> 00:10:17.160
Fun to see so many people here!

100
00:10:17.320 --> 00:10:21.480
Why do you have socks, really?

101
00:10:21.640 --> 00:10:26.560
Is it like caps for the feet, right?

102
00:10:36.600 --> 00:10:43.200
The timing is the most important thing.
 Without it, the whole comic can be ruined.

103
00:10:43.360 --> 00:10:48.800
The difference between hit and miss is delicate.

104
00:10:48.960 --> 00:10:51.960
On an airplane everything is so small!

105
00:10:52.120 --> 00:10:57.760
On the tray you should put these little bottles.
 I'm just saying: Stick!

106
00:10:57.920 --> 00:11:04.320
The comedian must see things in everyday life that people have not succeeded in formulating.

107
00:11:04.480 --> 00:11:07.600
Why do all Chinese have oblique eyes?

108
00:11:07.760 --> 00:11:12.600
Are they so yellow that they get dazzled?
 - "I have to pee!"

109
00:11:12.760 --> 00:11:18.440
It is not the comedian who will shout when the emperor is naked.

110
00:11:18.600 --> 00:11:21.960
We must criticize the men of power!

111
00:11:22.120 --> 00:11:28.080
But the most important thing is to entertain, to be fun.

112
00:11:28.240 --> 00:11:34.040
There is no better reward than seeing joy in the eyes of the audience.

113
00:11:34.200 --> 00:11:39.800
I may have brightened up their meaningless life.

114
00:11:44.320 --> 00:11:50.120
Last week we asked you to submit your own home video movies.

115
00:11:50.280 --> 00:11:56.920
We have received many dull films and selected four finalists.

116
00:12:04.920 --> 00:12:08.360
Oh, a mouse!
 Where are you going?

117
00:12:09.280 --> 00:12:15.320
Well, a bat!
 Now I got hold of you!
 No, he smeared!

118
00:12:15.480 --> 00:12:18.720
What a disaster!

119
00:12:18.880 --> 00:12:22.720
Now I have you!
 A little wire flavor ...

120
00:12:24.120 --> 00:12:27.080
Where are you going?
 Stay!

121
00:12:29.480 --> 00:12:32.760
-Do you want to play?
 - No, go from here!

122
00:12:32.920 --> 00:12:37.400
You seem to be a strange lazy undulating!

123
00:12:37.560 --> 00:12:42.760
I go up for a while and check.
 No, here was nothing.

124
00:12:42.920 --> 00:12:46.320
-I can not take it.
 - No, stick then.

125
00:12:48.680 --> 00:12:54.360
- Sen to work as usual ... Oh!
 - Should you drive or stand still?

126
00:12:54.520 --> 00:12:59.520
- I drive by.
 I'm in a hurry.
 - Night's car - turn!

127
00:12:59.680 --> 00:13:04.680
I don't know if I'm going to front or back.
 Oh, a bus!

128
00:13:09.560 --> 00:13:15.040
- Here you can't sit.
 Circulate.
 - We are just waiting for the bus.

129
00:13:15.200 --> 00:13:20.640
You ruin my nice hairstyle!
 Oh, leave!
 Stop!

130
00:13:21.160 --> 00:13:26.560
We will select a winner of these four.

131
00:13:26.720 --> 00:13:33.680
The winner we send away to an industrial area outside Bucharest-

132
00:13:33.840 --> 00:13:40.520
- To participate in one of Europe's largest asbestos remediation projects.

133
00:13:40.680 --> 00:13:46.080
The winner is accommodated at Vladislav and Alina.

134
00:13:46.240 --> 00:13:49.280
The winner is allowed to work in rubber factory -

135
00:13:49.440 --> 00:13:54.840
- And maybe taste Vladislav's famous salt sausage.

136
00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:58.400
It's exciting.
 Who can win?

137
00:13:58.560 --> 00:14:01.720
Who is the winner of the weekend trip?

138
00:14:01.880 --> 00:14:07.440
Winners are "strange undulates" of Ulf Buller!

139
00:14:25.560 --> 00:14:30.160
Thank you!
 Wonderfully!

140
00:14:30.320 --> 00:14:35.960
-Congratulations!
 How does it feel?
 - I could hardly believe it!

141
00:14:36.120 --> 00:14:41.480
I didn't understand what I had, but "the government" said:

142
00:14:41.640 --> 00:14:48.240
"Submit this to TV."
 It was just to obey.
 And between us:

143
00:14:48.400 --> 00:14:55.120
I sent the video to the Zick Zack program already a couple of years ago!

144
00:14:55.280 --> 00:14:58.920
But the one waiting for something good ...

145
00:14:59.080 --> 00:15:06.000
If you need a new washing machine or other appliances then come to me!

146
00:15:06.160 --> 00:15:09.160
Uffes cash in Höör!
 Absolutely crazy prices!

147
00:15:09.320 --> 00:15:12.200
Thank you.

148
00:15:12.360 --> 00:15:16.840
I'm happy, because this is showing -

149
00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:23.760
- That with hard work, anyone who is prepared to fight can be something!

150
00:15:23.920 --> 00:15:30.680
You should not think that you can come here and only receive contributions after grants!

151
00:15:30.840 --> 00:15:38.120
Look at America!
 The Indians did not stop immigration in time.

152
00:15:38.280 --> 00:15:41.320
Now they live in celibacy!

153
00:15:41.480 --> 00:15:46.240
You get bus tickets to Romania.
 Nice trip!

154
00:15:52.080 --> 00:15:57.720
Jörgen is a genius in web construction.

155
00:15:57.880 --> 00:16:02.520
- We have known each other for a long time.
 - Sustain to get hold of good people?

156
00:16:02.680 --> 00:16:06.600
You have to have the right "Employ image".

157
00:16:06.760 --> 00:16:09.760
Ulla holds us right.

158
00:16:09.920 --> 00:16:14.200
Here is Göran.
 - We might be able to talk about finances.

159
00:16:14.360 --> 00:16:18.840
- You got to see you about?
 - Yes, then.

160
00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:25.080
Then maybe we can talk some prices.
 Have a seat.

161
00:16:25.240 --> 00:16:31.560
We cannot go below SEK 400 per unit excluding VAT and shipping -

162
00:16:31.720 --> 00:16:36.520
–And a fee of SEK 1,200 per hour.

163
00:16:36.680 --> 00:16:40.600
That price does not pass our budget.

164
00:16:52.800 --> 00:16:57.400
-Hello.
 - "The Crying Game."
 Have you seen it?

165
00:16:57.560 --> 00:17:02.120
- Customer number?
 –4511, I think.

166
00:17:02.280 --> 00:17:05.880
Then it will be SEK 45.

167
00:17:07.680 --> 00:17:12.240
A five -crown back and then the movie.

168
00:17:12.400 --> 00:17:18.360
I think you will be surprised that the good looking black girl is a guy.

169
00:17:18.520 --> 00:17:21.520
Welcome back!

170
00:17:25.960 --> 00:17:31.160
Soon Robert Gustafsson will come, but before that ...

171
00:17:31.320 --> 00:17:37.320
- Don't the egg man come back?
 -No.
 Just if you say the word ...

172
00:17:37.480 --> 00:17:43.360
We welcome our lifestyle consultant Henrik Elmér!

173
00:17:47.520 --> 00:17:53.160
Thanks and welcome to the course "Meet Life with Henrik".

174
00:17:54.320 --> 00:18:01.040
Today we will talk about an increasingly common problem: loneliness.

175
00:18:01.200 --> 00:18:07.760
But many want to pull away from the human community.

176
00:18:07.920 --> 00:18:13.520
They do not want to receive hands that are stretched.

177
00:18:13.680 --> 00:18:20.560
Do you have good cohesion on your page in the telephone directory?

178
00:18:20.720 --> 00:18:24.560
I'm standing on the most boring page!

179
00:18:24.720 --> 00:18:32.240
I sometimes call everyone on the page and want to have a party or go to theater -

180
00:18:32.400 --> 00:18:35.400
- But everyone ignores it.

181
00:18:35.560 --> 00:18:42.520
I call when they turn years and on the telephone directory day that I introduced.

182
00:18:43.920 --> 00:18:49.960
Last time when I turned years, I was awakened by some on my side.

183
00:18:50.120 --> 00:18:56.160
They brought me a gift - a telephone directory with their own page.

184
00:18:58.600 --> 00:19:05.880
Then I got angry, called everyone again and said we had to talk.

185
00:19:06.040 --> 00:19:13.240
I cannot take responsibility alone for our cohesion.

186
00:19:13.400 --> 00:19:16.600
No one of course had time to meet.

187
00:19:16.760 --> 00:19:22.600
Someone would go abroad and someone would go out with people on another side.

188
00:19:22.760 --> 00:19:28.880
A guy had a secret number.
 And we who were almost besties!

189
00:19:29.040 --> 00:19:35.560
It annoys me that people change to secret numbers all the time.

190
00:19:35.720 --> 00:19:42.440
My f.d.
 Girlfriend Gunilla has switched to secret number.
 Why?

191
00:19:42.600 --> 00:19:48.280
I don't like that!
 What do you think?

192
00:19:48.440 --> 00:19:54.160
I can explain why, but then I need some person.

193
00:19:54.320 --> 00:19:58.040
I take the very beautiful woman here.

194
00:19:58.200 --> 00:20:04.440
If you would like to change from ... what kind of phone number do you have now?

195
00:20:04.600 --> 00:20:09.920
Or I can troll a little!
 Do you want to see?

196
00:20:10.080 --> 00:20:13.560
I have a little trick ...

197
00:20:13.720 --> 00:20:19.320
You will probably be surprised if I already have your number.

198
00:20:19.480 --> 00:20:24.120
I'm alone in this in the world.

199
00:20:25.560 --> 00:20:30.800
Do you recognize this?
 Not yours?
 No.

200
00:20:35.440 --> 00:20:42.040
Some time I will encounter a girl who has this number!

201
00:20:42.200 --> 00:20:49.000
The course is about positive thinking and next time you will know more!

202
00:21:19.200 --> 00:21:24.160
What are you doing?
 What 'fuck are you doing?

203
00:21:24.320 --> 00:21:29.920
- You took my money!
 I saw it!
 - No, that's my money.

204
00:21:30.080 --> 00:21:35.720
The vending machine is behind.
 Next time will your money come.

205
00:21:35.880 --> 00:21:38.960
Can I get my money here!

206
00:21:39.120 --> 00:21:42.640
Go to the bank and ask.

207
00:21:42.800 --> 00:21:47.200
Stop it now!
 That's my money!

208
00:21:47.360 --> 00:21:52.600
- Do you want to call the police?
 - No, I took a robber.

209
00:21:52.760 --> 00:21:59.000
I was just a chance.
 If so, it goes.
 You don't take it badly, right?

210
00:21:59.160 --> 00:22:01.800
Yes Yes...

211
00:22:03.640 --> 00:22:08.960
I can't cope with Stefan.
 It gets too much.

212
00:22:09.120 --> 00:22:15.120
- He is worse than the kids in kindergarten.
 - I don't take it up with him.

213
00:22:15.280 --> 00:22:20.920
He might be disturbed in childhood.
 Missing a father figure, maybe.

214
00:22:21.080 --> 00:22:24.720
Broken toys, maybe.

215
00:22:27.920 --> 00:22:33.320
Hi, Stefan.
 Kerstin and I have talked about one thing.

216
00:22:33.480 --> 00:22:39.760
We think you do a good job here and everyone likes you and so ...

217
00:22:40.920 --> 00:22:46.800
But you have to wash better in the kitchenette.
 People get annoyed.

218
00:22:46.960 --> 00:22:53.000
You know how annoying it is when there is no pure stuff.

219
00:22:59.520 --> 00:23:03.440
Now to what everyone has been waiting for!

220
00:23:03.600 --> 00:23:09.720
He has an incredibly "tight" schedule, but here is Robert Gustafsson!

221
00:23:21.200 --> 00:23:27.360
You work as a tiler and have your own company outside Sundbyberg.

222
00:23:27.520 --> 00:23:30.720
Yes, Robert's building.

223
00:23:30.880 --> 00:23:36.920
You worked on the tile expert in Nacka but then started your own.

224
00:23:39.560 --> 00:23:45.400
You put tiles in wet spaces and it is not spectacular -

225
00:23:45.560 --> 00:23:51.160
- But you have also put tiles in different storage areas.

226
00:23:53.720 --> 00:23:57.840
- But that's not why you're here.
 - Joo.

227
00:23:59.840 --> 00:24:07.480
Robert, you are out working a lot and meet new people every day.

228
00:24:07.640 --> 00:24:13.440
There are certainly a lot of pleasures on a regular working day.

229
00:24:13.600 --> 00:24:15.840
No.

230
00:24:16.000 --> 00:24:20.240
- No especially you want to tell us about?
 -No.

231
00:24:22.200 --> 00:24:26.400
You have no Eskimå -Diso in your pants?

232
00:24:27.400 --> 00:24:29.640
Huh?

233
00:24:29.800 --> 00:24:35.200
Maybe they just stoves plates this time.

234
00:24:37.440 --> 00:24:42.600
Robert, a little bird whispered in my ear -

235
00:24:42.760 --> 00:24:48.280
- A couple of years ago you tiled a whole kitchen with Danish tiles.

236
00:24:48.440 --> 00:24:51.640
Danish?
 I would never do that.

237
00:24:53.360 --> 00:24:57.760
- Maybe something you dream about?
 -No.

238
00:25:00.400 --> 00:25:05.520
You are mostly out and parties with your ferret Göran.

239
00:25:05.680 --> 00:25:08.000
Huh?

240
00:25:08.160 --> 00:25:14.320
Robert, once you were in a townhouse in Upplands Väsby and tiled a kitchen.

241
00:25:14.480 --> 00:25:18.200
- Then something happened crazy.
 -Yes.

242
00:25:18.360 --> 00:25:22.480
- You stood on a ladder.
 -Yes.

243
00:25:22.640 --> 00:25:27.840
- Something happened crazy.
 -Yes.

244
00:25:28.000 --> 00:25:32.640
The steps stood against the door, the wife opened the door -

245
00:25:32.800 --> 00:25:37.920
- The steps overturned and you crashed straight straight down the floor.

246
00:25:38.920 --> 00:25:41.960
Tell us about this!

247
00:25:42.120 --> 00:25:45.920
I was in Upplands Väsby and worked.

248
00:25:46.080 --> 00:25:51.520
The wife came home and opened the door that I had set the steps towards.

249
00:25:51.680 --> 00:25:55.480
I fell straight on the kitchen floor.

250
00:25:58.960 --> 00:26:03.160
Robert, I have a bottle of chlorine here.

251
00:26:03.320 --> 00:26:06.840
You can do whatever you want with it.

252
00:26:07.000 --> 00:26:12.600
You may want to taste a little, it will be a fun thing.

253
00:26:16.560 --> 00:26:19.880
Chlorine?

254
00:26:20.040 --> 00:26:23.440
He's talking to hes voice

255
00:26:25.200 --> 00:26:28.760
Thanks, Robert Gustafsson!

256
00:26:33.480 --> 00:26:37.440
We have learned a lot this evening -

257
00:26:37.600 --> 00:26:43.400
-for example.
 Drinking alcohol in moderation, and not saying a special word.

258
00:26:43.560 --> 00:26:45.920
Germany.

259
00:26:46.080 --> 00:26:51.200
  Klingelingeling, hier came there eier - mann

260
00:27:40.600 --> 00:27:42.800
SVT Program Sewing: Birgitta Sunnerdal

261
00:27:44.960 --> 00:27:50.760
- We have bought a fifth with a balcony.
 - I live in a second with a good position.

262
00:27:50.920 --> 00:27:54.920
But I have no balcony ... and the kids?

263
00:27:55.080 --> 00:28:00.080
Josefin goes in second and Isaac in kindergarten ...
