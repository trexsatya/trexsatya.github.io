1
00:00:00,870 --> 00:00:05,560
null

2
00:00:05,810 --> 00:00:07,350
came to change.

3
00:00:08,340 --> 00:00:11,980
We come from 2021 and 2020

4
00:00:12,500 --> 00:00:15,649
Nice years where everything went up.

5
00:00:16,100 --> 00:00:18,550
But in 2022 became one year

6
00:00:18,840 --> 00:00:20,590
that no one could have predicted.

7
00:00:21,960 --> 00:00:26,320
An inflation that went from 0 % to 10 %.

8
00:00:28,340 --> 00:00:31,320
Interest rates that were at minus

9
00:00:31,550 --> 00:00:34,330
as now at 2.5%

10
00:00:34,330 --> 00:00:35,920
mortgage rates

11
00:00:35,960 --> 00:00:37,770
up to 4 percent.

12
00:00:38,500 --> 00:00:43,720
Russia's evil entry, the war in Ukraine.

13
00:00:45,010 --> 00:00:46,990
This and much more.

14
00:00:47,710 --> 00:00:51,170
Got devastating consequences for the stock exchange

15
00:00:51,620 --> 00:00:53,220
is 20 22.

16
00:00:57,040 --> 00:00:59,870
There were many incidents that occurred under 20 22 that

17
00:00:59,880 --> 00:01:01,410
Very few could have predicted.

18
00:01:01,580 --> 00:01:03,860
In this video I want to go through how my

19
00:01:03,870 --> 00:01:05,589
Twenty -sided two have gone there.

20
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:07,740
I will go through my overview at Avanza.

21
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,370
I hope you may have given the fuck in the sales button exactly

22
00:01:11,380 --> 00:01:12,440
As I usually advise,

23
00:01:12,740 --> 00:01:15,870
But there are some exceptions that one must

24
00:01:16,100 --> 00:01:16,690
Pill on it.

25
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:19,890
Whatever you have done, I hope you have health in retaining,

26
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:22,140
After all, that's the most important thing.

27
00:01:32,650 --> 00:01:35,059
So now we jump into my twenty twenty -two

28
00:01:35,390 --> 00:01:38,400
On with the cyclop first we look at the stock exchange at large

29
00:01:38,690 --> 00:01:42,609
how deeply the stock exchange made its deepest dive in a long time

30
00:01:42,810 --> 00:01:46,440
minus fifteen and half percent for o m x thirty

31
00:01:47,190 --> 00:01:51,320
but we look at the wider o m x s p in because o m

32
00:01:51,330 --> 00:01:53,420
x thirty is a pretty narrow index

33
00:01:53,780 --> 00:01:54,440
Then we see

34
00:01:54,590 --> 00:01:57,390
That the stock exchange as a whole went down it is significantly more.

35
00:01:58,340 --> 00:02:00,600
Minus fifteen percent does not sound so dangerous indeed

36
00:02:00,980 --> 00:02:02,910
So what can we learn from previous stock market cases

37
00:02:03,620 --> 00:02:07,570
Large dips are usually followed by even greater upturns

38
00:02:07,880 --> 00:02:11,620
just as we can see is certainly shows this now now it goes

39
00:02:11,630 --> 00:02:14,230
after all from ninety -nine which is quite long

40
00:02:14,860 --> 00:02:17,510
but o m x thirty have gone up six hundred nine percent

41
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:18,190
since

42
00:02:18,460 --> 00:02:22,709
and in these dips so the stock market is usually recovering

43
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:23,380
a lot.

44
00:02:25,010 --> 00:02:25,359
But.

45
00:02:26,079 --> 00:02:28,470
It is not the important thing but the important thing in

46
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:31,429
This video is to go in and check out how it went

47
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:35,959
for me and for me for twenty twenty -two so it went

48
00:02:35,970 --> 00:02:39,570
minus thirty -three come thirty -seven percent

49
00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:43,620
Tough now, to say the least.

50
00:02:44,710 --> 00:02:47,350
But I'm actually pretty happy because I was after all

51
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:49,770
down and touched on minus forty percent

52
00:02:49,940 --> 00:02:53,850
during the year and it managed to recover the portfolio up

53
00:02:53,860 --> 00:02:55,890
to minus thirty -three percent

54
00:02:56,180 --> 00:02:58,890
And it was a bit lucky this I do not know we have after all

55
00:02:58,900 --> 00:03:00,679
a pair of drawbar that has

56
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:04,230
stood for having recovered the portfolio a great deal

57
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:08,710
If you then look at the start, however, we see

58
00:03:08,880 --> 00:03:13,170
that overall, I'm plus just over ninety percent

59
00:03:13,180 --> 00:03:14,390
Since I started investing.

60
00:03:15,710 --> 00:03:18,180
So I don't know how accurate these numbers are,

61
00:03:18,190 --> 00:03:20,559
How correct it is and has a little more money on others

62
00:03:20,570 --> 00:03:22,650
Places too, but it's nice that you

63
00:03:22,660 --> 00:03:23,810
Located plus anyway.

64
00:03:25,490 --> 00:03:28,550
If we move on, we see that compared to others like that

65
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:31,679
I am lower than the average for the year

66
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:35,810
t o m x thirty minus fifteen avanza jane cut minus

67
00:03:35,850 --> 00:03:40,850
twenty -one percent and D J U S A minus twenty percent

68
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:45,049
So that yes a little worse than the incision simply.

69
00:03:46,210 --> 00:03:48,790
And we look at Kronoberg so we see minus two hundred

70
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:51,620
nineteen thousand four hundred four -nyste -two kronor

71
00:03:52,110 --> 00:03:56,299
of which development stands for minus four hundred forty

72
00:03:56,510 --> 00:03:57,500
thousand crowns.

73
00:03:59,860 --> 00:04:01,040
Yes, it's a lot of money,

74
00:04:02,060 --> 00:04:05,350
But I had a pretty good year seen for deposits.

75
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:08,580
I put in the whole two hundred eleven 1000 SEK so that

76
00:04:08,590 --> 00:04:11,450
The total change in value is, as always, doped a whole

77
00:04:11,460 --> 00:04:14,570
part of my deposits dividends actually went up

78
00:04:14,580 --> 00:04:17,700
to the entire elvatus four hundredths sexty -six kronor,

79
00:04:18,060 --> 00:04:19,729
Which is a record for me.

80
00:04:19,740 --> 00:04:22,539
Fun to see that there is actually some money left anyway

81
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:24,860
Despite this shit year

82
00:04:25,380 --> 00:04:27,150
so we may hope that it will be better next year

83
00:04:27,460 --> 00:04:30,710
And we look at my purchases and sell here and then we see that three hundred and thirty,

84
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:34,870
Five thousand one hundred and eighty dollars I bought for and 100 fourteen thousand,

85
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:37,220
I sold nine hundred and fifty kronor.

86
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:43,070
This is how it traded in January, so I bought as absolutely the most

87
00:04:43,140 --> 00:04:45,349
And since then it has been so that I have had a whole

88
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:48,630
Part of cash during the year that I have put in and invested.

89
00:04:48,640 --> 00:04:51,890
And I have also started investing in my business account,

90
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:54,170
which is separated from my private.

91
00:04:54,180 --> 00:04:56,620
But these are entered in these figures then

92
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:02,400
and my sales were in April and June and November at its greatest

93
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:03,630
in April.

94
00:05:03,640 --> 00:05:06,469
Then I see that I sold for 83 three thousand kronor,

95
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:09,460
Which I can suspect has to do with Sinch.

96
00:05:11,170 --> 00:05:13,169
If we go on, we see exactly

97
00:05:13,350 --> 00:05:15,880
Investor was the ones I bought most in.

98
00:05:15,890 --> 00:05:18,539
I have invested a great deal in Investor this year

99
00:05:18,590 --> 00:05:23,080
and I have sold since for fifty -thumb three hundreds

100
00:05:23,270 --> 00:05:24,450
in the beginning of the year.

101
00:05:27,490 --> 00:05:30,160
If we move on, we see we have the most you invest 12

102
00:05:30,170 --> 00:05:33,180
months in line and so many months you bought something 12

103
00:05:33,190 --> 00:05:34,580
months so 12 out of 12.

104
00:05:34,590 --> 00:05:35,539
It's cruel.

105
00:05:35,610 --> 00:05:38,620
That's exactly what I usually tell you about

106
00:05:38,630 --> 00:05:40,840
continue to invest all the time regardless of whether it is

107
00:05:40,850 --> 00:05:42,320
shaky or not

108
00:05:42,870 --> 00:05:45,640
and now we get into individual holdings here so see

109
00:05:45,650 --> 00:05:49,260
We best and worst securities during the year.

110
00:05:49,270 --> 00:05:52,479
Twenty -sided two so we see that hexatronic die for plus

111
00:05:52,490 --> 00:05:53,770
Forty -five thousand kronor

112
00:05:54,070 --> 00:05:57,719
Waystream plus thirty -few thousand kronor and savlend for

113
00:05:57,730 --> 00:06:01,440
one thousand -two hundred crowns so very nice to have 3

114
00:06:01,450 --> 00:06:04,020
Pieces of holdings that have actually gone well and these

115
00:06:04,180 --> 00:06:07,510
The shares I actually went through in my video about my 3

116
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:08,190
Best shares.

117
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:10,790
Twenty -sided two so check it out if you haven't seen it

118
00:06:11,040 --> 00:06:13,150
Because there I go through this company gives little

119
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:15,159
elevator spitch and so there talks a little what I think and think

120
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:16,710
The 3 worst

121
00:06:17,100 --> 00:06:20,650
that is the largest drawbar that pushed down the portfolio

122
00:06:20,660 --> 00:06:25,010
During the year, Sinch is for minus one hundred and eighty thousand kronor

123
00:06:25,230 --> 00:06:27,669
Play SEK 89,000.

124
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:30,180
And Castellum minus eighty thousand kronor.

125
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:33,070
Juicy sums there so really

126
00:06:33,690 --> 00:06:37,280
And now we'll see what the countries look like you have the most

127
00:06:37,290 --> 00:06:41,219
Money invested in Sweden about ninety percent

128
00:06:41,610 --> 00:06:44,920
a little u s a and then a little other in scattered then

129
00:06:45,090 --> 00:06:46,800
and now we get into funds

130
00:06:47,290 --> 00:06:50,640
What do we have on funds then yes we see the companies that are most

131
00:06:50,650 --> 00:06:51,810
Owned in the funds

132
00:06:52,110 --> 00:06:55,190
Investor that I invested a great deal in Industrivärden

133
00:06:55,200 --> 00:06:56,780
Lundbergs Kinnevik and Hexagon

134
00:06:56,950 --> 00:06:58,860
I suspect this is because I have a very

135
00:06:58,870 --> 00:07:00,960
Big thing in Spiltan investment company.

136
00:07:01,460 --> 00:07:02,849
As these companies are in.

137
00:07:04,230 --> 00:07:06,880
Durability value better than the incision o k fun

138
00:07:07,980 --> 00:07:10,690
now and the funds that have the best sustainability value are then

139
00:07:10,700 --> 00:07:13,610
Spiltan Investment Company Plus Real Estate and Avanza

140
00:07:13,620 --> 00:07:14,710
Sweden fun.

141
00:07:16,770 --> 00:07:19,430
So thank you for this year, they say now.

142
00:07:20,120 --> 00:07:23,219
So my avanza overview minus thirty -three percent

143
00:07:23,330 --> 00:07:26,700
Two hundred ninety -thousand SEK in value change excluding

144
00:07:26,710 --> 00:07:27,550
Deposits then

145
00:07:27,750 --> 00:07:31,890
Best Month July Best Share Hexatronic Cronimet

146
00:07:32,330 --> 00:07:34,849
yes that was the year it was tough to see

147
00:07:35,530 --> 00:07:39,239
But then it is, after all, we have to have a little downturn before

148
00:07:39,250 --> 00:07:40,270
Breaths too

149
00:07:40,630 --> 00:07:42,980
As one usually says after rain comes sunshine and after

150
00:07:42,990 --> 00:07:44,020
Sunshine comes rain

151
00:07:44,210 --> 00:07:47,369
so that after the rise we must have a small slowdown sometimes

152
00:07:47,630 --> 00:07:50,140
And that's probably what we get to know what we'll see well

153
00:07:50,150 --> 00:07:52,610
How it will be during twenty -threatening.

154
00:07:53,010 --> 00:07:55,340
I think it might be going on

155
00:07:55,350 --> 00:07:56,609
shaky this year,

156
00:07:56,909 --> 00:07:59,750
but hopefully we will get

157
00:07:59,990 --> 00:08:03,430
a little recovery in perhaps the last half of the year

158
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:04,590
Hope I at

159
00:08:04,790 --> 00:08:09,030
maybe that inflation begins to come down a little neighbor and

160
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:11,200
That you do not have to raise interest rates so much.

161
00:08:11,210 --> 00:08:12,140
It may probably give

162
00:08:12,390 --> 00:08:15,940
A small spark for the stock exchange to recover, I think.

163
00:08:16,210 --> 00:08:18,620
How did it go for you under twenty -twenty -two write?

164
00:08:18,630 --> 00:08:21,500
Great this below and I really want to know

165
00:08:21,510 --> 00:08:25,000
If you have any tips on more videos that you think I

166
00:08:25,010 --> 00:08:27,590
will do wonders for the year, twenty -twenty

167
00:08:27,760 --> 00:08:30,390
hopefully so the year will go better than it

168
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:33,730
did last year, but now don't forget that

169
00:08:33,820 --> 00:08:35,870
Continue investing all the time.

170
00:08:35,880 --> 00:08:38,289
Ongoing, continued to invest in funds

171
00:08:38,480 --> 00:08:41,250
shares.
 And is it that you are not comfortable so to run a

172
00:08:41,260 --> 00:08:44,010
Monthly savings constantly saves a little neighbor?

173
00:08:44,179 --> 00:08:46,990
Make sure you don't pull down on your savings even if you

174
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:50,640
gets tougher times this year so always have some savings

175
00:08:50,820 --> 00:08:54,570
running after because when it goes down, it buys after all

176
00:08:54,580 --> 00:08:56,900
Cheaper to get more share for money.

177
00:08:57,100 --> 00:08:59,090
So it is important that you continue to save

178
