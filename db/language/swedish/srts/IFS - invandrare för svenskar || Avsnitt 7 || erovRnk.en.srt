Paludan's Sugardaddy Chang Frick.

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:28.200
Humor Sweden's Yao Ming, Evelyn Mok.

8
00:00:28.360 --> 00:00:30.960
Jalla, that's MFB's Musti Jaralla.

9
00:00:31.120 --> 00:00:34.000
And the whole of Sweden's TV4-Brasse, Tilde de Paula.

10
00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:38.960
As always, the punchline profile with style, host Ahmed Berhan!

11
00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:42.000
What happens, good people.
 Welcome to IFS.

12
00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:46.120
The only program that is more explosive than a staircase in any suburb.

13
00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:49.080
My name is Ahmed Berhan, I am your host.

14
00:00:49.240 --> 00:00:52.400
Here, my ladies and gentlemen, are the contestants:

15
00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:56.160
Most recently we have Rosa Pantern from Älvsjö, Christina.

16
00:00:56.320 --> 00:01:01.240
Next to her: Repps green, because he is nice.
 Oskar!

17
00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:04.360
Farthest in Orange Ring corner, pound for pound -

18
00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:08.360
- Sweden's best librarian: Annika!

19
00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:13.920
Christina, which panelist do you choose to start tonight's performance with?

20
00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:19.440
- I choose Tilde.
 -Tilde!
 This is your question.

21
00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:31.200
It is probably roughly the equivalent of the Swedish ...

22
00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:35.640
"No. Maybe you would think about the chorus."

23
00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:38.760
A little nicer way to say:

24
00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:45.280
Now this coffee hour, date or evening is over.

25
00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:50.680
Interesting.
 I didn't think Tilde would lie the first thing she does.

26
00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:53.240
But that's false.

27
00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:59.320
Christina came full in Loaded.
 - You think Tilde is lying.

28
00:01:59.480 --> 00:02:03.760
Congratulations, Christina!
 You've received a point.

29
00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:09.040
False.
 The aunt is about to predict your future -

30
00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:15.360
- Gee answers about your love life, future riches ... Turkish voodoo amanah.

31
00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:18.600
Oskar, who do you choose to chew with?

32
00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:21.280
I take the young foal, VC Barre.

33
00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:27.160
Whether, welcome.
 We are fat happy that you are with.
 Heavy you are.
 Question:

34
00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:38.640
He usually uses lots of spices, maybe a little sweaty hairs ...

35
00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:45.560
Just kidding.
 He usually uses yogurt, sriracha, spices ...

36
00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:49.720
Fanta.
 It doesn't have to be Fanta.

37
00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:54.840
It can be any orange soda.
 Zingo also works.

38
00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:01.040
Even the black skulls: "huh?"

39
00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:07.480
What do you say, Oskar?
 Have you tasted the kebab sauce in southern Sweden?

40
00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:13.320
-I have.
 It does not taste zingo.
 - But it's the best, right?

41
00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:20.320
I think VC is drawing a lie.
 I think he is lying.

42
00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:24.920
- Unfortunately, Oskar.
 -No!

43
00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:28.480
There will be no point for you.
 He absolutely does not lie.

44
00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:31.720
They have Fanta in their kebab sauce.

45
00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:40.680
Better luck next time.
 - Annika?

46
00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:44.920
- I choose Chang.
 - Chang.

47
00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:54.920
They would stop begging and become enterprising -

48
00:03:55.080 --> 00:03:57.760
- And got money to start a limited company.

49
00:03:57.920 --> 00:04:03.880
A good investment.
 The state got everything back through the Jack Vegas machines.

50
00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:09.480
The audience is so racist that they: "Is this true?"

51
00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:14.400
The point is that you wanted to get Roma to start a business and get started.

52
00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:19.000
A type Start own contribution.
 You got 30,000 per skull.

53
00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:24.680
- No, I don't think they would ... - that Roma can run a business?

54
00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:30.360
Yes.
 But the state did not distribute money to start a business.

55
00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:35.480
-What are you saying?
 True or false?
 - False.

56
00:04:35.640 --> 00:04:40.720
Congratulations, Annika.
 One point!
 What Chang said was false.

57
00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:45.480
It was a damages due to the illegal Rome register of Skåne Police.

58
00:04:45.640 --> 00:04:51.440
4,700 children and adults were in it and had the right to seek damages.

59
00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:56.000
Do you know what I call it?
 Genealogy.

60
00:04:56.160 --> 00:05:01.040
- Did you get damages?
 -No.
 They hustled me, those bastards.

61
00:05:01.200 --> 00:05:05.840
Truth.
 I got, Ahmed Taikon.
 What happens, BRE?

62
00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:10.520
-Let's move on.
 - Christina?
 -Yes.

63
00:05:10.680 --> 00:05:15.480
- I move on with Evelyn.
 –Evelyn?

64
00:05:23.320 --> 00:05:27.360
So she could eat in bed.

65
00:05:28.840 --> 00:05:32.080
Nobody Else?
 Just me?

66
00:05:33.120 --> 00:05:39.840
This doctor was one who performed innocence operations -

67
00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:45.040
- What is operations to restore the retina -

68
00:05:45.200 --> 00:05:47.880
- Which really does not exist.

69
00:05:48.040 --> 00:05:53.080
He would perform an operation, but had to set up at the last moment.

70
00:05:53.240 --> 00:05:59.440
He then gave the woman the advice to put in chicken liver in the snippan -

71
00:05:59.600 --> 00:06:04.000
-So, once she lay with her husband on their first night -

72
00:06:04.160 --> 00:06:07.120
- She was bleeding anyway.

73
00:06:07.280 --> 00:06:11.520
–When Keeping it Real goes Wrong.
 - It sounded so sick ...

74
00:06:14.720 --> 00:06:17.280
... so it's true.

75
00:06:17.440 --> 00:06:19.640
- You think it's true?
 -Yes.

76
00:06:19.800 --> 00:06:24.560
Doctors in Sweden recommend stopping a chicken liver.

77
00:06:24.720 --> 00:06:30.200
Throughout Evelyn's explanation, I saw how Barre became a vegetarian.

78
00:06:31.440 --> 00:06:34.760
Christina, congratulations to your second score.

79
00:06:37.240 --> 00:06:42.960
It's true.
 It came out when SVT examined innocence operations.

80
00:06:43.120 --> 00:06:46.960
10–44 salmon can be paid for something that was never there.

81
00:06:47.120 --> 00:06:52.240
–Oskar, your turn.
 Who do you choose?
 - I take Elaf.

82
00:06:52.400 --> 00:06:55.520
I like we went to the same hairdresser.

83
00:06:55.680 --> 00:07:01.280
The stylist there can only do one thing.
 She just: "Ball on everyone."
 - Elaf?

84
00:07:06.080 --> 00:07:12.000
If you thought that Ahmed Fes just, then you might agree with the Kurds.

85
00:07:12.160 --> 00:07:17.000
These are actually the words for bargains and fish.

86
00:07:17.160 --> 00:07:21.680
It comes from the Kurds finding that the fish sounds sound so.

87
00:07:21.840 --> 00:07:26.080
You sound like my son in six months.

88
00:07:26.240 --> 00:07:31.840
He may mimic the bargain sound, but I don't think that's right.
 You're lying.

89
00:07:33.960 --> 00:07:35.960
-No!
 - Unfortunately, Oskar.

90
00:07:36.120 --> 00:07:40.440
No point for you this time.
 It's crushed box.

91
00:07:40.600 --> 00:07:44.880
Never been so much Svennebanan in my entire life.

92
00:07:45.040 --> 00:07:51.080
FECE and TEAR are definitely FIS and bargain in Kurdish.

93
00:07:52.840 --> 00:07:56.480
Annika, we move on.
 Who do you choose to talk to?

94
00:07:56.640 --> 00:07:59.240
-Thanos.
 - What happens, Ahmed?

95
00:07:59.400 --> 00:08:01.600
Time for a picture question.

96
00:08:04.800 --> 00:08:10.120
This is a childhood image on Thanos when he was a pimp in Botkyrka -93.

97
00:08:10.920 --> 00:08:15.040
We see this boy from Turkey celebrating a ceremony for several days -

98
00:08:15.200 --> 00:08:17.720
-Do to dress up for prince.

99
00:08:19.640 --> 00:08:23.440
He has inherited his first sausage kiosk.

100
00:08:27.640 --> 00:08:32.160
No, but ... this is from a Turkish custom.

101
00:08:32.320 --> 00:08:36.720
It is such a thing that you cannot translate directly into Swedish.

102
00:08:36.880 --> 00:08:39.680
But it is a type of injunction -

103
00:08:39.840 --> 00:08:43.920
- Where the parents introduce each child.

104
00:08:44.080 --> 00:08:49.000
It is not "engagements for children", but the families will get to know each other.

105
00:08:49.160 --> 00:08:54.120
In case they click as they pass their teens, they will get married.

106
00:08:54.280 --> 00:08:57.760
The custom is called Sujuk in Turkish.

107
00:09:00.120 --> 00:09:04.520
What do you say about this engagement party à la junior?

108
00:09:04.680 --> 00:09:07.880
I have a hard time believing in it.

109
00:09:08.040 --> 00:09:12.160
-I understand.
 - With that suit and such.

110
00:09:12.320 --> 00:09:16.120
Check out, he looks like a suky.
 It's true!

111
00:09:16.280 --> 00:09:20.120
- No, I probably don't think so.
 - You don't think so?

112
00:09:20.280 --> 00:09:24.880
You do that right in. Congratulations to another point, Annika.

113
00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:33.320
The boy celebrates his circumcision which is considered the first step towards becoming a man.

114
00:09:33.480 --> 00:09:35.400
/Grunts/

115
00:09:35.560 --> 00:09:39.960
As you say in Swedish: "No hat indoors."

116
00:09:41.320 --> 00:09:46.480
Wait!
 Pause!
 Do you celebrate circumcision if you look like that?

117
00:09:46.640 --> 00:09:50.640
What did I get?
 An ax was picked up in the living room.

118
00:09:50.800 --> 00:09:53.600
The brother, you are not Turk.

119
00:09:53.760 --> 00:09:56.960
I want to be Turk now.
 Check out how he looks!
 Powerful.

120
00:09:57.120 --> 00:10:01.160
- It actually stands 2–2 ... --... 0.

121
00:10:01.320 --> 00:10:06.600
- How does it feel, Oskar?
 - Swenway in cubic.
 Feels canon.

122
00:10:06.760 --> 00:10:09.880
- Do you like pickled herring?
 - No, I'm a vegetarian.

123
00:10:10.040 --> 00:10:13.040
I do.
 I'm the Swede here.

124
00:10:14.480 --> 00:10:19.480
Christina, can you keep up the success and get a third point?

125
00:10:19.640 --> 00:10:24.080
- What do you trust?
 - Not on anyone.

126
00:10:24.240 --> 00:10:27.200
- Musti delivers so I answer correctly.
 - Musti?

127
00:10:32.160 --> 00:10:37.480
The first thing I think about is that it is SD that demonstrates for BLM.

128
00:10:37.640 --> 00:10:41.680
For real, Christina.
 I'll give you a point.

129
00:10:41.840 --> 00:10:46.000
What you see is a Persian New Year's plot -

130
00:10:46.160 --> 00:10:50.280
–As during the holiday Norouz and spread joy -

131
00:10:50.440 --> 00:10:53.680
- As Santa Claus, but I call him Black Claus.

132
00:10:53.840 --> 00:10:57.720
They look happy.
 Type.

133
00:10:59.720 --> 00:11:04.320
- Do you think that Musti is lying?
 - I think he is lying.

134
00:11:04.480 --> 00:11:08.720
Unfortunately, there will be no point.
 It's true.

135
00:11:08.880 --> 00:11:12.160
The racist Black Face character is called Haji Firuz-

136
00:11:12.320 --> 00:11:15.600
- And has a similar origin as Dutch Zwarte Piet.

137
00:11:15.760 --> 00:11:19.640
A slave boy who will cheer up his master's mood.

138
00:11:19.800 --> 00:11:23.480
In Iran you do it during the New Year, and in the Netherlands during Christmas.

139
00:11:23.640 --> 00:11:28.280
To all Iranians out there who say: "He has only soot in the face" ...

140
00:11:28.440 --> 00:11:31.400
Khafe Sho!

141
00:11:31.560 --> 00:11:34.160
Don't lie to us.

142
00:11:34.320 --> 00:11:39.680
The Dutch tried with it too.
 - Oskar, we move on with you.

143
00:11:39.840 --> 00:11:43.800
You still have no points.
 Who are you running on?

144
00:11:43.960 --> 00:11:47.760
- Yes ... - Felicia, help me out.
 -Yes.

145
00:11:47.920 --> 00:11:51.480
The influencer Rebecca Stella was a snack ice cream 2020.

146
00:11:53.640 --> 00:11:57.760
She did something talented for once.
 Just kidding!

147
00:11:57.920 --> 00:12:01.120
Never Happened.

148
00:12:01.280 --> 00:12:07.520
She explained why she does not have dark colors in her makeup collection.

149
00:12:07.680 --> 00:12:13.480
Why she just has bright colors.
 Because blacks do not buy makeup.

150
00:12:13.640 --> 00:12:19.920
I like clouting glass panes, but, yes ... you speak the truth.

151
00:12:20.080 --> 00:12:26.160
Of all you trusted Felicia.
 Courageously!
 Congratulations to your first point, Oskar.

152
00:12:27.800 --> 00:12:31.920
Felicia did not lie.
 She would advertise her makeup.

153
00:12:32.080 --> 00:12:35.680
A follower wondered why she just sold bright concealers.

154
00:12:35.840 --> 00:12:41.200
Rebecca Stella replied: "The truth is that dark colors barely sell."

155
00:12:41.360 --> 00:12:45.560
Can be because Rebecca uses all the dark colors itself.

156
00:12:47.320 --> 00:12:52.640
Annika, you have a question left.
 But all panelists are already chosen.

157
00:12:52.800 --> 00:12:56.560
Therefore, your panelist will be ...

158
00:13:07.440 --> 00:13:09.520
Chang?

159
00:13:09.680 --> 00:13:14.680
Harald Edelstam, black carnation, a well -known name for Swedish chile.

160
00:13:14.840 --> 00:13:16.520
Por Que?

161
00:13:17.880 --> 00:13:24.520
He was a traveler down in Chile and sniffed a lot.

162
00:13:24.680 --> 00:13:31.040
His own snuff tasted carnation.
 Down there he was called the black carnation.

163
00:13:31.200 --> 00:13:35.040
Many Chileans began to sniff this snuff.

164
00:13:35.200 --> 00:13:40.440
Outside the Nordic countries, Chile is funny enough the country that buys the most snuff.

165
00:13:40.600 --> 00:13:43.680
No!
 So it was not.

166
00:13:43.840 --> 00:13:49.200
- Normally seen a sniffing chiler?
 - It wasn't what it was about.

167
00:13:50.440 --> 00:13:53.760
She doesn't trust anything.

168
00:13:56.400 --> 00:14:01.560
What did I tell you?
 Pound for Pound, Sweden's best librarian.

169
00:14:01.720 --> 00:14:07.800
- Why don't you believe in Chang?
 - He was well ambassador to Chile.

170
00:14:07.960 --> 00:14:11.320
Yes, he spread snus to people.

171
00:14:11.480 --> 00:14:16.840
Congratulations to your third point.
 Full pot in the first round.

172
00:14:17.800 --> 00:14:21.800
What Chang said was false.
 Harald Edelstam or black carnation -

173
00:14:21.960 --> 00:14:24.440
-Was Sweden's ambassador to Chile in the 70s.

174
00:14:24.600 --> 00:14:29.160
He saved hundreds from the violence of the military dictatorship, a bit like Schindler.

175
00:14:29.320 --> 00:14:34.840
It rounds off the first round.
 Christina and Annika go to the final.

176
00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:39.160
Thank you, Oskar, who has competed and competed.

177
00:14:44.520 --> 00:14:49.160
It's time for the final round.
 It's just like the first round -

178
00:14:49.320 --> 00:14:54.360
- In addition if you answer wrong, that point goes over to Annika.

179
00:14:54.520 --> 00:14:56.640
It is only about five.

180
00:14:56.800 --> 00:15:01.200
We start with the one who got a full pot in the first round: Annika.

181
00:15:01.360 --> 00:15:06.200
I heard that you had learned some suburban hose.

182
00:15:06.360 --> 00:15:10.880
-What have you learned?
 --Walla.
 /Pronounces that as Voilá/

183
00:15:15.360 --> 00:15:19.800
I have to hear about that.
 Say it one more time.

184
00:15:19.960 --> 00:15:25.040
--Walla.
 / Voilá/ –Anika, who do you choose?

185
00:15:25.200 --> 00:15:29.480
–Evelyn.
 - Voilá, Annika.
 Walla.

186
00:15:29.640 --> 00:15:34.120
The worst is that Annika uses Walla better than you do.

187
00:15:34.280 --> 00:15:36.040
Evelyn?

188
00:15:39.320 --> 00:15:42.000
That's how they make their sauerkraut.

189
00:15:43.440 --> 00:15:48.440
No, but that means that if it is a Croatian couple ...

190
00:15:48.600 --> 00:15:52.080
... and they try to have children, and that's hard -

191
00:15:52.240 --> 00:15:56.360
-As one of the traditions, a superstition -

192
00:15:56.520 --> 00:16:03.040
- That you put cabbage on your feet to help fertility.

193
00:16:03.200 --> 00:16:05.840
Say Walla.

194
00:16:08.040 --> 00:16:11.440
No I do not think so.

195
00:16:11.600 --> 00:16:17.080
Congratulations to the first point in the final round, Annika.

196
00:16:17.240 --> 00:16:22.920
It's false.
 Cabbage on the feet is considered to reduce swelling and heal wounds.

197
00:16:23.080 --> 00:16:26.080
According to Balkan Morsas.
 - Christina, who do you take?

198
00:16:26.240 --> 00:16:30.840
I think my son Benjamin knows who VC Barre is.

199
00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:33.840
- I honor him and take you.
 -Brother?

200
00:16:37.960 --> 00:16:44.880
In Spain, it is a tradition among young people to yeah, have sex, at twelve.

201
00:16:45.040 --> 00:16:48.360
-Have!
 - I just like it.

202
00:16:49.560 --> 00:16:52.000
Have!

203
00:16:54.200 --> 00:17:00.040
Twelve grapes should be printed at twelve.

204
00:17:00.200 --> 00:17:06.000
Then you have to print one in yourself every time the church bell strikes.

205
00:17:06.160 --> 00:17:11.360
It is said that you are lucky that year, if you have done so.

206
00:17:11.520 --> 00:17:18.320
The only thing I heard was yeah, printing, sex, intercourse.
 What happens, Bram?

207
00:17:18.480 --> 00:17:24.080
I wish Annika came here.
 She could walk.
 Now she can yeah too.

208
00:17:24.240 --> 00:17:27.720
- Christina?
 - I've heard something about the grapes.

209
00:17:27.880 --> 00:17:33.760
But Spain?
 I hang a lot there.
 I have not printed grapes there.

210
00:17:33.920 --> 00:17:38.640
But I believe in you, because it sounds so strange.

211
00:17:38.800 --> 00:17:44.040
It doesn't sound stranger than saying "pressing grapes".

212
00:17:44.200 --> 00:17:47.240
-What do you think?
 True or false?
 - Sant.

213
00:17:47.400 --> 00:17:52.320
You think that's true?
 Congratulations, Christina, you have received a point!

214
00:17:52.480 --> 00:17:54.560
YES!

215
00:17:54.720 --> 00:17:58.480
In Spain, twelve grapes should be printed at midnight.

216
00:17:58.640 --> 00:18:03.280
One every time the church bell is squeezed, to get lucky for the new year.

217
00:18:03.440 --> 00:18:06.760
- Annika, ready to take this on?
 - Yeah.

218
00:18:06.920 --> 00:18:10.200
- What do you choose?
 - Felicia.

219
00:18:14.680 --> 00:18:20.400
She makes jazz hands.
 She is a sick big Broadway fan, if you didn't know.

220
00:18:20.560 --> 00:18:22.520
I was just joking.

221
00:18:22.680 --> 00:18:26.640
She makes a butterfly because she has a butterfly tattooed in the swan.

222
00:18:26.800 --> 00:18:31.880
It is a protest that players are not allowed to take off the sweater when they score goals.

223
00:18:32.040 --> 00:18:34.360
That's why she does so.

224
00:18:35.760 --> 00:18:40.040
I do not think so.
 I do not think so.

225
00:18:40.200 --> 00:18:44.600
- You don't believe in Felicia's explanation?
 - Butterfly!

226
00:18:44.760 --> 00:18:49.920
Annika knows that if you have a butterfly on the flank you will not show it.

227
00:18:50.080 --> 00:18:55.280
- It's actually true.
 - Congratulations to your other points!

228
00:18:55.440 --> 00:18:58.680
You are quick.
 I have to say that.

229
00:18:58.840 --> 00:19:04.680
Kosovare Asllani makes the Albanian eagle as you can see on the Albanian flag.

230
00:19:04.840 --> 00:19:07.720
Let's move on.
 - Christina, your turn.

231
00:19:07.880 --> 00:19:12.080
I know that Elaf has the nicest shoes I have seen, so I choose her.

232
00:19:12.240 --> 00:19:15.960
- Should I show them?
 -Yes thank you.

233
00:19:17.160 --> 00:19:19.280
-Elaf?
 –Yes.

234
00:19:19.440 --> 00:19:21.400
Another image question.

235
00:19:27.520 --> 00:19:31.920
Yes, one of these four is sacred.

236
00:19:32.080 --> 00:19:36.920
It is actually the multivitamin juice.

237
00:19:37.080 --> 00:19:42.640
The resort loves it.
 Do not know why.
 Maybe because it's so cheap.

238
00:19:42.800 --> 00:19:46.880
You get all your vitamins with a glass.

239
00:19:47.040 --> 00:19:51.200
Therefore, everyone is so long.
 Check, Ahmed.

240
00:19:56.800 --> 00:20:02.360
Eh ... my best friend is Turk so we drink the ayran a lot.

241
00:20:02.520 --> 00:20:06.080
Do you say that?

242
00:20:06.240 --> 00:20:10.200
I say it was false, despite stylish shoes.

243
00:20:11.200 --> 00:20:16.640
You say it's false?
 Unfortunately, there will be no point for you.

244
00:20:16.800 --> 00:20:20.600
- But a point to Annika.
 - Shit too!

245
00:20:21.920 --> 00:20:25.160
One thing was fun.
 When Elaf said multivitamin-

246
00:20:25.320 --> 00:20:30.560
- I heard a person in the audience there who started applauding.

247
00:20:30.720 --> 00:20:34.400
The correct answer is Glockengold multivitamin, a very cute juice -

248
00:20:34.560 --> 00:20:40.840
- With dyes in which contains a little, a little ... no vitamins at all.

249
00:20:41.000 --> 00:20:45.360
Congratulations to the bonus points, Annika.
 Who do you choose?

250
00:20:45.520 --> 00:20:48.440
-Tilde.
 - Brazil!
 Brazil!

251
00:20:52.760 --> 00:20:57.280
Annika, the special thing about these three countries is ...

252
00:20:57.440 --> 00:21:02.240
At all IKEA they sell Swedish food - meatballs and everything possible.

253
00:21:02.400 --> 00:21:08.480
In the three countries, most Kalles caviar are eaten, except in Sweden.

254
00:21:08.640 --> 00:21:14.640
But I have bonus information.
 I have lived in ... Portuguese: Brasil.

255
00:21:14.800 --> 00:21:17.640
-E Você Também Fala Português?
 - Fala Fala Nada.

256
00:21:17.800 --> 00:21:20.800
Então Você Sabe Que Isso é a Verdade, Né?

257
00:21:20.960 --> 00:21:23.000
This will be fun.

258
00:21:32.440 --> 00:21:37.240
- That the Swedish queen, Silvia, is half -breeze.

259
00:21:37.400 --> 00:21:42.360
I have lived in Brazil and they always ask: Você Conhece a Rainha?

260
00:21:42.520 --> 00:21:45.760
So: Do you know the queen?

261
00:21:45.920 --> 00:21:51.520
Therefore, it is not called Kalles Caviar in Brazil, but Rainha Silvia.

262
00:21:51.680 --> 00:21:55.640
It is a picture of the tube on our queen.

263
00:22:00.720 --> 00:22:05.280
- Wasn't it fun?
 -Yes.
 Hope that is true only.

264
00:22:05.440 --> 00:22:09.760
-No.
 They probably don't like caviar.
 -You Break My Heart.

265
00:22:09.920 --> 00:22:12.560
Meu Coração!

266
00:22:12.720 --> 00:22:16.160
It sounds like Ronaldinho when you close your eyes.

267
00:22:16.320 --> 00:22:18.640
She has him on the inside.

268
00:22:18.800 --> 00:22:22.240
Why can't caviar be one of our biggest exports?

269
00:22:22.400 --> 00:22:27.320
- I don't think people like caviar.
 -You are absolutely right.
 Congratulations.

270
00:22:30.640 --> 00:22:34.040
People don't like caviar, Kalle.

271
00:22:34.200 --> 00:22:39.600
False.
 All of those countries use the Swedish combat plane Jas Gripen.

272
00:22:39.760 --> 00:22:43.320
We give an applause to Annika because she got another point.

273
00:22:43.480 --> 00:22:50.200
Christina, if you look at the result it stands 4-1 to Annika.

274
00:22:50.360 --> 00:22:54.200
If you answer wrong, Annika has won the whole thing.

275
00:22:54.360 --> 00:22:59.280
- I tag now uphill.
 -I believe in you.
 Who do you choose?

276
00:22:59.440 --> 00:23:03.760
Thanos was chopped, so we choose him.

277
00:23:03.920 --> 00:23:07.480
Which plant ended up being grown in Sweden in the 16th century ...

278
00:23:11.880 --> 00:23:14.640
Feels like you have the answer.

279
00:23:14.800 --> 00:23:20.200
I say this, but not because I'm Greek.
 It was garlic.

280
00:23:20.360 --> 00:23:23.600
That's it.

281
00:23:23.760 --> 00:23:26.920
- No more expenses?
 - Should I sound like a Greek guy?

282
00:23:27.080 --> 00:23:32.280
It was garlic, it came in the 70s with labor immigration and ...

283
00:23:32.440 --> 00:23:36.320
I have to put this one.
 You want an answer.

284
00:23:36.480 --> 00:23:39.480
What are you saying?
 True or false?

285
00:23:39.640 --> 00:23:44.080
-Comeback?
 True.
 - You think it was true?

286
00:23:44.240 --> 00:23:49.320
The game continues, my ladies and gentlemen.
 - Congratulations, Christina!

287
00:23:49.480 --> 00:23:54.600
True.
 For a long time in the 20th century, garlic was only available at Apoteket-

288
00:23:54.760 --> 00:23:57.880
- And was almost forgotten in cooking.

289
00:23:58.040 --> 00:24:02.280
But then the Turks came, they put it in Tzatzki.

290
00:24:03.640 --> 00:24:07.240
Annika, now it's your turn.

291
00:24:07.400 --> 00:24:12.120
If you answer correctly, take this home.
 Are you ready?

292
00:24:12.280 --> 00:24:16.040
I see that library brain just "Frrr".

293
00:24:16.200 --> 00:24:19.600
- Musti.
 - I, Musti.

294
00:24:23.240 --> 00:24:27.320
It was a strike ... a word I learned today.

295
00:24:27.480 --> 00:24:33.280
... as the police did at a wedding.
 And they seized several criminals there.

296
00:24:33.440 --> 00:24:38.320
After the strike they noticed, "Okay, this is where everyone is."

297
00:24:38.480 --> 00:24:44.000
It was a good opportunity to arrest more criminals, because there everyone gathers.

298
00:24:44.160 --> 00:24:47.080
Especially those who keep a low profile.

299
00:24:47.240 --> 00:24:52.280
So it was a strike that the police made.
 Strike.

300
00:24:57.080 --> 00:25:01.080
- What do you say, Annika?
 - I think it's true.

301
00:25:01.240 --> 00:25:03.720
You think it's true?

302
00:25:03.880 --> 00:25:08.200
Congratulations, Christina.
 You just got a point.

303
00:25:11.560 --> 00:25:14.520
As we see now, much more even.

304
00:25:14.680 --> 00:25:18.080
It was an effort against tax fault in Södertälje.

305
00:25:18.240 --> 00:25:21.520
The proceeds from Syrian wedding floors were high -

306
00:25:21.680 --> 00:25:24.560
- But the tax paid Very Low.

307
00:25:24.720 --> 00:25:29.560
The effort also showed that 1/3 of the liquor sold was full spirit.

308
00:25:29.720 --> 00:25:34.080
Christina, it now stands 4-3 to Annika.

309
00:25:34.240 --> 00:25:38.760
- Should we try to get a fourth point?
 -Yes thank you.
 I choose the plush suit.

310
00:25:38.920 --> 00:25:42.920
- The shoes match.
 - Fan, what a good looking!
 Several shoes up.

311
00:25:43.080 --> 00:25:48.240
Christina, you chose Chang.
 But if you answer the wrong, the point goes to Annika.

312
00:25:48.400 --> 00:25:50.560
Then she has won.

313
00:25:50.720 --> 00:25:54.880
Chang, football player Maradona's old Argentine club ...

314
00:25:59.440 --> 00:26:02.880
They had pink clothes.
 Not as good looking as this one.

315
00:26:03.040 --> 00:26:06.640
They thought they were goofy.
 They were bullied.

316
00:26:06.800 --> 00:26:10.800
At that time you couldn't be feminine when you were a guy.

317
00:26:10.960 --> 00:26:14.600
They just: "Walla, the man. We must have new colors."

318
00:26:14.760 --> 00:26:17.800
They go down to the harbor and hang.

319
00:26:17.960 --> 00:26:23.600
There comes a boat with a Swedish flag.
 "We drive yellow and blue."

320
00:26:23.760 --> 00:26:26.000
Shit happens.

321
00:26:26.160 --> 00:26:30.680
You should hear Chang's history pod.
 It's crazy.
 - Christina?

322
00:26:30.840 --> 00:26:33.000
Can you trust a rum?

323
00:26:33.160 --> 00:26:39.320
I think, of course, Sweden comes and delivers its colors.
 True.

324
00:26:39.480 --> 00:26:42.040
–Sant?
 - Helt sick, but ...

325
00:26:42.200 --> 00:26:48.040
You are still in the match.
 Congratulations to your fourth point!

326
00:26:48.200 --> 00:26:52.320
