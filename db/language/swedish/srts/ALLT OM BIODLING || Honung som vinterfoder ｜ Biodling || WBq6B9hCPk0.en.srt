00:00:06.734 --> 00:00:11.688
[Buzzing bees and short classic dough]

2
00:00:24.774 --> 00:00:28.768
Ah now they are in the process of cleaning.

3
00:00:36.396 --> 00:00:49.055
Yes, today is March 27 and I am curious about and see how my bees have winter on honey alone.

4
00:00:49.055 --> 00:00:59.797
If they have managed the winter well, it is very outlook it is what I am looking for.

5
00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.000
That they are out flying, I see that.

6
00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:12.000
I see that outputs on some cups.

7
00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:16.000
But the bees seem to be spiked.

8
00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:22.000
And the winds are knocked out here on the slopes.

9
00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:34.000
We'll take a look here.

10
00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:38.000
There is plenty of bees all over the surface.

11
00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.000
So that...

12
00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.000
Heat has these.

13
00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.000
Then we lift off.

14
00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.000
Then we look here.

15
00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.000
It looks nice.

16
00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.000
Good with bees.

17
00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:13.000
Maybe these frames would be removed.

18
00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.000
They are empty.

19
00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:20.000
Probably there has been no fry in them.

20
00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:25.000
Then I will remove these frames.

21
00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:28.000
In a week.

22
00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:31.000
Or maybe we would do it today.

23
00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:37.000
But then we are already in the spring development.

24
00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:47.000
There are no fry here.

25
00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:52.000
So probably the fry is at the top.

26
00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:57.000
And then we lift this box.

27
00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:09.000
No, here is fry.

28
00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:14.000
So then you can't remove such frames.

29
00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:19.000
But then we have to change the frames.

30
00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:23.000
Dives, but we do not today.

31
00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:39.000
Look here, that's a lot of fry.

32
00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:42.000
Okay.

33
00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:44.000
Then we can re -put this.

34
00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:47.000
Say that this has been in a good winter.

35
00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:53.000
We can take the opportunity to replace it.

36
00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:06.000
Or turn on to the one we usually do.

37
00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:19.000
So.

38
00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:49.000
So.

39
00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:56.000
We look up here too.

40
00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:08.000
Do not laugh.

41
00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:15.000
It is forbidden to laugh at beekeepers.

42
00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:19.000
So.

43
00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:32.000
There is not a lot of food here either.

44
00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:36.000
We can put this away.

45
00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:51.000
Not much food left.

46
00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:07.000
Not here either.

47
00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:10.000
And there we have the bee queen.

48
00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:19.000
Then we know.

49
00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:23.000
We have seen fry in the lower box.

50
00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:26.000
We'll see if we find anything more.

51
00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:34.000
No covered fry here.

52
00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:41.000
This indicates that there is quite a bit of food left.

53
00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:44.000
Yes.

54
00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:52.000
This must be food.

55
00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:54.000
No, this must have food.

56
00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:11.000
There is no food here.

57
00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:15.000
The frames are light.
 There should be food here.

58
00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:18.000
And here you can see.

59
00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:20.000
These are covered cells.

60
00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:23.000
And that's honey underneath.

61
00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:29.000
And that is certainly in these frameworks as well.

62
00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:34.000
But it is too little to be at the end of March.

63
00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:39.000
So there should be at least 68 kilos of honey left.

64
00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:45.000
It is completely drunk.

65
00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:50.000
On both sides.

66
00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:53.000
So that they can handle a few weeks at least.

67
00:07:54.000 --> 00:08:04.000
Then that frame is also quite full.

68
00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:06.000
Oh.

69
00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:14.000
Oh.

70
00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:18.000
So there are two frames just full.

71
00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:22.000
And so is a frame that is half full.

72
00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:26.000
So there is a 5 kilo honey left.

73
00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:33.000
But we will give them more as soon as the weather gets a little better.

74
00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:37.000
Then we will increase it.

75
00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:55.000
And then we will see what the bottom looks like on this bee community.

76
00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:59.000
It's pretty much.

77
00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:07.000
So.

78
00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:25.000
When you look at this fall, it should be quite dry.

79
00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:32.000
Do you see here, there is nothing that is rotten and moist underneath.

80
00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:35.000
The bees fall down.

81
00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:38.000
Dry and fine.

82
00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:40.000
So.

83
00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:02.000
Now we can go to the next bee community.

84
00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:04.000
So.

85
00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:10.000
Here you can see.

86
00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:13.000
After all, they haven't gone up here.

87
00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:16.000
Bees.
 There are three boxes.

88
00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:20.000
There are no bees up here.

89
00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:23.000
So.

90
00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:32.000
Oh here it was food.

91
00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:40.000
And here is bees.

92
00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:44.000
Should we see how it is further down here.

93
00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:50.000
Also bees.

94
00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:52.000
Also bees.

95
00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:16.000
Here it was food.

96
00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:25.000
Also food.

97
00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:28.000
Here you see a little dead bees.

98
00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:30.000
Also bees.

99
00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:54.000
So you see dead bees here pretty much.

100
00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:01.000
So.

101
00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:09.000
But the dead bees are dry.

102
00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:12.000
So then you see that.

103
00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:15.000
To.

104
00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:20.000
The bottoms work with this aeration.

105
00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:23.000
Look here huh.

106
00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:31.000
So.

107
00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:38.000
But you see they have shit.

108
00:12:38.783 --> 00:12:41.000
Here anyway.

109
00:12:41.203 --> 00:12:44.000
Has it been a bit outdated at the entrance.

110
00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:48.000
But they have not done anything on the frames.

111
00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:56.000
And then it is nice to be able to just turn on.

112
00:12:57.000 --> 00:12:59.000
This bottom.

113
00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:05.000
Block out the exit backwards and have in one.

114
00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:09.000
Exit on the front.

115
00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:55.000
Here it was fry.

116
00:13:56.000 --> 00:13:58.000
And it was a shame it.

117
00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:05.000
Because I had thought I would have removed.

118
00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:08.000
This box.

119
00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:45.000
So we do so.

120
00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:48.000
We remove it anyway.

121
00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:52.000
And choose.

122
00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:55.000
This one as a breeding room.

123
00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:03.000
Or rather.

124
00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:09.000
The one as a breeding room.

125
00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:13.000
At the bottom.
 Oh.

126
00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:38.000
There was food.

127
00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:48.000
Almost no food.

128
00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:46.000
I was expecting me to find fry here in this box.

129
00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:49.000
Since.

130
00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:52.000
It is.

131
00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:54.000
So much bees here.

132
00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:56.000
But I see nothing.

133
00:16:56.000 --> 00:16:58.000
I've only seen the fry in it.

134
00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:00.000
That bottom box.

135
00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:05.000
But it is good with food here.

136
00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:20.000
But that's clean.
 It is not.

137
00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:23.000
It is not downhill.

138
00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:26.000
Out of.

139
00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:28.000
Outdoor.

140
00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:47.000
Because we have been invented on honey.

141
00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:53.000
So it is both a relief for the beekeeper and for the bees.

142
00:17:53.000 --> 00:17:55.000
If you have honey.

143
00:17:55.000 --> 00:17:58.000
And you have a hard time selling.

144
00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:03.000
Then you can just as well use some of that honey than to buy it

145
00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:07.000
to the sugar price that has risen as a rocket.

146
00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:09.000
But we'll see how wintering has gone.

147
00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:11.000
Because it's bees' own honey.

148
00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:14.000
And they don't feel good about all the honey.

149
00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:16.000
It can be leaf honey.

150
00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:18.000
And they are pouring inside.

151
00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:21.000
Here we see.

152
00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:23.000
That it is good with bees.

153
00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:26.000
And it's hot here.

154
00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:30.000
So we lift off and turn on the bottom.

155
00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:34.000
So we'll see what it looks like inside the boxes.

156
00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:45.000
Here it seems to be old frames that we should try to change.

157
00:18:45.000 --> 00:18:53.000
When we turn on the bottom we see what it looks like.

158
00:19:01.689 --> 00:19:07.320
Here we see a lot of dead bees.

159
00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:10.000
And they.

160
00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:15.000
We shovel down.

161
00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:20.000
The impaired.

162
00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:26.000
Here you see that it is.

163
00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:29.000
It's a little pronounced.

164
00:19:31.000 --> 00:19:34.000
But we'll see what it looks like on the bottom.

165
00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:37.000
So.

166
00:19:56.000 --> 00:19:59.000
It is more humid on this than on the others.

167
00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:02.000
What it may be due to.

168
00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:09.000
But for the time being we turn on the bottom.

169
00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:38.000
After all, there are frames that should be removed.

170
00:20:39.000 --> 00:20:41.000
We will see what the others look like.

171
00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:44.000
We don't find any fry here.

172
00:20:45.000 --> 00:20:47.000
So we shake them off.

173
00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:50.000
And then.

174
00:20:50.000 --> 00:20:52.000
Yes.

175
00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:10.000
And this is not a fry.

176
00:21:13.000 --> 00:21:16.000
Without it is old food.

177
00:21:20.000 --> 00:21:22.000
We can remove that too.

178
00:21:27.000 --> 00:21:29.000
That is also old food.

179
00:21:35.000 --> 00:21:37.000
It may be that it is.

180
00:21:39.000 --> 00:21:44.000
Yes it is crystallized honey that they had difficulty removed.

181
00:21:46.000 --> 00:21:48.000
But we remove those frames.

182
00:21:51.000 --> 00:21:53.000
Here is more.

183
00:22:06.000 --> 00:22:08.000
Here is also old food.

184
00:22:26.565 --> 00:22:29.000
There is some crystallized honey.

185
00:22:29.000 --> 00:22:31.000
It may remain at the bottom here.

186
00:22:32.348 --> 00:22:35.544
Then I remove the latter.

187
00:22:38.138 --> 00:22:40.138
Damn.

188
00:22:41.659 --> 00:22:45.000
It is one up there and crawls [a bee].

189
00:22:51.000 --> 00:22:57.000
So there were a 34 frames with crystallized honey here.

190
00:22:58.000 --> 00:23:00.000
And it may remain until further notice.

191
00:23:01.000 --> 00:23:05.000
So maybe it can't eat so we can change it for a little better honey.

192
00:23:06.000 --> 00:23:10.000
And here, this one was heavy so it could go away all that.

193
00:23:11.000 --> 00:23:13.000
Because here is food.

194
00:23:14.000 --> 00:23:16.000
You feel that on the weight.

195
00:23:50.000 --> 00:23:52.000
Pretty little food on this page.

196
00:23:53.000 --> 00:23:57.000
Then it is well on the opposite side.

197
00:24:02.000 --> 00:24:04.000
And here it starts to come.

198
00:24:05.000 --> 00:24:07.000
Slightly.

199
00:24:31.000 --> 00:24:33.000
And here we have bee queen.

200
00:24:40.000 --> 00:24:42.000
It looks good with fry then.

201
00:24:43.000 --> 00:24:45.000
Then we can leave these in peace.

202
00:24:46.000 --> 00:24:48.000
Because here there is food.

203
00:24:49.000 --> 00:24:51.000
Then we will change only the lower box.

204
00:24:54.000 --> 00:24:57.000
Because they have done well with the honey too.

205
00:24:59.000 --> 00:25:02.000
And that's what I was worried about.

206
00:25:03.000 --> 00:25:05.000
That it could be a bit outdated.

207
00:25:07.000 --> 00:25:17.000
Although it is summer honey, it may be honey that is mixed with leaf honey.

208
00:25:18.000 --> 00:25:22.000
For leaf honey, it probably also occurs in early summer.

209
00:25:23.000 --> 00:25:26.000
Especially as it was quite hot last year.

210
00:25:28.000 --> 00:25:30.000
In early summer.

211
00:25:31.000 --> 00:25:35.000
It was really when you got the big move.

212
00:25:37.000 --> 00:25:39.000
Autumn was lousy.

213
00:25:43.000 --> 00:25:45.000
We go down there.

214
00:26:19.000 --> 00:26:21.000
Here is some moisture.

215
00:26:22.000 --> 00:26:24.000
We have not seen that before.

216
00:26:25.000 --> 00:26:27.000
What it might be because it ...

217
00:26:29.000 --> 00:26:31.000
But we lift off.

218
00:26:32.000 --> 00:26:35.000
Or we take it on that page so we can see more here.

219
00:26:36.000 --> 00:26:38.000
We can film from here.

220
00:26:51.000 --> 00:26:55.000
We can look at these even though it was moisture here.

221
00:26:56.000 --> 00:26:59.000
If there is any crap on the frames.

222
00:27:02.000 --> 00:27:04.000
After all, it is not.

223
00:27:08.000 --> 00:27:11.000
Rather, it is crystallized honey here.

224
00:27:12.000 --> 00:27:14.000
Which they have had a hard time ...

225
00:27:15.000 --> 00:27:19.000
... to get out.

226
00:27:20.000 --> 00:27:23.217
You see clean frames here.
 Fine.

227
00:27:24.725 --> 00:27:28.087
We'll see a bump on this one.

228
00:28:04.000 --> 00:28:06.000
Here are old frames that we have set ...

229
00:28:07.000 --> 00:28:10.000
... in a group down to just be able to change easily.

230
00:28:11.000 --> 00:28:13.000
In the spring.

231
00:28:15.000 --> 00:28:17.000
But even those ...

232
00:28:18.000 --> 00:28:20.000
... is pretty clean.

233
00:28:24.000 --> 00:28:28.000
So they have not suffered any outspoken or ...

234
00:28:29.000 --> 00:28:31.000
... misery.

235
00:28:45.000 --> 00:28:49.000
Here is a small different type of bottom.

236
00:28:50.000 --> 00:28:52.000
And here you see that here it is ...

237
00:28:55.000 --> 00:28:57.000
...mold.

238
00:28:59.000 --> 00:29:01.000
And shit.

239
00:30:00.695 --> 00:30:03.695
But even though this one now looks dirty ...

240
00:30:03.876 --> 00:30:05.679
... so it has another ...

241
00:30:06.246 --> 00:30:08.246
... the same advantage that it is reversible.

242
00:30:10.498 --> 00:30:12.498
This bottom.

243
00:30:15.108 --> 00:30:17.100
So you can turn it around.

244
00:30:19.002 --> 00:30:21.002
So you can turn it ...

245
00:30:23.140 --> 00:30:24.980
... and use the other side.

246
00:30:51.770 --> 00:30:53.770
And it looks clean ...

247
00:30:55.733 --> 00:30:57.733
... on the frames I think.

248
00:30:58.023 --> 00:30:59.899
No shit.

249
00:31:03.110 --> 00:31:05.110
We can only see if we find ...

250
00:31:08.126 --> 00:31:10.126
... fry here.

251
00:31:12.000 --> 00:31:14.000
It's honey.
 They are doing well.

252
00:32:11.132 --> 00:32:13.132
It doesn't look like any fry.

253
00:32:23.244 --> 00:32:25.398
Here is the fry.

254
00:32:29.252 --> 00:32:31.220
Do you see it

255
00:32:33.221 --> 00:32:35.221
Here.

256
00:32:36.938 --> 00:32:39.634
And there goes the bee queen, I see.

257
00:32:45.239 --> 00:32:47.469
Then it's just that ...

258
00:32:49.209 --> 00:32:51.995
... put it again and remove that one ...

259
00:32:51.995 --> 00:32:53.606
...one...

260
00:32:54.000 --> 00:32:56.795
... the box ...

261
00:32:57.906 --> 00:32:59.906
... as the old frames were in.

262
00:33:04.458 --> 00:33:06.458
Oh here.
 This was ...

263
00:33:09.560 --> 00:33:11.560
... this was food.

264
00:33:16.000 --> 00:33:19.000
Here are frames that have ended up at the bottom of a box ...

265
00:33:20.000 --> 00:33:22.000
... where there was a fry in the frames.

266
00:33:23.000 --> 00:33:25.000
And I will remove them here.

267
00:33:26.000 --> 00:33:28.000
They are dark and fry -free.

268
00:33:29.000 --> 00:33:31.000
And they can go directly to the sunwax melt ...

269
00:33:32.000 --> 00:33:34.000
... who is starting to serve yesterday.

270
00:33:36.000 --> 00:33:38.000
Should you draw any conclusions on the interior with honey ...

271
00:33:39.000 --> 00:33:41.000
... so I think it's ...

272
00:33:42.000 --> 00:33:44.000
... valuable to try.

273
00:33:45.000 --> 00:33:47.000
It can be very much due to ...

274
00:33:48.000 --> 00:33:50.000
... the honey that you have managed to save on the spring edge.

275
00:33:52.000 --> 00:33:54.000
It is possible that it has been with a little leaf honey in some places here.

276
00:33:56.000 --> 00:33:58.000
But there is no danger, I think, with these bees.

277
00:34:00.000 --> 00:34:02.000
They haven't shit down into the hive, which I was afraid of.

278
00:34:04.000 --> 00:34:06.000
Without them, they have done well on the honey that I gave them for the Winter.

279
00:34:07.780 --> 00:34:09.780
They still have a good storage room.

280
00:34:11.851 --> 00:34:13.688
Possibly one had five kilos only left.

281
00:34:21.615 --> 00:34:23.615
But otherwise they have between six and nine kilos of honey left.

282
00:34:25.548 --> 00:34:27.548
So I'm happy with this.

283
00:34:31.415 --> 00:34:33.415
The advantages of inventing honey, is that ...

284
00:34:35.408 --> 00:34:36.919
...you do not have to...

285
00:34:37.234 --> 00:34:39.234
... divide and count on sugar prices.

286
00:34:39.763 --> 00:34:41.763
Without you have the honey you have and give them it.

287
00:34:43.343 --> 00:34:45.343
And you can expect the bees to wear out less ...

288
00:34:45.691 --> 00:34:47.691
... by invariably on honey.

289
00:34:47.821 --> 00:34:49.821
And you don't have to wear one of the interior buckets ...

290
00:34:50.603 --> 00:34:52.603
... after the other to them.

291
00:34:52.770 --> 00:34:54.770
It is an easier work, both for you and the bees.

292
00:34:55.045 --> 00:34:57.045
We have seen that all communities had their queen left.

293
00:34:58.008 --> 00:35:00.008
There were no disarray with ...

294
00:35:00.501 --> 00:35:02.501
... that it would be our drone mothers.

295
00:35:03.574 --> 00:35:05.574
So I'm happy with this.

296
00:35:06.000 --> 00:35:08.000
We look forward to ...

297
00:35:08.559 --> 00:35:10.559
... spring and flowering here.

298
00:35:10.761 --> 00:35:12.761
The trees are already full of buds.

299
00:35:13.000 --> 00:35:15.000
Cherry trees, it teases out of bud ...

300
00:35:15.746 --> 00:35:17.746
... in the branches.

301
00:35:18.000 --> 00:35:19.744
And also apple trees.

302
00:35:20.200 --> 00:35:22.200
So it looks good in Bigården.

303
00:35:22.768 --> 00:35:24.913
Happy Easter on you, we will hear.

304
00:35:25.526 --> 00:35:27.526
