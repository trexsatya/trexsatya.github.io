1
00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:30.420
I was going to start by asking you to tell you how you got into the thought

2
00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:34.740
That you would plug in at all.
 Do Ellika want to start?

3
00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:42.220
My career change has been based on the fact that I want to be involved and influence more

4
00:00:42.220 --> 00:00:47.060
And work on development issues, leadership issues, knowledge issues - -

5
00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:52.580
And it was so important for me to do it with a high quality -

6
00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:57.420
that I quickly landed in that I really want to have my feet -

7
00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:00.940
If I am going to work on these types of questions.

8
00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:05.540
When I with the help of coaches began to look at which courses existed

9
00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:09.180
And quickly found this one, I saw that it was so wide -

10
00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:13.580
And had so much of the pieces that I wanted to supplement with ...

11
00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:18.660
So yeah, it was pretty obvious even though it wasn't the first thing i thought

12
00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:25.100
When I thought about retraining or changing course.

13
00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:29.380
But it feels like a solid foundation, and quite necessary to get a job.

14
00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:35.260
Because I got these thoughts when there was time left before you got to start ...

15
00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:38.220
For singers it is an age limit of 45 years

16
00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:42.820
And these thoughts came to me around 43-44.

17
00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:47.300
Then I asked if it was possible to talk to an adviser in advance

18
00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:50.660
And it went really well.
 I can recommend that -

19
00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:55.900
Because it's a pretty long process.
 Also to realize what one needs to do -

20
00:01:55.900 --> 00:02:00.780
To enter the education with e.g.
 The college exam.

21
00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:05.140
Karin, how did your thoughts go before choosing a line

22
00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:08.380
And start plugging at all?

23
00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:15.020
I have taken quite a lot of independent courses at the university

24
00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:19.300
And also through my second job as a teacher at the School of Music -

25
00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:24.180
come into contact with constantly developing me skills.

26
00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:27.300
It began as a reaction to me getting a mission

27
00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:32.940
As course leader at the School of Music where I got more to bite in -

28
00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:36.620
Even I was used to in the orchestra ditch as a fluteist.

29
00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:39.100
It attracted my desire

30
00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:45.980
To learn more about organization and development work.

31
00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:50.500
When I then saw the opportunity with the Sok Foundation -

32
00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:56.860
set it off quite a lot of thoughts, and soon I landed in -

33
00:02:56.860 --> 00:03:02.980
That the staff and work life program would be exciting and fun.

34
00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:05.460
An exciting education

35
00:03:05.460 --> 00:03:11.620
With all different orientations.
 The interdisciplinary in it.

36
00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:14.900
Since then I have always been curious about what is happening

37
00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:20.180
On the second floor of the opera where the HR persons sit-

38
00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:23.940
And pondered a lot around ...

39
00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:29.100
... how to work in an organization by raising the level, to develop

40
00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:32.940
And what skills are available to take advantage of.

41
00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:37.540
So precisely the HR perspective has been with me for many years.

42
00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:42.500
So when the chance came, it was very easy to want to go there.

43
00:03:48.740 --> 00:03:54.980
There is an old prejudice or thought that one cannot plug

44
00:03:54.980 --> 00:03:58.980
And learn new after 20 years of age.
 In order to learn a language -

45
00:03:58.980 --> 00:04:02.140
Should you start at three and be finished at eighteen-

46
00:04:02.140 --> 00:04:05.940
Then you cannot acquire new knowledge.

47
00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:13.020
Do you feel that it is a correct analysis, do you want to start, Karin?

48
00:04:13.100 --> 00:04:20.860
Yes, that analysis feels old -fashioned in our society where learning is needed everywhere.

49
00:04:20.860 --> 00:04:24.580
The entire digital revolution in society requires learning

50
00:04:24.580 --> 00:04:34.940
And a constant flexibility and openness to change.

51
00:04:34.940 --> 00:04:39.020
Plugging at 20 is perhaps still the most common

52
00:04:39.020 --> 00:04:43.700
But far from the only thing.

53
00:04:43.700 --> 00:04:47.340
I think a lot has happened in recent years

54
00:04:47.340 --> 00:04:50.860
when it comes to who is plugging in the university.

55
00:04:51.380 --> 00:04:56.260
You can read 1,000 pages course literature in English

56
00:04:57.300 --> 00:05:02.500
Yes, the psychology book was 1 & nbsp; 001 pages in English.

57
00:05:02.500 --> 00:05:04.980
It is clear that there is a certain difference

58
00:05:04.980 --> 00:05:11.900
But both age categories have their advantages and disadvantages.

59
00:05:12.340 --> 00:05:15.180
I bump the question to you, Ellika, with with the addition

60
00:05:15.180 --> 00:05:20.940
That as an opera singer is regularly studied new works.

61
00:05:20.940 --> 00:05:23.340
It is also a form of learning.

62
00:05:23.620 --> 00:05:29.380
Yes, you have with you that you have been in a profession where you constantly learn new

63
00:05:29.380 --> 00:05:33.780
So I wasn't so worried about it.

64
00:05:33.780 --> 00:05:36.580
What I want to add is ...

65
00:05:36.580 --> 00:05:40.420
There is a quote by David Bowie that I now don't remember

66
00:05:40.420 --> 00:05:43.780
But it is about aging about - about -

67
00:05:43.780 --> 00:05:49.260
That you become more and more the one you are intended to be.

68
00:05:49.260 --> 00:05:52.700
It's so nice, because it's about why you plug.

69
00:05:52.700 --> 00:05:57.700
The older you get, the more your choice is about who you are

70
00:05:57.700 --> 00:06:00.420
And what abilities you have.

71
00:06:00.420 --> 00:06:05.220
Many people start their song and music career very young ...

72
00:06:05.220 --> 00:06:09.740
I started playing violin when I was five and from eighteen it was singing.

73
00:06:09.740 --> 00:06:12.700
I bought all the concepts with holes and hair.

74
00:06:12.700 --> 00:06:18.300
My choice when I was over 40 was much more based on who I have become

75
00:06:18.300 --> 00:06:21.660
And I didn't buy any finished concept.

76
00:06:21.660 --> 00:06:28.180
I think it is a very favorable breeding ground for learning

77
00:06:28.180 --> 00:06:33.500
Learning from one's own desire and curiosity to develop.

78
00:06:33.500 --> 00:06:37.140
What else should life be about when we live for so long

79
00:06:37.140 --> 00:06:43.980
Should we just stagnate the older we become it is an old thinking -

80
00:06:43.980 --> 00:06:49.100
From when you died at 55-60 and worn out from 40.

81
00:06:49.100 --> 00:06:54.940
So it doesn't look today.
 We actually have to fill our lives with something meaningful.

82
00:06:54.940 --> 00:07:03.100
Learning new makes you feel more vital, and it opens new worlds.

83
00:07:03.100 --> 00:07:07.140
It may happen that it takes a half hour extra to plug in certain things

84
00:07:07.140 --> 00:07:13.180
But you have completely different experiences to hang it up and do it out of desire.

85
00:07:13.180 --> 00:07:15.180
You should not underestimate that.

86
00:07:19.900 --> 00:07:26.500
Now you are both a bit into the program.
 You should plug 3.54 years -

87
00:07:26.500 --> 00:07:33.380
And have done about half now.
 - Lite just over.
 We are in the last year.

88
00:07:33.380 --> 00:07:39.300
If you were to try to do a kind before and asking ...

89
00:07:39.300 --> 00:07:45.060
We start with you, Karin.
 Can you describe the difference

90
00:07:45.060 --> 00:07:49.980
Between what you thought and what you actually are with?

91
00:07:52.180 --> 00:07:56.340
Interdisciplinary as I mentioned before

92
00:07:56.340 --> 00:07:59.700
Don't be so ready for me when I applied for the program.

93
00:07:59.700 --> 00:08:05.100
It has been a great opportunity to broaden one's own perspective

94
00:08:05.100 --> 00:08:09.740
In a helicopter perspective over the community -

95
00:08:09.740 --> 00:08:14.460
And one's role in the importance of that work.

96
00:08:14.460 --> 00:08:17.380
The training has been amazing

97
00:08:17.380 --> 00:08:22.740
and the opportunity to delve into the different pieces at all -

98
00:08:22.740 --> 00:08:31.420
which is pedagogy, sociology, psychology and even
 Finance and labor law.

99
00:08:31.420 --> 00:08:34.900
It has been a lot of fun.

100
00:08:35.820 --> 00:08:43.660
Did you have fears about you would not be able to do with pace

101
00:08:43.660 --> 00:08:52.380
Or have enough data competence, or was there any resistance in you before?

102
00:08:53.780 --> 00:08:59.180
The digital competence became alert that one must switch up

103
00:08:59.180 --> 00:09:03.660
In relation to what you do when working as a musician -

104
00:09:03.660 --> 00:09:08.540
And it is an important part to absorb if you are going to do a career change -

105
00:09:08.540 --> 00:09:12.300
or broaden their knowledge.
 There you will not get away!

106
00:09:12.300 --> 00:09:16.020
It really is a necessary evil and also very fun!

107
00:09:16.020 --> 00:09:18.980
I almost look like learning a new instrument

108
00:09:18.980 --> 00:09:23.180
to dive into the new programs and what is required.

109
00:09:23.180 --> 00:09:25.780
But otherwise also a lot of literature

110
00:09:25.780 --> 00:09:29.220
And scientific articles, many times in English.

111
00:09:29.220 --> 00:09:32.660
Of course it is a challenge but also very fun -

112
00:09:32.660 --> 00:09:35.060
to get that challenge.

113
00:09:36.660 --> 00:09:41.540
Ellika, how do you feel for what you had thought you would be able to be with

114
00:09:41.540 --> 00:09:43.580
And what it looks like now?

115
00:09:44.660 --> 00:09:48.780
It was a change to enter the academic world

116
00:09:48.780 --> 00:09:55.900
focused on academic thinking, and to think more in terms of research.

117
00:09:55.900 --> 00:10:00.860
There I had a resistance, that it wasn't just "you should learn this"

118
00:10:00.860 --> 00:10:05.380
Without you to do things in a certain form, and there are rules.

119
00:10:05.380 --> 00:10:09.700
It took time to get in, and I've struggled with some resistance with it.

120
00:10:09.700 --> 00:10:16.140
But now I can see that the scientific structure to present things

121
00:10:16.140 --> 00:10:20.020
or put forward arguments is incredibly good to have with -

122
00:10:20.020 --> 00:10:22.700
Whatever you do later.
 For a while I thought:

123
00:10:22.700 --> 00:10:27.180
"I should not become a researcher, why do I have to be able to all these methods"

124
00:10:27.180 --> 00:10:33.660
But now I can see that it is a tool for acquiring knowledge

125
00:10:33.660 --> 00:10:36.980
And present materials in a credible way.

126
00:10:36.980 --> 00:10:45.140
So it has been a journey for me to buy the academic approach.

127
00:10:45.140 --> 00:10:51.260
I was not aware that I gave in to that angle on it.

128
00:10:51.260 --> 00:10:57.860
But now I can see that it is a tool for acquiring knowledge in general.

129
00:10:57.860 --> 00:11:00.420
It is easy to think that one is going to an education

130
00:11:00.420 --> 00:11:03.340
To learn something, and then you are done with it.

131
00:11:03.340 --> 00:11:09.620
This is rather like getting tools to learn all your life.

132
00:11:09.620 --> 00:11:15.500
You have a confidence in that you are able to learn this.

133
00:11:15.500 --> 00:11:19.900
I just started my first job and notice that

134
00:11:19.900 --> 00:11:24.980
I have self -confidence that although there are a thousand new things at one time -

135
00:11:24.980 --> 00:11:28.860
Will I be able to do it because I have managed so much these two years.

136
00:11:28.860 --> 00:11:33.540
It becomes like a warm -up in being able to acquire new knowledge.

137
00:11:34.180 --> 00:11:38.180
I probably had a naive idea that this would be pretty quiet.

138
00:11:38.180 --> 00:11:41.460
I would take long walks in the botanical garden

139
00:11:41.460 --> 00:11:46.100
And have time to write.
 I had no idea how much work it was -

140
00:11:46.100 --> 00:11:49.340
And how much text masses to absorb.

141
00:11:51.420 --> 00:11:57.020
That being said, it is a completely different life.
 One has an eight-five-five-life-

142
00:11:57.020 --> 00:12:03.740
And vacant weekends.
 I have not had that in my entire working life.

143
00:12:03.740 --> 00:12:09.660
Getting into that rhythm is comparatively restful

144
00:12:09.660 --> 00:12:14.580
But it took some time to get into how to attack so much text -

145
00:12:14.580 --> 00:12:20.500
And impressions at once.
 It has not been quiet!

146
00:12:26.060 --> 00:12:31.500
You both come from a professional life with a high tempo

147
00:12:31.500 --> 00:12:37.500
and high demands to deliver at the moment-

148
00:12:37.500 --> 00:12:45.580
And you probably have a lot of expertise and knowledge in your spine.

149
00:12:45.580 --> 00:12:52.540
Is there any of the work you delivered on stage

150
00:12:52.540 --> 00:12:55.660
and in the orchestra ditch-

151
00:12:55.660 --> 00:12:59.340
As you have use and benefit when you plug?

152
00:12:59.580 --> 00:13:04.180
As a musician you have a huge discipline, otherwise you will not.

153
00:13:04.180 --> 00:13:11.740
You are used to practicing independently, working together in team ...

154
00:13:14.060 --> 00:13:17.460
An opera performance is based on having a goal

155
00:13:17.460 --> 00:13:22.060
to reach the premiere, and to gather around that goal.

156
00:13:22.060 --> 00:13:24.700
There are many pieces that I think ...

157
00:13:24.700 --> 00:13:32.260
As a musician or singer, you are not really aware of everything you can.

158
00:13:32.260 --> 00:13:37.100
When to gather and decide on what one wants to do

159
00:13:37.100 --> 00:13:40.540
Thanks to the possibility of the SOK Foundation-

160
00:13:40.540 --> 00:13:46.060
You sometimes forget that you have a lot that is positive with you.

161
00:13:48.180 --> 00:13:55.100
This bit with group work in a team

162
00:13:55.100 --> 00:13:59.340
Have we really worked with for so many years -

163
00:13:59.340 --> 00:14:03.540
Maybe without thinking so much consciously about it.

164
00:14:03.540 --> 00:14:07.580
But precisely the discipline and ability to focus

165
00:14:07.580 --> 00:14:11.900
Think I'm the biggest pieces that are a big plus.

166
00:14:11.900 --> 00:14:17.980
But you have to see it too, maybe get help from a counselor or coach ...

167
00:14:17.980 --> 00:14:23.780
"Think of all this that you can" "Yes, just that!"

168
00:14:23.780 --> 00:14:30.340
... to strengthen their self -confidence and be able to have the courage to take the step.

169
00:14:31.540 --> 00:14:37.060
Did it feel scary when you took the step?
 -Yes actually!

170
00:14:37.060 --> 00:14:46.300
To voluntarily resign and do this instead was very big.

171
00:14:46.300 --> 00:14:51.500
And many were surprised: "are you really going to do this"

172
00:14:51.500 --> 00:14:54.980
"You have a great job at the opera."

173
00:14:54.980 --> 00:15:01.100
But with me it would have been a longer process than you might think.

174
00:15:01.100 --> 00:15:09.980
So the longing for the new was stronger than the fear of losing what I had.

175
00:15:11.980 --> 00:15:15.100
How long was it scary then did it go over quickly?

176
00:15:15.220 --> 00:15:20.980
Yes, but the help you get through the advisers is fantastic.

177
00:15:20.980 --> 00:15:25.340
Because it needs to take its time.
 One needs to live in the ambivalence

178
00:15:25.340 --> 00:15:30.620
and be able to stay in the old one and feel that you might try it -

179
00:15:30.620 --> 00:15:33.780
So that you do not make too quick a decision.

180
00:15:33.780 --> 00:15:39.780
For me, it was important to be able to bounce the pros and cons with myself.

181
00:15:39.780 --> 00:15:46.460
Because it should be sustainable too.
 You should not think after three years: "What did I do"

182
00:15:46.460 --> 00:15:51.380
... and longing back.
 Without it, it must be a well -considered decision.

183
00:15:51.380 --> 00:15:56.340
And the advisers and even a coach that helped me at the beginning

184
00:15:56.340 --> 00:16:01.420
by structuring the thoughts ...

185
00:16:01.420 --> 00:16:06.380
It is an invaluable help that you should not hesitate to take.

186
00:16:06.380 --> 00:16:09.420
Even if one does not take the step fully

187
00:16:09.420 --> 00:16:13.220
Without just wanting to nose on what help there is to get -

188
00:16:13.220 --> 00:16:22.260
Is it good to contact the SOK Foundation and talk about it.
 Air their thoughts.

189
00:16:24.660 --> 00:16:31.100
How was it for you when you ... made the decision

190
00:16:31.740 --> 00:16:34.900
It's almost that you don't remember it now.

191
00:16:34.900 --> 00:16:42.180
I knew I wanted to do something else, that I needed to do something else.

192
00:16:42.180 --> 00:16:46.620
I had been working for so long and was ready

193
00:16:46.620 --> 00:16:49.860
That I did not want to do the same for 20 more years.

194
00:16:49.860 --> 00:16:54.380
I enjoy contrasts and changes in my life

195
00:16:54.380 --> 00:16:59.700
But also thinks it's hard.
 It is both "A Blessing and a Curse".

196
00:17:03.060 --> 00:17:09.380
Part of it is to meet the both admiration of their colleagues

197
00:17:09.380 --> 00:17:14.860
And disappointment that you leave.
 Admiration for daring to take the step -

198
00:17:14.860 --> 00:17:21.740
and disappointment and even
 a feeling of leaving -

199
00:17:21.740 --> 00:17:25.180
Because you look down on it or don't think it's good enough.

200
00:17:25.180 --> 00:17:28.380
That is very individual.
 It's a fantastic job

201
00:17:28.380 --> 00:17:32.380
But it sets certain requirements and has some restrictions.

202
00:17:32.380 --> 00:17:35.660
One begins to feel that the requirements do not fit a

203
00:17:35.660 --> 00:17:40.860
And that the restrictions inhibit one, and this opportunity exists ...

204
00:17:40.860 --> 00:17:45.340
But it was a challenge to meet ...

205
00:17:47.020 --> 00:17:51.740
Both admiration and disappointment should be respected, while at the same time being full

206
00:17:51.740 --> 00:17:58.220
With his own process that I have experienced has come and gone in waves.

207
00:17:58.220 --> 00:18:02.620
After all, change processes may catch up on one year later:

208
00:18:02.620 --> 00:18:07.780
"Just that, I will never have a premiere or go to a staff party at the opera anymore."

209
00:18:07.780 --> 00:18:11.300
Or whatever it may be.

210
00:18:13.140 --> 00:18:18.140
It's a little fragile ice sometimes, and you have to allow that, I think.

211
00:18:18.140 --> 00:18:23.900
Part of going through change is that it may feel uncomfortable sometimes

212
00:18:23.900 --> 00:18:25.900
But it is okay.

213
00:18:28.180 --> 00:18:31.540
It is a change you have chosen yourself

214
00:18:31.540 --> 00:18:34.820
And there is great value in it.

215
00:18:35.940 --> 00:18:40.940
But I thought about what you said about what you have with you from your professional life ...

216
00:18:40.940 --> 00:18:46.660
One should not underestimate one's habit of entering a professional role

217
00:18:46.660 --> 00:18:51.860
that there are very high demands on professionalism within opera.

218
00:18:51.860 --> 00:18:57.140
It requires everyone to know their thing and does it in the right place at the right time.

219
00:18:57.140 --> 00:19:04.060
It requires discipline and entering the professional role required right here.

220
00:19:04.060 --> 00:19:11.940
You have tremendous training on that.
 You can flame one second and then focus!

221
00:19:11.940 --> 00:19:14.300
One should not underestimate

222
00:19:14.300 --> 00:19:17.460
that it is a huge quality to have with you whatever one does -

223
00:19:17.460 --> 00:19:22.020
That you are used to delivering, focusing and doing everything with quality.

224
00:19:22.740 --> 00:19:27.700
Working life today also looks so different than 2025 years ago.

225
00:19:27.700 --> 00:19:30.900
Then they stayed longer in the same profession.

226
00:19:30.900 --> 00:19:35.900
Today it may also be about moving, making new contacts

227
00:19:35.900 --> 00:19:41.180
and change employers in a completely different way - even
 to change career.

228
00:19:41.180 --> 00:19:46.780
It is also a big bit of what it will look like

229
00:19:46.780 --> 00:19:53.700
And that it is not so strange to learn new things and plug.

230
00:19:54.020 --> 00:19:59.260
I have to connect how natural it feels to change in the middle of life.

231
00:19:59.260 --> 00:20:04.020
Once you do it you think: "Don't everyone want to do this"

232
00:20:04.020 --> 00:20:08.020
Then you are different as people.
 It is suitable for changing tracks in the middle of life.

233
00:20:08.020 --> 00:20:12.060
It may not suit everyone, but I have met many who say:

234
00:20:12.060 --> 00:20:16.900
"Oh, I would have liked to do. I want to get something new now"

235
00:20:16.900 --> 00:20:22.180
At 4555 you have quite many years left to work, actually.

236
00:20:23.060 --> 00:20:26.740
Many also have the notion that they could not plug

237
00:20:26.740 --> 00:20:30.500
That it was so long since last time, and so on.

238
00:20:30.500 --> 00:20:33.900
And that you often limit yourself.

239
00:20:33.900 --> 00:20:38.300
But it is very much about having role models and hearing about

240
00:20:38.300 --> 00:20:43.300
That you have dared to take the step.
 - There are many courses ...

241
00:20:43.300 --> 00:20:48.660
We are suitable for the university.
 It might not fit everyone

242
00:20:48.660 --> 00:20:54.020
But then there is certainly something with another type of education they want to work with.

243
00:20:54.180 --> 00:21:01.660
Today there are fantastic opportunities.
 Mooc massive open online courses -

244
00:21:01.660 --> 00:21:05.060
Available all over the world.
 Many people do not know it.

245
00:21:05.060 --> 00:21:09.900
You can follow courses in New York and at various fine universities.

246
00:21:09.900 --> 00:21:13.780
There is so much as one does not know

247
00:21:13.780 --> 00:21:19.020
And it can be an input to expose yourself to learning new.

248
00:21:19.020 --> 00:21:22.780
You can sneak tests!
 -Just!

249
00:21:22.780 --> 00:21:28.020
I started my career switching by plugging at half -time

250
00:21:28.020 --> 00:21:35.540
And it suited me pretty well.
 I got soft -start into how it was -

251
00:21:35.540 --> 00:21:39.980
And feel that it actually went well.
 So you can test that!

252
00:21:45.740 --> 00:21:53.060
Many of one's fellow students are perhaps younger, 2025 years.

253
00:21:53.060 --> 00:21:56.460
Is it a lead or disadvantage?
 - We have had each other.

254
00:21:56.460 --> 00:21:59.860
It has been very worthwhile I can't imagine -

255
00:21:59.860 --> 00:22:07.340
How it would have been the only one over 30 among 80 people.

256
00:22:07.340 --> 00:22:14.900
But you get into it in some way.
 Finally, you stop thinking age.

257
00:22:16.460 --> 00:22:22.700
It's like most things.
 When new is so aware of it

258
00:22:22.700 --> 00:22:27.140
And think about it.
 But now I don't think much about it anymore.

259
00:22:27.140 --> 00:22:29.420
And you find ...

260
00:22:30.060 --> 00:22:34.260
It is about finding them that one cooperates well with

261
00:22:34.260 --> 00:22:36.740
And it's about something other than age.

262
00:22:36.740 --> 00:22:42.500
When you find them, their social security number does not matter.

263
00:22:44.700 --> 00:22:49.060
Do you think the same?
 - Absolutely, I recognize it.

264
00:22:49.980 --> 00:22:56.340
Something that can help one when you have different age categories ...

265
00:22:57.260 --> 00:23:03.260
We who have a professional career behind us, or are in the middle of it

266
00:23:03.260 --> 00:23:10.820
Need to feel respect for the younger ones.
 Not: "I'm my mind or so."

267
00:23:10.820 --> 00:23:16.420
Having the humble attitude helps a lot, and they feel that.

268
00:23:16.420 --> 00:23:21.260
The teachers also talked a lot about having a mixed class

269
00:23:21.260 --> 00:23:23.780
With different ages and life experiences.

270
00:23:23.780 --> 00:23:26.300
It is very rewarding.

271
00:23:26.300 --> 00:23:31.540
I get such respect for the knowledge of these young people

272
00:23:31.540 --> 00:23:36.300
And their point of view.
 You get many perspectives with them -

273
00:23:36.300 --> 00:23:38.660
that are valuable.

274
00:23:38.660 --> 00:23:42.820
To get them so close.
 You sit next to each other in the benches and discuss.

275
00:23:42.820 --> 00:23:46.620
You get a task from the teacher and have a snack.

276
00:23:46.620 --> 00:23:54.980
It depends more on who you are as a person and what attitude you have.

277
00:23:54.980 --> 00:24:01.660
We define so much by age and profession in many contexts.

278
00:24:01.660 --> 00:24:08.060
You do not ask "who are you" but "what do you" or even
 "She's si and so old".

279
00:24:08.060 --> 00:24:13.660
So if you let go of it yourself, I think you radiate something else

280
00:24:13.660 --> 00:24:17.420
than that you are very fixed to it.

281
00:24:18.500 --> 00:24:23.540
With a slightly higher age you can actually contribute with a calm.

282
00:24:24.740 --> 00:24:28.900
I can remember myself from the age that one became very stressed out

283
00:24:28.900 --> 00:24:32.420
over exams and things to be delivered.

284
00:24:32.420 --> 00:24:35.100
I should not say that I have not been nervous

285
00:24:35.100 --> 00:24:44.260
But you have a different experience and can't cope with everything -

286
00:24:44.260 --> 00:24:49.620
And life is so complex.
 So I feel that we can contribute:

287
00:24:49.620 --> 00:24:55.300
"Now we do this, it will be fine. Think about this ..."

288
00:24:55.300 --> 00:25:01.700
Then you can both give and take, when you contribute your experience.

289
00:25:01.860 --> 00:25:04.220
Yes, that last ...

290
00:25:04.220 --> 00:25:07.700
It's also so fun in this education ...

291
00:25:07.700 --> 00:25:14.060
We talk so much about sociological and educational theories in the subjects

292
00:25:14.060 --> 00:25:18.660
and we sit with a full working life in the back -

293
00:25:18.660 --> 00:25:23.620
And can directly orient us in a theory.

294
00:25:23.620 --> 00:25:27.140
Out of memory you pick up situations: "ah"

295
00:25:27.140 --> 00:25:31.980
And so you look at your model and understand: "It happened there."

296
00:25:31.980 --> 00:25:41.100
As a younger one, you may not have as easy to color the models as we do.

297
00:25:41.300 --> 00:25:43.260
No, it becomes more abstract.

298
00:25:43.260 --> 00:25:49.140
It is fantastic to have experience to hang up the new knowledge.

299
00:25:49.140 --> 00:25:55.460
And when you, like us, read about working life, it's very worthwhile

300
00:25:55.460 --> 00:25:59.140
Both for yourself and the surroundings that you have worked for a long time.

301
00:25:59.140 --> 00:26:03.740
Actually, I think they should have requirements for work experience

302
00:26:03.740 --> 00:26:07.740
on the program.
 It doesn't have to be a requirement but a recommendation -

303
00:26:07.740 --> 00:26:11.860
Because then you get much more out of it.
 But many young people have worked.

304
00:26:11.860 --> 00:26:15.100
Almost all our courses have worked a little neighbor.

305
00:26:15.100 --> 00:26:17.460
It is noticeable that it makes a difference.

306
00:26:23.180 --> 00:26:30.820
You who both will work with staff groups in the future ...

307
00:26:31.580 --> 00:26:35.660
I know that you both have thoughts about lifelong learning and weight

308
00:26:35.660 --> 00:26:40.660
because even as an employee who should not do a career exchange -

309
00:26:40.660 --> 00:26:45.020
Learn in his profession.

310
00:26:47.140 --> 00:26:55.100
Are there any thoughts about lifelong learning that you want to share

311
00:26:55.100 --> 00:26:56.700
Karin

312
00:26:59.660 --> 00:27:05.500
We have pedagogy as our depth, and it may be more about the aspect

313
00:27:05.500 --> 00:27:09.140
to encourage staff in an organization -

314
00:27:09.140 --> 00:27:15.660
To constantly work on their skills development.

315
00:27:15.660 --> 00:27:19.380
It is clearly noticed, not least after the pandemic

316
00:27:19.380 --> 00:27:23.420
How important it will be to quickly absorb new digital tools -

317
00:27:23.420 --> 00:27:31.460
And adapt.
 It is almost a requirement in most organizations today.

318
00:27:31.460 --> 00:27:35.980
Being quick, being able to learn new and having that humility too.

319
00:27:35.980 --> 00:27:41.220
Even as high in an organization you have to work

320
00:27:41.220 --> 00:27:46.540
with taking up new ones.
 You can't rest on your stocks.

321
00:27:46.940 --> 00:27:53.340
And that one can see it as an opportunity instead of a compulsion

322
00:27:53.500 --> 00:27:55.420
Yes absolutely.

323
00:27:56.260 --> 00:28:02.020
Learning new is so much about changing the perspective

324
00:28:02.020 --> 00:28:08.860
Or see several perspectives.
 It may have been the clearest lesson -

325
00:28:08.860 --> 00:28:14.700
Even in this education with many perspectives with different subject areas.

326
00:28:14.700 --> 00:28:20.780
And it's fun to have the opportunity to widen the world in some way.

327
00:28:21.940 --> 00:28:27.500
And also understand the context: what does the opera mean in society

328
00:28:27.500 --> 00:28:30.500
And what does culture in society mean, etc.

329
00:28:30.500 --> 00:28:36.060
When working at an institution you easily become like a large family

330
00:28:36.060 --> 00:28:40.900
But don't really have all the perspectives you could have.

331
00:28:40.900 --> 00:28:47.220
And I feel that is a lovely, fun and exciting insight.

332
00:28:47.700 --> 00:28:50.260
What do you think about lifelong learning

333
00:28:50.260 --> 00:28:54.260
Would you jump on a new education in 15 years

334
00:28:55.740 --> 00:28:59.900
I think learning is very much about confidence

335
00:28:59.900 --> 00:29:04.900
That we are happy to be a little afraid of something that we have not tried before -

336
00:29:04.900 --> 00:29:09.820
And it feels uncomfortable.
 Then when one bit by bit conquers something -

337
00:29:09.820 --> 00:29:16.220
If you get self -confidence and dare to try new things more and more.

338
00:29:16.220 --> 00:29:21.580
But sometimes you have to expose yourself, and there you have a huge experience

339
00:29:21.580 --> 00:29:25.860
As a professional singer or musician, because sometimes one gets a piece -

340
00:29:25.860 --> 00:29:33.500
Which is the most difficult thing done.
 You don't get into it ...

341
00:29:33.500 --> 00:29:36.380
And then you should over the threshold, and suddenly you can

342
00:29:36.380 --> 00:29:38.780
And suddenly it's fun.

343
00:29:38.780 --> 00:29:43.020
As a professional singer or musician should not be underestimated

344
00:29:43.020 --> 00:29:49.380
That you have the tool to get through and cope with the resistance -

345
00:29:49.380 --> 00:29:53.620
And build up self -confidence.
 It's a staircase one walks uph's

346
00:29:53.620 --> 00:29:58.300
All the time in life, I think.
 You face new challenges -

347
00:29:58.300 --> 00:30:00.300
With everything possible, and ...

348
00:30:01.540 --> 00:30:05.260
We should not forget that life is constantly changing.

349
00:30:05.260 --> 00:30:12.260
We have to learn what it is like to live with toddlers, teens, outdoor children

350
00:30:12.260 --> 00:30:14.260
Aging parents ...

351
00:30:14.260 --> 00:30:18.940
We are constantly facing such challenges in our privacy.

352
00:30:20.780 --> 00:30:24.060
I don't buy that we learn best when we are young

353
00:30:24.060 --> 00:30:27.860
Without I think we are made to learn and develop all the time.

354
00:30:27.860 --> 00:30:30.420
We are made to meet challenges

355
00:30:30.420 --> 00:30:33.820
But it is so easy to listen to the voice that says:

356
00:30:33.820 --> 00:30:36.660
"I can't, it feels uncomfortable."

357
00:30:36.660 --> 00:30:40.260
I don't know about how many things I thought "that's nothing to me"

358
00:30:40.260 --> 00:30:44.820
And then I end up there and it was as good as any.

359
00:30:44.820 --> 00:30:47.860
The resistors we have ...

360
00:30:49.180 --> 00:30:52.420
It is probably a shelter in order not to expose us to whatever

361
00:30:52.420 --> 00:30:54.540
But that is not always true.

362
00:31:03.860 --> 00:31:07.900
If you were to be invited to a staff party at Malmö Opera

363
00:31:07.900 --> 00:31:10.980
and meet colleagues who wonder:

364
00:31:10.980 --> 00:31:16.580
"To plug when you have a career behind it is worth it"

365
00:31:16.580 --> 00:31:19.020
"Should I do that what do you think?"

366
00:31:19.220 --> 00:31:24.460
If someone asks, I think about being curious: "Dare"

367
00:31:24.460 --> 00:31:32.660
Another important thing is to work with the idea of widening their network.

368
00:31:32.660 --> 00:31:36.060
Not only to spend time with like -minded

369
00:31:36.060 --> 00:31:43.100
And in this way also challenge itself.

370
00:31:43.100 --> 00:31:49.420
To have a circle of friends with many different people and occupational categories

371
00:31:49.420 --> 00:31:57.820
Have probably aroused the desire to learn and dare to take the step for me.

372
00:31:57.820 --> 00:32:05.140
But ... just the courage to dare to take the step.

373
00:32:05.140 --> 00:32:07.820
Many may not even think about

374
00:32:07.820 --> 00:32:11.580
able to do anything other than play or sing.

375
00:32:13.420 --> 00:32:16.500
Then that's one thing.
 But it is also important

376
00:32:16.500 --> 00:32:23.820
To see if you really want to stay for the pension in your role.

377
00:32:23.820 --> 00:32:28.300
Will you be able to do it and how will it be at the end?

378
00:32:28.300 --> 00:32:31.980
Many people probably think the thought that it can be pretty tough

379
00:32:31.980 --> 00:32:34.980
But it does not think fully.

380
00:32:36.220 --> 00:32:40.100
From that point of view you can also have a discussion.

381
00:32:40.100 --> 00:32:43.940
I think it's just so taboo too.

382
00:32:43.940 --> 00:32:49.380
If you raise the question, many people think: "Is there anything wrong with my game or"

383
00:32:49.380 --> 00:32:58.940
It is so closely associated with the person and what you performed as a musician.

384
00:32:58.940 --> 00:33:02.580
It is a fairly complex and sensitive situation.

385
00:33:02.580 --> 00:33:04.980
Giving a tip where I don't know ...

386
00:33:05.300 --> 00:33:09.300
But to reason and open your eyes a little.

387
00:33:11.740 --> 00:33:13.740
I can imagine that many

388
00:33:13.740 --> 00:33:19.660
Still, would be curious and want to ask how you feel it is.

389
00:33:20.580 --> 00:33:26.620
But I think it must also come from desire or curiosity.

390
00:33:26.620 --> 00:33:30.540
Working as we do means that you have to choose a lot in your life.

391
00:33:30.540 --> 00:33:33.260
You have to focus.

392
00:33:34.500 --> 00:33:36.780
If there is anything else as you thought:

393
00:33:36.780 --> 00:33:38.860
"Wondering what it's like to work with it ..."

394
00:33:38.860 --> 00:33:42.820
"I would have liked to use this side of myself more ..."

395
00:33:42.820 --> 00:33:48.020
"I'm a little worn out just working on this part of my abilities ..."

396
00:33:48.900 --> 00:33:52.020
... then there is something to pick up there.

397
00:33:52.020 --> 00:33:56.500
Then one can start widening their picture of what this something is

398
00:33:56.500 --> 00:33:59.380
By taking a lunch with someone working on it.

399
00:33:59.380 --> 00:34:05.900
Like traveling to another continent: you know you want to go there but no more.

400
00:34:05.900 --> 00:34:09.940
Then you start reading books, watch some movie and ask someone who has been there

401
00:34:09.940 --> 00:34:13.700
And suddenly you have booked the ticket and are there.

402
00:34:13.700 --> 00:34:16.100
It is such a type of process.

403
00:34:16.100 --> 00:34:21.980
There is some seed in one because you do this.

404
00:34:21.980 --> 00:34:25.980
You do this because you want something.

405
00:34:25.980 --> 00:34:29.740
But it's all about widening, and it may take some time

406
00:34:29.740 --> 00:34:33.780
Because you have been here: "How do I perform best tonight?"

407
00:34:33.780 --> 00:34:37.260
It is perhaps what life has been a lot about

408
00:34:37.260 --> 00:34:41.300
To make a really good performance tomorrow.

409
00:34:41.580 --> 00:34:45.580
But if someone would ask: "Do you think I would be able to plug"

410
00:34:45.980 --> 00:34:48.180
Yes, but God.
 Yes

411
00:34:48.700 --> 00:34:52.260
But you should plug something you want.
 That's the thing that is the thing

412
00:34:52.260 --> 00:34:58.060
And there will be doubt on the road, it does so with all the changes.

413
00:34:58.060 --> 00:35:01.420
My God, however in love you are when moving together

414
00:35:01.420 --> 00:35:04.140
Will you wonder what you have done.

415
00:35:04.140 --> 00:35:07.220
Then you conclude that it was pretty good anyway.

416
00:35:08.580 --> 00:35:12.620
It is so cool with new knowledge, it is such a kick

417
00:35:12.620 --> 00:35:15.140
And you get such respect for people.

418
00:35:15.140 --> 00:35:21.500
The opera world is a bit navel -gazing, you just think about what is moving in it.

419
00:35:21.500 --> 00:35:24.700
For me, it has been so anyway.
 But now I have seen:

420
00:35:24.700 --> 00:35:30.220
"Oh, what many professions there are what a lot of knowledge people have!"

421
00:35:31.540 --> 00:35:39.380
It is a kick and a humility for what the rest of the world has to offer.

422
00:35:42.220 --> 00:35:44.900
Do you have something you want to add

423
00:35:46.820 --> 00:35:49.900
Working in a large organization ...

424
00:35:49.900 --> 00:35:56.060
After all, we have had a large organization that you have not had full insight into.

425
00:35:56.900 --> 00:36:03.540
It has been fun to almost retrospectively gain understanding

426
00:36:03.540 --> 00:36:08.020
for what you have been in. And so has ...

427
00:36:08.020 --> 00:36:14.180
... in a way broadened views, that one sees another aspect

428
00:36:14.180 --> 00:36:17.980
for example
 The employer side in another way in such an education.

429
00:36:18.140 --> 00:36:23.540
We had a task where we looked at the Opera's annual report.
 It hit me:

430
00:36:23.540 --> 00:36:27.740
"Why have I never done this I have worked here for so many years!"

431
00:36:27.740 --> 00:36:30.860
It is to come in from another direction.
 -Really!

432
00:36:30.860 --> 00:36:34.180
You also get a different understanding of what it is like to be a manager.

433
00:36:34.180 --> 00:36:38.420
It is easily happened as an employee that you do not have the full picture.

434
00:36:38.420 --> 00:36:46.100
If you work within HR I really think it's important to bring

435
00:36:46.100 --> 00:36:49.820
That many employees do not have the full picture.

436
00:36:49.820 --> 00:36:56.180
Then it is so easy to criticize, not understand the extent and their own role.

437
00:36:56.180 --> 00:37:01.860
It has been very exciting from the organizational point of view.

438
00:37:02.260 --> 00:37:05.580
I agree with.
 And that from a social perspective

439
00:37:05.580 --> 00:37:12.420
gain more understanding of the complexity of community and organizational issues-

440
00:37:12.420 --> 00:37:16.580
Which means that you no longer become as categorical.

441
00:37:16.580 --> 00:37:21.820
Further perspectives are carried with you for the rest of your life.

442
00:37:21.820 --> 00:37:24.700
It's a gift to have.
 -Very good!

443
00:37:32.020 --> 00:37:36.220
We round off the conversation with the wise words.

444
00:37:36.220 --> 00:37:41.060
We thank you for joining today!
 -It was fun.
 Thanks!

445
00:37:42.300 --> 00:37:47.860
... and wish you the best of luck in your next or current - career.

446
00:37:47.860 --> 00:37:53.260
If you have changed, you still say that you are an opera singer and musician -

447
00:37:53.260 --> 00:37:57.460
Or do you say that you are students or HR ...

448
00:38:00.740 --> 00:38:05.580
It all depends on how the question is asked.

449
00:38:05.580 --> 00:38:08.540
I'm probably a career exchanger right now.

450
00:38:11.140 --> 00:38:15.460
It was a good question.
 However, it is not so easy to answer.

451
00:38:15.460 --> 00:38:19.780
I am still teaching at the School of Music

452
00:38:19.780 --> 00:38:24.140
And last year I had a job as a HR consultant.

453
00:38:24.140 --> 00:38:28.660
Then you had to enter on LinkedIn that you are a HR consultant.

454
00:38:28.660 --> 00:38:34.380
Of course, it is now a period when finding your new role.

455
00:38:34.380 --> 00:38:38.780
So simply it is not.
 Because in soul and heart you are still musicians.

456
00:38:38.780 --> 00:38:43.100
The music and culture are so close.

457
00:38:43.980 --> 00:38:50.180
But it is also an opportunity to broaden it.
 To be left in that too

458
00:38:50.180 --> 00:38:54.900
in one way or another.
 I don't know where I will eventually end up.

459
00:38:54.900 --> 00:38:58.820
But hopefully you can take advantage of everything you have done

460
00:38:58.820 --> 00:39:02.260
And the insights one has from the cultural world.

461
00:39:03.020 --> 00:39:06.380
... with all the new.
 Able to contribute in some way.

462
00:39:06.620 --> 00:39:14.100
It's like being born in another country.
 It is such a deep part of one's identity.

463
00:39:14.100 --> 00:39:17.300
There will always be that I have been an opera singer.

464
00:39:17.300 --> 00:39:22.540
There is so much who I am and have with me.
 It's my "tribe" in some way.

465
00:39:23.340 --> 00:39:27.180
It will be exciting we will have a follow -up call in five years.

466
00:39:27.180 --> 00:39:30.060
Right.
 Good idea

467
00:39:30.700 --> 00:39:33.580
Thanks so much!
 -Thanks!
