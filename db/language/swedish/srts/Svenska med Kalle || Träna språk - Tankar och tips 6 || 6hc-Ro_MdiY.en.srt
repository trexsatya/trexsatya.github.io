00:00:02,480 --> 00:00:04,480
Hello.
 Good evening.

2
00:00:06,460 --> 00:00:08,460
It is Monday today.

3
00:00:09,180 --> 00:00:13,840
And I have found a little more fun background, my bookshelf.

4
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:19,200
With some mixed books in, you can check if there is anything you are curious to read

5
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:21,840
Although it may not be so good

6
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:24,080
What books it is

7
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:31,740
Anyway, tonight I was going to give a tip on how to practice talking in a fairly simple way

8
00:00:32,340 --> 00:00:36,160
and it is by using

9
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:38,100
to exploit

10
00:00:38,460 --> 00:00:43,440
people in town and in business

11
00:00:43,860 --> 00:00:50,380
who have paid to talk to you and who have paid to be nice

12
00:00:50,700 --> 00:00:57,720
namely different salesmen and people who work in information desks and such things

13
00:00:58,040 --> 00:01:00,680
So the first example would be to

14
00:01:00,940 --> 00:01:07,380
You know .. These ... often young people standing and selling mobile phones or mobile subscriptions

15
00:01:07,740 --> 00:01:18,180
Why not stop and say, “Yes, Hi, I've been thinking about getting a new mobile or a new mobile subscription

16
00:01:18,500 --> 00:01:20,500
What do you have to offer?

17
00:01:20,820 --> 00:01:27,920
And then you continue to, ie, ask questions about that product, about the product they want to say

18
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:34,560
And of course you can prepare this before so if we think the example of mobile phones

19
00:01:34,860 --> 00:01:38,960
so think a little, what questions are normal to ask

20
00:01:39,180 --> 00:01:41,940
Yes, it can be: Does it include surf?

21
00:01:42,140 --> 00:01:44,760
How much surf is it?

22
00:01:45,160 --> 00:01:47,160
Is it free text messages?

23
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:50,540
Can I call for free to my family?

24
00:01:50,540 --> 00:01:51,420
such things

25
00:01:51,640 --> 00:01:57,360
So I think you can find quite a few good sentences and words to use

26
00:01:57,620 --> 00:02:03,220
If you are going to ask questions and understand the answers that you get

27
00:02:03,440 --> 00:02:06,360
When you discuss a new mobile subscription

28
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:09,420
and then when you've been talking for a while

29
00:02:09,680 --> 00:02:14,160
So you can just say: "Thank you so much, I'll think about this, I'm not quite sure I ...

30
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:18,480
... I want to look at some other products too, or something like that "

31
00:02:18,780 --> 00:02:24,640
I think it would be a totally okay way to get a chance to talk "

32
00:02:24,860 --> 00:02:29,180
Similarly you can go into, for example, Clas Ohlson there is

33
00:02:29,420 --> 00:02:32,420
in many both larger cities and in smaller places

34
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:35,240
They have an information desk

35
00:02:35,460 --> 00:02:38,760
and so prepare to ask for something

36
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:43,460
Which headphones would you recommend to my iPhone?

37
00:02:43,660 --> 00:02:49,880
What is the difference between the listeners that cost SEK 100 and those that cost SEK 500.

38
00:02:50,060 --> 00:02:55,520
Or ask what adhesive to have for your new wallpaper, ... that is

39
00:02:55,720 --> 00:03:00,520
It doesn't matter, take something you are a little interested in and ...

40
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:05,260
simply try to prepare some questions and that you prepare what answers

41
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:10,140
can come so you understand what the person is saying

42
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:16,440
So you can simply, if you have a chat buddy or a friend who is good in Swedish

43
00:03:16,660 --> 00:03:23,080
So ask him or her and otherwise you can ask in the Facebook group

44
00:03:28,220 --> 00:03:30,980
so that a third idea, just to give someone more idea

45
00:03:31,220 --> 00:03:36,680
It is to call if you want to practice speaking on the phone so call customer tenses

46
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:43,200
So decide for you to now practice asking for a new kind of toaster

47
00:03:44,140 --> 00:03:47,540
And then you can call for example the Elgiganten

48
00:03:47,720 --> 00:03:52,140
And then you ask that “Hi, I've looked at this toaster called so and so

49
00:03:52,760 --> 00:03:55,300
Is it inside the store right now?

50
00:03:55,560 --> 00:04:01,920
Either they say yes and then can say yeah but, was that so much it cost?

51
00:04:02,160 --> 00:04:06,300
Or something, try to find some more question to ask or some more questions.

52
00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:09,080
You can ask if there are different colors for example

53
00:04:09,440 --> 00:04:14,680
and is it not inside yes then you can ask if it may be in any other store

54
00:04:14,980 --> 00:04:26,560
So try to find some sentences, questions and expressions that allow you to get the discussion to continue a little longer

55
00:04:27,700 --> 00:04:34,340
A basic thought that I want to share with you, a tip, it is to

56
00:04:37,480 --> 00:04:41,780
When to train and talk so ...

57
00:04:42,440 --> 00:04:47,100
Plan it, prepare it

58
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:51,960
Try to find simple situations

59
00:04:52,380 --> 00:04:57,620
and find words and sentences in advance that you can train on

60
00:04:58,040 --> 00:05:01,920
as you can learn and then when you end up in the situation

61
00:05:02,300 --> 00:05:04,840
so will you hear how the words

62
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:07,040
How they are pronounced

63
00:05:07,340 --> 00:05:09,920
you will hear how they are used in slightly different ways

64
00:05:10,140 --> 00:05:14,340
for the person may not say just as you have learned

65
00:05:14,640 --> 00:05:18,260
But that way not everything will be new to you

66
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:24,940
I think this can be a great way to get started and talk, to practice talking

67
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:31,060
and use sentences in ordinary contexts and not in just school or ...

68
00:05:31,420 --> 00:05:35,880
that you sit at home trying to sit and say sentences to yourself or so

69
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:39,840
that there are still real situations

70
00:05:40,140 --> 00:05:44,520
that you may actually have prepared in advance

71
00:05:44,840 --> 00:05:48,560
So test this very well and

72
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:53,020
Write a comment on Youtube or leave a comment in the Facebook group and say how it went

73
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:55,940
whether this was a good idea or not

74
00:05:56,240 --> 00:06:00,700
And then I'll be back soon with more tips in a new movie

75
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:05,780
Have a nice evening!
 See you again soon.
 Bye!
