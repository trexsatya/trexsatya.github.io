1
00:00:19,071 --> 00:00:21,589
When I think back on my schooling

2
00:00:21,589 --> 00:00:23,335
I think it's been hard,

3
00:00:23,335 --> 00:00:25,423
Hell and heaven

4
00:00:27,563 --> 00:00:30,881
What I see in front of me is incomprehension,

5
00:00:30,881 --> 00:00:34,423
Ignorance and confusion I would say.

6
00:00:36,327 --> 00:00:40,008
Hard, it has been confusing,

7
00:00:40,008 --> 00:00:41,951
And it has been depressed.

8
00:00:45,452 --> 00:00:48,242
Unspoken, tough but finally so

9
00:00:48,242 --> 00:00:50,623
was actually very good

10
00:00:52,189 --> 00:00:54,108
When I think back on my schooling

11
00:00:54,108 --> 00:00:55,951
so has it been like a prison

12
00:00:55,951 --> 00:00:58,126
It's been a waste of time to go

13
00:00:58,126 --> 00:01:00,012
To school, I think.

14
00:01:14,707 --> 00:01:19,431
At the old school the teachers had not really

15
00:01:19,431 --> 00:01:24,376
Check out, or no one control, what ADHD was.

16
00:01:24,376 --> 00:01:27,938
It should have been a clock - ding!
 He has ADHD.

17
00:01:27,938 --> 00:01:31,585
But I don't know what put a stop to it.

18
00:01:31,585 --> 00:01:35,316
I was so damn hyper but they didn't take.

19
00:01:35,316 --> 00:01:37,555
and it might be a bit frustrating to think about

20
00:01:37,555 --> 00:01:41,921
That they didn't see it.
 I sat for the phase of the ceiling all the time.

21
00:01:42,103 --> 00:01:46,145
I think the teachers had a hard time understanding me.

22
00:01:46,145 --> 00:01:50,615
I didn't say what was wrong with me,

23
00:01:50,615 --> 00:01:55,733
I kept it within me how I felt.

24
00:01:55,733 --> 00:01:58,084
So it was barely anyone who knew how bad

25
00:01:58,084 --> 00:02:02,480
I felt, it was only myself who knew.

26
00:02:03,730 --> 00:02:08,147
I have been set in front of Lego instead of

27
00:02:08,147 --> 00:02:11,962
Get to participate in the English and Swedish lessons.

28
00:02:11,962 --> 00:02:15,172
I was too sluggish to be involved.

29
00:02:15,172 --> 00:02:19,362
The worst thing was my teacher wanted me to

30
00:02:19,362 --> 00:02:22,856
Special school.
 It was really the most important thing,

31
00:02:22,856 --> 00:02:26,294
she thought i had some other kind of wrong

32
00:02:26,294 --> 00:02:28,251
I don't know what she really thought.

33
00:02:33,416 --> 00:02:36,641
In the 3-4an, that's when the girls began to be

34
00:02:36,641 --> 00:02:40,612
A little more with the guys.
 And they talked about me

35
00:02:40,612 --> 00:02:46,051
"She's really busy, we don't want to be with her"

36
00:02:46,051 --> 00:02:48,390
and it became such a hard thing for me

37
00:02:48,390 --> 00:02:49,969
that people thought I was hard for I

38
00:02:49,969 --> 00:02:52,742
Wanted to be liked by just about everyone.

39
00:02:54,462 --> 00:03:00,023
So I was lying in the evenings thinking “Ok, tomorrow

40
00:03:00,023 --> 00:03:02,794
Then I'll be normal.
 Tomorrow I can be

41
00:03:02,794 --> 00:03:06,158
normal 'and I decided to be normal

42
00:03:06,158 --> 00:03:10,085
But when it was the next day and I would be

43
00:03:10,085 --> 00:03:17,391
orderly and be calm, then it burst.

44
00:03:17,391 --> 00:03:19,495
And then I felt even more unsuccessful

45
00:03:19,495 --> 00:03:21,509
Because I couldn't do what I had decided.

46
00:03:21,509 --> 00:03:24,914
Inside the lessons I got frozen and on

47
00:03:24,914 --> 00:03:27,887
I was beaten the breaks.

48
00:03:27,887 --> 00:03:32,242
So the whole school was a black hole.

49
00:03:32,242 --> 00:03:38,233
The teachers did not see me.
 They didn't help me.

50
00:03:38,233 --> 00:03:41,607
They were probably only ordinary teachers who thought

51
00:03:41,607 --> 00:03:43,891
That I was an ordinary student.

52
00:03:49,324 --> 00:03:52,188
One of the biggest challenges in my schooling

53
00:03:52,188 --> 00:03:54,573
Have been when I got too big tasks.

54
00:03:54,573 --> 00:03:59,432
If one should choose any country and write

55
00:03:59,432 --> 00:04:02,172
so i have always had a hard time choosing which

56
00:04:02,172 --> 00:04:06,115
Country I will write about, and then get started.

57
00:04:06,115 --> 00:04:08,495
When I get such a great task where man

58
00:04:08,495 --> 00:04:14,782
chooses freely and then should write about something,

59
00:04:14,782 --> 00:04:17,300
Then I just get sitting and don't do anything.

60
00:04:17,300 --> 00:04:20,080
Something more that is difficult are long reviews

61
00:04:20,080 --> 00:04:21,264
and especially on the NO lessons for there

62
00:04:21,264 --> 00:04:24,176
they usually be very long.
 The teacher usually

63
00:04:24,176 --> 00:04:29,600
say very much stuff that doesn't get stuck,

64
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:33,794
It goes into one ear and comes out on the other side

65
00:04:33,794 --> 00:04:37,733
It is extremely difficult.
 I might listen

66
00:04:37,733 --> 00:04:41,295
for a maximum of 10 minutes.
 Then I can't cope anymore.

67
00:04:42,476 --> 00:04:48,031
When our teacher had a review in our subjects,

68
00:04:48,031 --> 00:04:50,638
Especially no and math ... I didn't understand anything

69
00:04:50,638 --> 00:04:53,204
of what she was talking about.
 It was like she

70
00:04:53,204 --> 00:04:56,276
Talked extraterrestrial type.

71
00:04:56,276 --> 00:05:00,887
To let a dyslexic go ahead and read aloud

72
00:05:00,887 --> 00:05:03,534
Or write something on the board, it's really

73
00:05:03,534 --> 00:05:09,532
walked scary like hedging him down in a

74
00:05:09,532 --> 00:05:14,223
Diving equipment with sharks.
 It's so heavenly

75
00:05:14,223 --> 00:05:18,245
Nervous because you can't read aloud that way.

76
00:05:18,575 --> 00:05:21,894
I can't write, I can't spell

77
00:05:21,894 --> 00:05:25,210
In concrete terms, with a regular pen.

78
00:05:25,783 --> 00:05:30,052
In high school it is that you have to choose information.

79
00:05:30,052 --> 00:05:33,953
“Here are 20 tasks and you should choose 5 of them.

80
00:05:33,953 --> 00:05:39,254
No one is more important, you have to choose completely freely. "

81
00:05:39,254 --> 00:05:43,876
Then I think "5, but that's 20?

82
00:05:43,876 --> 00:05:46,772
How can there be 20 if to do 5? "

83
00:05:52,223 --> 00:05:55,014
Something that has been difficult in school for me

84
00:05:55,014 --> 00:05:57,484
is to concentrate on the lessons,

85
00:05:57,484 --> 00:05:59,253
sit still and be quiet.
 I know myself that

86
00:05:59,253 --> 00:06:03,377
it's not possible.
 I can't.
 I can do

87
00:06:03,377 --> 00:06:08,724
It for a maximum of 3 seconds.
 Then I start walking, then

88
00:06:08,724 --> 00:06:11,861
It starts crawling in my legs.
 Can't sit still

89
00:06:11,861 --> 00:06:14,601
Further, then I have to move.
 But it is

90
00:06:14,601 --> 00:06:16,693
many times as i have heard my teachers say

91
00:06:16,693 --> 00:06:21,076
"Sit still and was silent".

92
00:06:21,076 --> 00:06:24,693
When I switched from a smaller school to a larger

93
00:06:24,693 --> 00:06:28,406
Was it hard in the classroom because there was more sound

94
00:06:28,406 --> 00:06:34,443
than in the smaller school.
 The students talked more.

95
00:06:34,443 --> 00:06:37,448
So I had a hard time concentrating

96
00:06:37,448 --> 00:06:38,956
and the teachers did not tell them they would be

97
00:06:38,956 --> 00:06:45,630
silent without the continued as they used to do.

98
00:06:46,411 --> 00:06:48,274
Although it is large or small class so

99
00:06:48,274 --> 00:06:51,157
Is there always something that bothers you.
 For me

100
00:06:51,157 --> 00:06:56,034
has it mostly been big stuff but

101
00:06:56,034 --> 00:06:58,775
there is always something small that can bother me

102
00:06:58,775 --> 00:07:01,705
and I can bother with more than if it

103
00:07:01,705 --> 00:07:04,653
are several talking.
 So then i have always had

104
00:07:04,653 --> 00:07:06,684
trouble concentrating because of

105
00:07:06,684 --> 00:07:08,519
Some sound that bothers me.

106
00:07:08,519 --> 00:07:10,442
Another thing that is very challenging for me

107
00:07:10,442 --> 00:07:13,243
is my concentration.
 It's always been huge

108
00:07:13,243 --> 00:07:17,312
Hard for me.
 Getting a paper ...

109
00:07:17,312 --> 00:07:21,188
while I read, I hear how he farthest

110
00:07:21,188 --> 00:07:24,806
rear goes forward and sharpen his pen and I

111
00:07:24,806 --> 00:07:27,895
counts the yard he sharpen his pen, instead

112
00:07:27,895 --> 00:07:31,003
To read what the headline is.
 And it is not going

113
00:07:31,003 --> 00:07:33,082
because there is so much all around me

114
00:07:33,082 --> 00:07:35,072
My head can't switch on a thing,

115
00:07:35,072 --> 00:07:36,673
It connects in a hundred.

116
00:07:41,354 --> 00:07:44,366
A major challenge in school has been me together

117
00:07:44,366 --> 00:07:46,534
with conflicts.
 It has been very much

118
00:07:46,534 --> 00:07:51,157
that I can't stay on a normal level,

119
00:07:51,157 --> 00:07:53,473
A quiet level.
 Most conflicts I come in

120
00:07:53,473 --> 00:07:55,597
is about injustice.
 That I feel

121
00:07:55,597 --> 00:07:57,504
either undisturbed or that I become

122
00:07:57,504 --> 00:08:00,350
unfairly treated.
 It will be, I don't know,

123
00:08:00,350 --> 00:08:05,097
It gets black when I get angry.
 I'm coming

124
00:08:05,097 --> 00:08:08,535
Hardly remember what I do or what I say.

125
00:08:08,535 --> 00:08:10,712
And then the anxiety comes afterwards instead.

126
00:08:10,712 --> 00:08:13,549
But then when the teacher did not take me after

127
00:08:13,549 --> 00:08:17,605
Then it only got worse, then it was left.

128
00:08:17,605 --> 00:08:20,332
When I look back on my childhood

129
00:08:20,332 --> 00:08:24,687
That it is always me who is the one you blame.

130
00:08:24,687 --> 00:08:30,912
In the second, the third had some children been on and

131
00:08:30,912 --> 00:08:35,182
pushed me down in the ground and hit me

132
00:08:35,182 --> 00:08:38,396
Virtually a whole break.
 But then when I

133
00:08:38,396 --> 00:08:45,279
Came home, the teachers had called my parents

134
00:08:45,279 --> 00:08:52,895
and said that I had started noise while it

135
00:08:52,895 --> 00:08:56,013
were the ones who were doing with me the whole break.

136
00:08:56,013 --> 00:08:58,469
And then I got the blame for something like me

137
00:08:58,469 --> 00:09:02,073
Really hadn't done.
 Why it was so,

138
00:09:02,073 --> 00:09:04,952
It was easy to blame me.
 I was one

139
00:09:04,952 --> 00:09:11,081
a little hyperactive person who wasn't really

140
00:09:11,081 --> 00:09:15,472
like any other.
 A simple victim to blame.

141
00:09:21,549 --> 00:09:24,834
Homework, the worst there is.

142
00:09:24,834 --> 00:09:28,304
I'm enough too tired to make them and

143
00:09:28,304 --> 00:09:31,865
I just shit in them.
 I was just too tired.

144
00:09:31,865 --> 00:09:33,441
When I got home I just wanted to lie down

145
00:09:33,441 --> 00:09:35,115
On the bed and take it easy.

146
00:09:35,115 --> 00:09:39,264
Why should one get homework, the school is for

147
00:09:39,264 --> 00:09:42,952
to learn one and work, why should one then get

148
00:09:42,952 --> 00:09:46,211
Homework to do at home?
 Home is at home,

149
00:09:46,211 --> 00:09:49,681
Not the school.
 So I think that is totally unnecessary

150
00:09:49,681 --> 00:09:52,895
That you get.
 So I don't usually do my homework

151
00:09:52,895 --> 00:09:55,923
If I get some, then I do them in school instead.

152
00:10:01,595 --> 00:10:04,921
A major challenge in school has been to come

153
00:10:04,921 --> 00:10:07,872
Up on the mornings and get away from school.

154
00:10:07,872 --> 00:10:10,681
Often I went up, ate breakfast and

155
00:10:10,681 --> 00:10:13,773
dressed on me but then I felt “no, I

156
00:10:13,773 --> 00:10:17,013
Can't manage "so I went and lay down again.

157
00:10:17,013 --> 00:10:21,452
For I knew the feeling would come to me

158
00:10:21,452 --> 00:10:26,422
will not be able to focus on lessons and

159
00:10:26,422 --> 00:10:29,482
I am behind in school and don't know if I

160
00:10:29,482 --> 00:10:33,489
Will get help for what I need.

161
00:10:33,489 --> 00:10:36,636
Very early in my schooling I noticed that

162
00:10:36,636 --> 00:10:39,363
It was hard to go to school.
 It was

163
00:10:39,363 --> 00:10:41,673
well mostly because I was tired and because

164
00:10:41,673 --> 00:10:44,636
I got up so early so I couldn't cope.

165
00:10:44,636 --> 00:10:46,635
It was hard for everyone, my parents got

166
00:10:46,635 --> 00:10:50,044
almost force me to go to school.
 It was

167
00:10:50,044 --> 00:10:52,713
well only a few times that I really felt

168
00:10:52,713 --> 00:10:56,013
"Yes now we'll take and fix this", then went

169
00:10:56,013 --> 00:10:57,457
that to hell that day and then I felt

170
00:10:57,457 --> 00:10:58,553
Not so anymore.

171
00:11:03,426 --> 00:11:08,205
My dream school is the school I attend now!

172
00:11:08,205 --> 00:11:10,275
It is because it is so good teacher, we have so

173
00:11:10,275 --> 00:11:13,610
Good contact with the teachers.
 They understand how we

174
00:11:13,610 --> 00:11:19,664
Feels and we understand the students.
 Especially in mine

175
00:11:19,664 --> 00:11:24,244
Class we feel like a family.

176
00:11:24,244 --> 00:11:26,865
A really good school for me, that would

177
00:11:26,865 --> 00:11:29,604
be a school that never gets homework.
 Where it

178
00:11:29,604 --> 00:11:32,352
Are there teachers and special educators who are

179
00:11:32,352 --> 00:11:35,897
Trained to help students with ADHD and Asperger.

180
00:11:35,897 --> 00:11:41,001
A good school for me would be ... understanding!

181
00:11:41,001 --> 00:11:43,212
It is not needed so much more than understanding

182
00:11:43,212 --> 00:11:46,013
Because from that, the person knows what to do

183
00:11:46,013 --> 00:11:50,395
Also understand that everyone with my diagnosis ADHD

184
00:11:50,395 --> 00:11:53,895
Not the same, we don't all work the same.

185
00:11:53,895 --> 00:11:59,043
You have to listen, you have to be interested.

186
00:11:59,043 --> 00:12:01,748
The most important thing I would say is that one gets

187
00:12:01,748 --> 00:12:06,076
More unique adaptation.
 It's hard to

188
00:12:06,076 --> 00:12:10,635
individualize teaching for many students

189
00:12:10,635 --> 00:12:13,143
But that is what is needed.

190
00:12:13,143 --> 00:12:15,661
All students sitting in my situation or

191
00:12:15,661 --> 00:12:18,774
Has diagnoses certainly has lots of different

192
00:12:18,774 --> 00:12:22,228
thoughts about their dream school, but I think

193
00:12:22,228 --> 00:12:30,451
that the teachers instead of giving a great task

194
00:12:30,451 --> 00:12:34,181
So they do less tasks for all students directly.

195
00:12:34,181 --> 00:12:39,212
In the school I attend now we have very much

196
00:12:39,212 --> 00:12:43,110
structure.
 We have the same classroom, we sit on

197
00:12:43,110 --> 00:12:45,982
the same place, we have a small sign on our

198
00:12:45,982 --> 00:12:49,335
Bench where it says our names.
 Then writes

199
00:12:49,335 --> 00:12:52,393
the teachers up on a whiteboard what it

200
00:12:52,393 --> 00:12:55,567
is for subject, what time it is, what time

201
00:12:55,567 --> 00:12:58,409
We have a break, what we should do, how to do

202
00:12:58,409 --> 00:13:00,742
And why we should do it.

203
00:13:00,742 --> 00:13:03,572
There should be good instructions.
 Were the classrooms

204
00:13:03,572 --> 00:13:06,531
Located and where to go.
 And clear

205
00:13:06,531 --> 00:13:09,499
Schedules, that would also be good.

206
00:13:09,499 --> 00:13:11,574
Something that helps me in school when it gets

207
00:13:11,574 --> 00:13:14,331
Hard for me is clarity.
 It should be

208
00:13:14,331 --> 00:13:15,757
clearly to me what to do, it will

209
00:13:15,757 --> 00:13:16,879
be clear when it is to be finished and

210
00:13:16,879 --> 00:13:19,985
It should be clear.
 It was well at the beginning

211
00:13:19,985 --> 00:13:21,955
just a teacher who saw that it was actually

212
00:13:21,955 --> 00:13:27,832
Hard for me.
 So when I entered the lesson

213
00:13:27,832 --> 00:13:32,486
so there was a piece of paper at my place where it stands

214
00:13:32,486 --> 00:13:35,317
"Linnea's Schedule", and there stands when the lesson

215
00:13:35,317 --> 00:13:38,704
begins and ends at the top.
 Then stands times,

216
00:13:38,704 --> 00:13:41,644
"10 minutes read, 5 minutes break" and so stood

217
00:13:41,644 --> 00:13:43,057
There is some suggestions on what I could do.

218
00:13:43,057 --> 00:13:44,985
Check the mobile phone, go down to the cafeteria or

219
00:13:44,985 --> 00:13:47,861
What I wanted to do.
 And what time I would

220
00:13:47,861 --> 00:13:51,163
be back.
 This worked so well for me

221
00:13:51,163 --> 00:13:53,102
When it was extremely hard for me before I

222
00:13:53,102 --> 00:13:55,185
Strategies themselves had found.
 That I actually

223
00:13:55,185 --> 00:13:58,633
Got help from someone who saw me.

224
00:13:58,633 --> 00:14:03,316
The teachers should cooperate with the parents as well.

225
00:14:03,316 --> 00:14:08,439
It is good that the parents and teachers have

226
00:14:08,439 --> 00:14:11,271
good contact because then teachers can tell you about it

227
00:14:11,271 --> 00:14:16,730
Is something in school that may affect me.

228
00:14:16,730 --> 00:14:19,410
So they can contact my parents.

229
00:14:19,410 --> 00:14:25,155
In order for a school to work well so it is required

230
00:14:25,155 --> 00:14:30,801
That the teachers really see the problem with the students.

231
00:14:30,801 --> 00:14:32,551
If they see that someone is feeling bad, that they really

232
00:14:32,551 --> 00:14:35,633
Grab it and ask.

233
00:14:35,633 --> 00:14:40,301
Only a hello in the corridor can make a difference.

234
00:14:40,301 --> 00:14:43,663
Prejudice about ADHD, they will be away.

235
00:14:43,663 --> 00:14:45,535
They must not exist.
