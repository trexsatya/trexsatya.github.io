1
00:00:00,067 --> 00:00:01,353
- Should we put the whole in our mouths?
 - The whole.

2
00:00:01,353 --> 00:00:03,009
Oh my God.
 1, 2, 3.

3
00:00:03,234 --> 00:00:05,134
(Harry screams)

4
00:00:05,340 --> 00:00:07,675
It tastes like uncooked pasta, type.

5
00:00:07,842 --> 00:00:09,220
4 out of 5.

6
00:00:09,468 --> 00:00:11,309
Now I am not in the picture.

7
00:00:11,512 --> 00:00:12,780
Zero!

8
00:00:12,947 --> 00:00:15,138
- Zero!
 - Zero!

9
00:00:22,835 --> 00:00:25,645
Hello Hello!

10
00:00:25,793 --> 00:00:30,991
Today we will test sweets from Portugal!

11
00:00:31,966 --> 00:00:38,005
Many people have wanted this particular video since we moved here.

12
00:00:38,339 --> 00:00:42,476
But we have actually made a "test candy from Portugal" before.

13
00:00:42,543 --> 00:00:44,412
Yes, a long time ago.

14
00:00:44,512 --> 00:00:49,758
Then you would have been on a job trip in Madeira and bought with you candy home.

15
00:00:49,758 --> 00:00:50,371
Yes.

16
00:00:50,371 --> 00:00:54,943
Since we moved here, we have noticed that it was not typically Portuguese candy.

17
00:00:54,989 --> 00:00:56,290
- No.
 - No.

18
00:00:56,424 --> 00:01:00,494
- So today we will offer what is typical of Portugal.
 - Yes.

19
00:01:00,661 --> 00:01:04,373
- Or, we should be offered it.
 - Yes.
 We'll test it, simply.

20
00:01:04,532 --> 00:01:07,364
- Yeah!
 Should we start?
 - Yes I think so!

21
00:01:07,668 --> 00:01:09,503
"Flocos de neve"

22
00:01:09,770 --> 00:01:18,001
There are candies in red paper, and they are white.
 "Flocos de neve" means "snowflakes".

23
00:01:18,662 --> 00:01:23,191
No, Laura.
 You must not eat it.
 Not yet.

24
00:01:23,485 --> 00:01:30,463
- Laura sits with a small apple piece while we test sweets.
 - Yes.

25
00:01:31,888 --> 00:01:33,936
- Are you ready?
 - Yes.

26
00:01:34,162 --> 00:01:36,271
Let's go.

27
00:01:39,574 --> 00:01:43,336
- It's good.
 - mm, that's it.

28
00:01:45,213 --> 00:01:49,211
- A little floral in taste.
 - Yes, a fruity taste.

29
00:01:49,550 --> 00:01:57,030
- What, how does a flower taste?
 - Good question.
 But I know how flowers usually smell.

30
00:01:57,618 --> 00:02:01,123
(Laura makes a long cruelty)

31
00:02:02,661 --> 00:02:09,207
- Laura likes her apple.
 - She just: "Apple is better than candy."

32
00:02:09,634 --> 00:02:16,663
We rate every candy we test on a scale from 1 to 5. Who wants to start?

33
00:02:16,867 --> 00:02:19,006
- I.
 - Okay.

34
00:02:19,173 --> 00:02:22,313
I give this little caramel ...

35
00:02:23,587 --> 00:02:25,679
... 4 out of 5 points.

36
00:02:25,859 --> 00:02:30,999
- Oh, what a loud!
 - mm.
 It was delicious, I think.

37
00:02:31,392 --> 00:02:34,667
3 points, I think.

38
00:02:35,656 --> 00:02:39,026
2 points I give because I don't think it was great fun.

39
00:02:39,126 --> 00:02:45,003
I wouldn't buy it, but totally okay if you were to get it for free on a bank, type.

40
00:02:45,342 --> 00:02:47,501
On a bank?

41
00:02:47,671 --> 00:02:53,458
- Isn't that where they usually have free candies?
 - It's a little bank candy, you are right in that. Standing in a large glass bowl.

42
00:02:53,507 --> 00:02:57,511
- I think I change my to 3 as well.
 - Okay.

43
00:02:57,678 --> 00:03:03,217
I also give it 3 strong.
 It was good, but ... it is enough with one or two.

44
00:03:03,284 --> 00:03:06,186
- "Banking".
 - good, but “bankig”

45
00:03:06,534 --> 00:03:10,491
If you notice that the light in this video changes ...

46
00:03:10,594 --> 00:03:14,687
- Now I'm not in the picture.
 - Now you are in the picture.

47
00:03:14,995 --> 00:03:22,503
... so it is because the sun is going down and we try to set the light so it will match all the time.

48
00:03:22,638 --> 00:03:28,075
But it can make the light jump a little now and then.
 Hope you stand out with it.

49
00:03:28,175 --> 00:03:29,297
Sorry for that.

50
00:03:29,523 --> 00:03:31,845
"Regina's chocolate umbrellas"

51
00:03:32,334 --> 00:03:35,762
This is what it looks like inside the paper.

52
00:03:36,214 --> 00:03:41,302
In Portugal it doesn't seem to rain that much.
 This is their definition of umbrellas.

53
00:03:41,641 --> 00:03:43,642
- Shall we drive?
 - Yes.

54
00:03:43,958 --> 00:03:46,794
- I still have my other candy.
 - huh?!

55
00:03:46,961 --> 00:03:50,808
- (Axel) Do you have the other one?
 - Here.

56
00:03:51,192 --> 00:03:53,730
- But me ... - Well!

57
00:03:54,535 --> 00:03:59,807
It's the crazy corner over there.
 I don't know what they are doing.
 I've already tasted.

58
00:03:59,873 --> 00:04:02,086
Yes, now we drive.

59
00:04:04,133 --> 00:04:10,684
- I have to eat more!
 - It tastes like the chocolate you get in Advent Christmas calendars.

60
00:04:10,825 --> 00:04:12,953
- Yes.
 - Exactly like the one.

61
00:04:13,020 --> 00:04:16,206
- Pretty good.
 - A little better than the one.

62
00:04:16,206 --> 00:04:19,293
I agree with.
 Like Milko, or ...

63
00:04:19,426 --> 00:04:24,766
- Yes, Milka!
 - Although it is actually better than this one.

64
00:04:25,060 --> 00:04:30,337
I liked that you don't have to hold the chocolate.
 You can hold the small umbrella hook.

65
00:04:30,458 --> 00:04:33,066
Yes, it was actually najs.

66
00:04:33,857 --> 00:04:35,244
Like a chocolate club.

67
00:04:39,446 --> 00:04:41,514
What are you doing?

68
00:04:41,815 --> 00:04:48,001
He shoots me with the umbrella.
 A candy that can be used in many ways.

69
00:04:48,431 --> 00:04:54,324
I like the aftertaste on this one, so I give it 5 points.

70
00:04:54,528 --> 00:04:56,874
- 5 points?!
 - huh?!
 5 out of 5?

71
00:04:56,964 --> 00:04:58,193
Wow.

72
00:04:58,578 --> 00:05:02,117
I give this 2 out of 5. (Laura says "Aaaah")

73
00:05:02,366 --> 00:05:05,583
I wished it was a little more fun.
 (Laura says "Aaaah")

74
00:05:05,583 --> 00:05:06,998
(Harry laughs)

75
00:05:07,314 --> 00:05:14,316
- Sorry, Laura is so fun.
 She just ... (aaah) - she sits and sings in her microphone there.

76
00:05:14,610 --> 00:05:20,913
- She just: "Is it on?"
 - She steals our show.

77
00:05:21,568 --> 00:05:27,688
- What do you give?
 - 3 points.
 The chocolate was good, and I liked the umbrella thing.

78
00:05:28,073 --> 00:05:30,154
I also give 3 points.

79
00:05:30,617 --> 00:05:32,621
“Gelatina Banana”

80
00:05:32,866 --> 00:05:40,143
It's a darer's dessert -like ... gel?
 Jello?
 Do you say that?

81
00:05:40,143 --> 00:05:41,476
(Alma) Yes.
 Jello.

82
00:05:41,476 --> 00:05:44,011
And it is available in lots of different flavors.

83
00:05:49,264 --> 00:05:53,300
It tastes like the foam track, though in another form.

84
00:05:53,504 --> 00:05:55,542
- mm.
 - Yes.

85
00:05:55,689 --> 00:05:59,059
- But it's not that sweet.
 - No, not as sweet as the foam track.

86
00:05:59,111 --> 00:06:00,956
Though a little worse.

87
00:06:00,961 --> 00:06:04,727
- Oh, Laura is so hungry.
 - Do you want to taste a little?

88
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:09,759
- She got nothing.
 - Was it good?

89
00:06:09,937 --> 00:06:11,508
Well, she had to lick it a bit.

90
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:16,010
It is a very "childish" taste of this one.

91
00:06:16,327 --> 00:06:21,682
It feels like something you offer to a bad children's party.

92
00:06:21,849 --> 00:06:25,908
- "On a bad children's party."
 - "Here you get instead of cake. Please eat. Eat."

93
00:06:25,986 --> 00:06:28,555
Okay, then we'll not serve these.

94
00:06:28,633 --> 00:06:34,529
- Harry, you have a history of liking these Jellograys.
 - Yes, but this wasn't my Jello.

95
00:06:34,695 --> 00:06:39,131
It wasn't your Jello, this.
 No.
 There is a difference between Jello and Jello.

96
00:06:39,402 --> 00:06:41,001
Yes.

97
00:06:41,544 --> 00:06:44,044
I give 1 point.

98
00:06:44,338 --> 00:06:47,155
Me too.
 1 point.

99
00:06:47,508 --> 00:06:51,512
- 0 of 0. - I also give 0.

100
00:06:52,015 --> 00:06:53,610
“Pipocas Doces”

101
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,712
So it's cute popcorn.

102
00:07:00,119 --> 00:07:02,119
(Axel) Oh, what cute.

103
00:07:04,864 --> 00:07:07,361
- Pretty good.
 - Nah-ä.

104
00:07:07,483 --> 00:07:10,569
- I prefer salty popcorn.
 - Me too.

105
00:07:10,631 --> 00:07:14,067
- I've never taken this.
 - Cute popcorn?
 Nah.

106
00:07:14,175 --> 00:07:16,136
I've taken it.

107
00:07:16,276 --> 00:07:18,175
- Do you like it?
 - Yes.

108
00:07:18,605 --> 00:07:22,185
I give 3 out of 5.

109
00:07:23,474 --> 00:07:28,029
I give 1.8 out of 5.

110
00:07:28,255 --> 00:07:31,506
- Oh.
 Okay.
 - Specifically.

111
00:07:31,710 --> 00:07:36,523
- I give this zero score.
 - I also give ♪ zero ... ♪

112
00:07:36,690 --> 00:07:39,026
- ♪ Zero!
 ♪ - ♪ Zero!
 ♪

113
00:07:39,193 --> 00:07:42,453
What do you usually do?
 This is how ... ♪ zero!

114
00:07:42,529 --> 00:07:45,032

 Everything is zero!

115
00:07:45,199 --> 00:07:47,582
- And Laura only ... - Pipita's head is zero!

116
00:07:47,582 --> 00:07:49,356
- She takes nothing.
 - No.

117
00:07:49,356 --> 00:07:51,079
Her eyes are zero.

118
00:07:51,396 --> 00:07:53,017
"Tras Ácidas"

119
00:07:53,273 --> 00:07:57,757
There are thus sour small rubber nodes in different colors.

120
00:08:02,247 --> 00:08:05,355
- It wasn't so angry.
 - No.

121
00:08:05,561 --> 00:08:07,353
It's sugar on it.

122
00:08:07,711 --> 00:08:10,729
It tastes like uncooked pasta, type.

123
00:08:12,336 --> 00:08:16,196
- It's the same texture.
 - Very boring texture.

124
00:08:16,518 --> 00:08:23,003
So ... This feels like such a candy ... that parents buy-

125
00:08:23,337 --> 00:08:30,327
-When their children should have a masquerade party where they will dress up as the princess and Batmans.

126
00:08:30,546 --> 00:08:33,971
Then this is the candy that is in the candy bags.

127
00:08:34,378 --> 00:08:38,945
- I give 2 points.
 - I give 3 points.

128
00:08:39,241 --> 00:08:45,534
- I give 2 points.
 - I thought it was unassuming and useless.
 I give it noool ...

129
00:08:45,692 --> 00:08:47,648
- Zero!
 - ...point.

"Bem Me Quer"

132
00:08:52,835 --> 00:09:00,245
It's chocolate chocolates ... filled with liqueur.

133
00:09:00,901 --> 00:09:07,929
- Laura got enough and wanted to sit with me instead.
 - She probably wanted to sit with anyone, just not in her chair.

134
00:09:08,065 --> 00:09:12,519
No.
 She just wants to sit with me because I'm calm and safe.

135
00:09:12,686 --> 00:09:20,027
Soon she will surely want to move down on the floor and clear around.
 We'll see how long she pallets to sit here.

136
00:09:20,193 --> 00:09:23,030
She will be like King Kong.

137
00:09:23,196 --> 00:09:26,166
Are you ready?
 King Kong ...

138
00:09:26,328 --> 00:09:27,192
I'm ready.

139
00:09:27,192 --> 00:09:28,802
- I'm ready.
 - I'm ready.

140
00:09:28,835 --> 00:09:30,101
- Should we put the whole in our mouths?
 - The whole.

141
00:09:30,101 --> 00:09:33,212
Oh my God.
 1, 2, 3 ...

142
00:09:33,619 --> 00:09:36,520
You cheat!

143
00:09:37,154 --> 00:09:42,754
- Look at Alma.
 She made the worst scream.
 - Mmm, what good.

144
00:09:43,703 --> 00:09:47,580
(Alma screams and harrows) What are you doing?

145
00:09:51,313 --> 00:09:55,123
We have a trash can ... oh.

146
00:09:57,986 --> 00:10:02,723
Running!
 (Harry screams and spits)

147
00:10:04,123 --> 00:10:07,607
The name, do not run and spit!

148
00:10:07,797 --> 00:10:13,146
- I had to ... - it's very ... Likörig.

149
00:10:13,319 --> 00:10:16,483
- A lot of liquor.
 - It just really ran out.

150
00:10:16,616 --> 00:10:23,023
Yes.
 And so it's like a cherry inside, with some chewing resistance ..

151
00:10:23,190 --> 00:10:26,818
This one was probably one of the worst we have ever tested, I think.

152
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:29,429
It is non -alcoholic.

153
00:10:29,701 --> 00:10:32,880
(Alma and Harry Frustar and Milling)

154
00:10:33,086 --> 00:10:38,004
- What is this?
 - So, that one was so disgusting and strong.

155
00:10:38,171 --> 00:10:40,474
- Yes, so ... - Who wants to eat this?

156
00:10:40,540 --> 00:10:48,000
May I only say one thing?
 It feels like you have to have the worst leather tongue to think this is wonderful to eat.

157
00:10:48,220 --> 00:10:54,245
It's like drinking hand spirit.
 No, Fy!
 It was so disgusting.

158
00:10:54,536 --> 00:10:58,358
- I give noool ... - I also give zero.

00:11:09,669 --> 00:11:14,416

163
00:11:14,823 --> 00:11:19,666
"Will Hussein ..." (Laura screams)

164
00:11:19,885 --> 00:11:24,634
Oh really?
 Do you say that?
 I agree with.

165
00:11:24,815 --> 00:11:28,147
"Will Hussein come and visit you in Portugal?"

166
00:11:28,288 --> 00:11:32,677
- Yes!
 Yes!
 Yes!
 - Yes!
 Yes!
 Yes!

167
00:11:32,859 --> 00:11:40,200
We really hope so.
 We are trying to find a sensible opportunity for him to come.

168
00:11:40,367 --> 00:11:43,262
I can tell you a great fun thing.
 He has taken ...

169
00:11:43,443 --> 00:11:46,129
(Axel + Alma + Harry) Driving license!

170
00:11:46,273 --> 00:11:50,510
- Home in Sweden.
 We are so happy and proud!
 - Yes.

171
00:11:50,677 --> 00:11:52,184
Hooray for Hussein!

172
00:11:52,345 --> 00:11:54,898
"Sugus Laranja"

173
00:11:55,286 --> 00:11:57,976
There are small fruit schools.

174
00:12:02,578 --> 00:12:07,508
- Strong orange flavor.
 - mm.
 Like Maoam.

175
00:12:07,661 --> 00:12:15,626
Yes exactly!
 Laura is a huge departure.
 She also wants to taste.
 She doesn't get that.

176
00:12:18,204 --> 00:12:22,645
She just: "I'm King Kong!"
 (Raaawr)

177
00:12:23,086 --> 00:12:26,492
(Raawr) "I'm King Kong!"
 (Rawr!)

178
00:12:26,980 --> 00:12:30,183
It tastes like a very common orange fruit covers.

179
00:12:30,350 --> 00:12:31,778
- Yes.
 - mm.

180
00:12:31,852 --> 00:12:37,785
As you get at a nail salon when you come with mom when she has a little time off.

181
00:12:37,969 --> 00:12:42,001
So, I love your descriptions today.

182
00:12:42,362 --> 00:12:49,336
The bank and the nail salon.
 You have really been around the city, you.

183
00:12:49,502 --> 00:12:54,608
- And on Batman and Princess.
 - Yes.
 Jaws candy everywhere.

184
00:12:54,774 --> 00:13:04,177
- (Joanna) Laura thinks we should give points.
 - Okay.
 I give the orange singy ... 2 points.

185
00:13:04,539 --> 00:13:06,019
4 points.

186
00:13:06,192 --> 00:13:11,573
(A bargain sound heard) It wasn't me who bargained.
 It was Laura's foot.

187
00:13:11,705 --> 00:13:15,795
- 5 points out of 5!
 - Oooh, a fifth!

188
00:13:15,962 --> 00:13:17,954
Oops!

189
00:13:18,932 --> 00:13:20,688
I give 2 points.

190
00:13:20,867 --> 00:13:25,665
"Solano Café Espresso" "its Azúcar"

191
00:13:26,050 --> 00:13:29,676
It is a small sugar -free coffee caramel.

192
00:13:29,935 --> 00:13:35,015
- This sounds like something to me.
 - Mm, really.

193
00:13:35,186 --> 00:13:36,349
It smells good.

194
00:13:36,516 --> 00:13:40,020
- No, it smells very vast.
 - Oh, it smells of coffee.

195
00:13:40,186 --> 00:13:45,333
- Eww, do you think this smells good?
 - Yes, and I don't even like coffee.
 Here we go!

196
00:13:45,333 --> 00:13:46,860
YES!

197
00:13:47,074 --> 00:13:51,865
- I refuse.
 I haven't taken it!
 - Fuskis!

198
00:13:52,032 --> 00:13:53,393
- Yes.
 - You must.

199
00:13:53,393 --> 00:13:56,777
- You must.
 - It wasn't so horrible.

200
00:14:01,132 --> 00:14:02,386
(Harry) eww.

201
00:14:02,601 --> 00:14:10,381
Yes, it was a tough taste, that is.
 Like coffee that has been in a cup for a long time.

202
00:14:10,675 --> 00:14:14,823
It is enough that it lacks sugar.

203
00:14:15,166 --> 00:14:19,025
- Reminds me of the teacher's breath ... - No, but five!

204
00:14:19,192 --> 00:14:23,697
... in middle school when asked for help, the teacher came after lunch and just ...

205
00:14:23,878 --> 00:14:27,367
"Yes, Axel."
 (breathe heavily)

206
00:14:27,701 --> 00:14:30,309
Man just ...

207
00:14:30,603 --> 00:14:34,073
It tasted disappointment.

208
00:14:34,341 --> 00:14:39,687
I give 0 points.
 Zero come zero come zero come zero come zero one.

209
00:14:39,981 --> 00:14:43,516
- Oh!
 - come zero one?
 Okay.

210
00:14:43,683 --> 00:14:47,302
- So it got some points, at least?
 - A little.

211
00:14:47,561 --> 00:14:51,191
I give this 0 points.
 Nothing for me.

212
00:14:51,372 --> 00:14:57,461
I give 1 point because it was sugar free.
 It gets a small bonus because of it.

213
00:14:57,968 --> 00:15:04,170
- ♪ Zero, zero, zero, zero!
 ♪ - ♪ zero, zero, zero, zero!
 ♪

214
00:15:04,337 --> 00:15:05,527
Ouch.

215
00:15:05,527 --> 00:15:11,845
♪ Alma's face is like a zero!
 Check out her feud!
 ♪

216
00:15:12,011 --> 00:15:18,518
♪ And her eye is like a zero!
 And pipitas, and dad and middle and mom!
 Everything is like a zero!
 ♪

217
00:15:18,685 --> 00:15:20,520
Help!

218
00:15:20,687 --> 00:15:25,420
- Oh my God.
 - I don't know what's going on here now.

219
00:15:25,782 --> 00:15:28,444
"Dr. Bentes Peitoral"

220
00:15:28,783 --> 00:15:30,864
These are hard candies.

221
00:15:31,435 --> 00:15:34,701
- It tastes a little unique.
 - I recognize the taste.

222
00:15:34,868 --> 00:15:39,840
- Yes, from another candy.
 - It's a little Greek ouzo ... caramel.

223
00:15:40,107 --> 00:15:43,510
(Harry) It gets type ... (Caramels fall in the floor)

224
00:15:43,676 --> 00:15:49,042
Laura has really tired of this.
 Should we try chewing on it?

225
00:15:49,182 --> 00:15:52,227
- Yes.
 - Okay.

226
00:15:53,335 --> 00:15:54,577
(Axel) Aah ...

227
00:15:54,577 --> 00:15:57,532
- (Harry) aj, my tooth!
 - Did it break?

228
00:15:57,690 --> 00:15:59,359
- (Alma) Yes.
 - huh?

229
00:15:59,468 --> 00:16:03,317
- It's the same thing inside.
 - Yes, but the tooth did not break?

230
00:16:03,317 --> 00:16:05,532
Well!
 No.

231
00:16:05,738 --> 00:16:10,972
Check out this baby!
 This has really "freaked out".
 I'm sorry, the viewers.

232
00:16:11,247 --> 00:16:17,010
You know when you kind of should ... accompany his friend's dad to work with his friend,-

233
00:16:17,177 --> 00:16:19,846
-and the friend's dad is a broker ...

234
00:16:20,013 --> 00:16:25,263
It tastes like the caramel they offer there.
 Exactly like that!

235
00:16:25,557 --> 00:16:28,620
- Very boring caramel.
 - Yes.

236
00:16:28,620 --> 00:16:30,190
- Blä.
 - Yes.

237
00:16:30,290 --> 00:16:35,371
- That was the most specific description of sweets ... of all.
 - Yes.

238
00:16:35,528 --> 00:16:39,866
I will actually give it 2 points anyway.

239
00:16:40,042 --> 00:16:43,147
- 2 points?
 Okay.
 - Oh!
 I give 1 point.

240
00:16:43,438 --> 00:16:45,161
- Alma?
 - 1 point.

241
00:16:45,297 --> 00:16:46,130
1 point.

242
00:16:46,272 --> 00:16:49,843
This was the last candy we had today.

243
00:16:50,095 --> 00:16:54,380
The sun is going down.
 We have a lovely orange color on the face.

244
00:16:54,553 --> 00:16:56,968
Laura is "all over the place".

245
00:16:57,350 --> 00:17:03,356
Thanks for watching this video!

246
00:17:03,523 --> 00:17:08,689
- Feel free to leave a thumbs up, or down.
 - Most thumbs up!

247
00:17:09,028 --> 00:17:15,503
Comment, ask questions and have a great time until we see you next time!

248
00:17:15,668 --> 00:17:18,671
Bye!
