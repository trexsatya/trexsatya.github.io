1
00:00:00,400 --> 00:00:04,160
Slept you smarter.
 Yes, you heard right.

2
00:00:04,320 --> 00:00:09,760
If you sleep enough hours you can become smarter-

3
00:00:09,920 --> 00:00:15,520
-Sterson sleep affects your learning and your performance.

4
00:00:15,680 --> 00:00:18,280
But why do we sleep?

5
00:00:18,440 --> 00:00:23,160
You could say that sleep is the price of being awake.

6
00:00:23,320 --> 00:00:29,880
When we are awake, the brain works too full and exposed to impress-

7
00:00:30,040 --> 00:00:32,440
-Get if it doesn't want to.

8
00:00:32,600 --> 00:00:36,760
Sleep is the chance of the body and brain to recharge-

9
00:00:36,920 --> 00:00:41,960
-To cope with the next day and learn new things.

10
00:00:42,120 --> 00:00:48,200
Sleep is one as a superpower, which maximizes your brain in different ways.

11
00:00:52,040 --> 00:00:57,640
During sleep, impressions and information are sorted and processed.

12
00:00:57,800 --> 00:01:03,920
What is important is moved from short -term memory to long -term memory.

13
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:11,080
You help the brain to save by repeating info during the day-

14
00:01:11,240 --> 00:01:14,120
-For example, glosses.

15
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:21,480
When we sleep, the memory is reinforced, and the information is saved.

16
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:30,040
Your brain is like a hard drive.
 The information that is unimportant-

17
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:34,920
-Raded away so new information can fit.

18
00:01:35,080 --> 00:01:39,640
It formed junk substances in the brain, which need to be cleaned away-

19
00:01:39,800 --> 00:01:43,840
-To the brain works optimally.

20
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:51,520
In the dream sleep, hard feelings are dramatized from the day.

21
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:56,240
It lets you handle them better and get into balance.

22
00:01:56,400 --> 00:02:00,680
You get better concentration as you focus better-

23
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:03,680
-and not controlled by impulses.

24
00:02:07,640 --> 00:02:10,640
In the dream sleep, the creativity-

25
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:15,480
-Do that the brain opens up and associates freely.

26
00:02:15,640 --> 00:02:20,720
Old and new memories are connected.
 Then the brain looks context-

27
00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:24,080
-And comes on solutions and ideas.

28
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:28,000
You've probably heard the phrase "to sleep on the thing".

29
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:33,520
But for it to work, you have to get enough sleep.

30
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:36,960
Teens need at least eight hours.

31
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:43,840
Sleep has cycles in 90-120 minutes.
 Each bike has four different sleep phases-

32
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:47,320
-What are equally important to the brain.

33
00:02:47,480 --> 00:02:54,680
We need to sleep through a number of sleep cycles for a complete sleep.

34
00:02:54,840 --> 00:03:00,200
As important as getting enough sleep is sleep quality.

35
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:07,800
To get good quality of sleep, ie with all the important phases-

36
00:03:07,960 --> 00:03:12,960
-To start we follow a natural daily rhythm.
 The biological clock

37
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:18,000
-As set to sleep at night and be awake during the day.

38
00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:22,840
Turning around the day impairs sleep and body processes.

39
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:26,280
It provides worse health and performance.

40
00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:29,520
Tips for better sleep:

41
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:33,440
Have as dark and cool as possible in the bedroom.

42
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:36,640
Preferably do nothing in bed than to sleep.

43
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:41,760
The brain is associative, so it connects the bed to sleep.

44
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:48,400
Was out a lot in daylight.
 It makes you sleepier in the evening.

45
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:53,120
Avoid the mobile or computer before sleeping.

46
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:58,400
The blue light of the mobile and screens makes the brain believe it is day.

47
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:02,280
Be out in daylight because it compensates-

48
00:04:02,440 --> 00:04:06,240
-and suppresses the effects of blue light.

49
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:13,440
Set the screen to night mode.
 Then it gets a yellow, warmer light.

50
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:16,200
Sleep tight!
