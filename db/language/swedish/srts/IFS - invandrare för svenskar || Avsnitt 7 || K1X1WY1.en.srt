00:00:04.600 --> 00:00:08.920
In tonight's section of Ifs, immigrants for Swedes:

2
00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:11.920
The world's Swedish Arab: Elaf Ali.

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:15.080
Rinkeby's own Harry Potter: Daniel Sanchez.

4
00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:18.760
Cremiest woman on Instagram: Afrobellas.

5
00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:22.320
Sweden's second best celebrity dancer: Filip Dikmen.

6
00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:24.680
Greek from Alby: Thanos Fotas.

7
00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:28.760
Gothenburg's best Somalis: Assia Dahir.

Sweden's most fun Chinese: Evelyn Mok.

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:42.800
The cheeky Melodifestival bird: Farah Abadi.

12
00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:48.920
And last, but not least, our incredible program manager: Ahmed Berhan!

13
00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:51.840
Welcome to IFS.

14
00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.880
The program that will definitely have public service closed.

15
00:00:56.120 --> 00:01:01.000
My name is Ahmed Berhan.
 You see the quiz about all culture in Sweden.

16
00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:08.880
A large applause to today's competitors: Linda, Martin and Elsa.

17
00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:17.880
A competitor chooses one in the panel that I ask another question.

18
00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:23.160
Then the contestant can decide whether the panelist is lying or not.

19
00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:27.000
The two with the most points make it to the final.

20
00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:33.240
We drew who would start.

21
00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:39.840
The happy was no less than you, Martin.
 Who do you want to talk to?

22
00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:43.080
I want to talk to Mustafa.

23
00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:50.160
Does it feel good?
 I have a nice question.
 We have heard of Bar Mitzva.

24
00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:59.320
Judaism is a tolerant religion.
 When you get into it it is celebrated.

25
00:01:59.480 --> 00:02:04.920
But even if you leave, it's a ceremony, and it's Bat Mitzva.

26
00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:10.520
- What do you say, Martin?
 -No.

27
00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:13.680
Bullshit.

28
00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:18.720
- Did you know what a Bat Mitzva is?
 -No.

29
00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:25.280
- You just don't trust black skulls.
 - You will say no to everyone.

30
00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:28.200
You know what?
 Sure it's bullshit.

31
00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:34.320
Bat Mitzva is really not the Jewish login -

32
00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:38.760
- Without a bar Mitzva, but for girls.

33
00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:42.320
You could, Linda?
 Heavy you are.

34
00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:46.160
- Next competitors.
 Elsa, ready?
 -Yes.

35
00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:51.120
- Who do you choose to talk to?
 –Evelyn.

36
00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:59.760
Jan Guillou is coming!

37
00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:04.000
Fill the buffet.
 Jan loves China Buffet.

38
00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:10.560
No, but Gwailou ... I don't want to reveal it, but should.

39
00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:17.400
It is a racist expression that we Chinese use.

40
00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:21.520
We use it on The Whites.

41
00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:24.840
We call white people Gwailou.

42
00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:30.360
It means ghost head, if you translate it verbatim.

43
00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:33.960
True or false?
 Do you believe in Evelyn?

44
00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:39.880
I felt confidence in you, but I say it is false.

45
00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:42.200
- Is it false?
 -Yes.

46
00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:49.400
Typically gwailou.
 You should have trusted her, because that's just right.

47
00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:53.680
- Ssorry, Elsa!
 - It's just like Evelyn said.

48
00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:59.960
It means ghost head, which is probably the cutest racist word.

49
00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:03.120
You need to work on your racist terms.

50
00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:09.160
You should know what we call Black People.
 Codejo.

51
00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:14.200
Everyone is Kodjo Akolor.

52
00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:20.080
- Linda, are you with?
 How does it feel?
 - Giantbra.

53
00:04:20.240 --> 00:04:24.680
- You knew the questions.
 You nodded.
 - I teach me something.

54
00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:29.880
- If I couldn't, I can now.
 -Good attitude.

55
00:04:30.040 --> 00:04:34.440
- What do you want to talk to?
 –Afrobellas.

56
00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:39.280
Afrobellas?
 My question to you is:

57
00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:48.240
Many Swedes live there.

58
00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:52.680
They have Swedish schools, Swedish grocery stores ...

59
00:04:52.840 --> 00:04:58.360
But the Spaniards began to get tired of Swedish youth -

60
00:04:58.520 --> 00:05:03.480
- Because they committed crime and did not learn the language.

61
00:05:03.640 --> 00:05:08.160
That's why they started calling them fucking white skulls.

62
00:05:08.320 --> 00:05:10.400
I can confirm that.

63
00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:13.640
-Wind?
 - I think it's false.

64
00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:18.840
I haven't heard of it.
 It is pensioners who live there.

65
00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:25.240
- No young people.
 So, false.
 - But you know of town?

66
00:05:25.400 --> 00:05:30.200
- Did you know what the worst is?
 You are wrong.
 -Aah!

67
00:05:30.360 --> 00:05:36.480
- The city has had that problem.
 -In the 40s, or?

68
00:05:36.640 --> 00:05:40.720
A documentary was released ten years ago about the problem.

69
00:05:40.880 --> 00:05:47.160
- They have Swedish homeless people there too.
 - Unfortunately, Linda.
 No point.

70
00:05:47.320 --> 00:05:52.000
On to the next.
 Only Martin has managed to collect one point.

71
00:05:52.160 --> 00:05:55.080
Do you think you get one more?

72
00:05:55.240 --> 00:05:59.400
- What of the chews are you going to chew with?
 - Farah.
 Skåne in between.

73
00:05:59.560 --> 00:06:04.800
Skåne represents.
 - Farah?
 What is the largest immigrant group in Malmö?

74
00:06:04.960 --> 00:06:07.920
Paperless.

75
00:06:09.880 --> 00:06:13.160
No.
 The Öresund Bridge opened 20 years ago.

76
00:06:13.320 --> 00:06:17.520
Since then, Danes are the largest immigrant group.

77
00:06:17.680 --> 00:06:23.080
It is cheap to live in Sweden and work in Denmark.

78
00:06:23.240 --> 00:06:28.920
- Martin, like Fellow Scania?
 -No.
 You're lying.

79
00:06:29.080 --> 00:06:33.400
- I think you are lying.
 - Serve a better answer, then.

80
00:06:33.560 --> 00:06:37.400
Can not.
 Then it becomes too racist.

81
00:06:39.560 --> 00:06:43.680
- See it, Martin.
 - Martin has counted.

82
00:06:43.840 --> 00:06:48.680
He stands with a clock.
 I've seen him on the streets.

83
00:06:48.840 --> 00:06:53.440
Martin, you are doing absolutely right.
 It's definitely a lie.

84
00:06:57.040 --> 00:07:03.080
Danes are the third largest immigrant group in Malmö.
 First are Iraqis.

85
00:07:03.240 --> 00:07:05.640
Yeah!

86
00:07:05.800 --> 00:07:11.960
- fun that the only Iraqi applauded.
 - For everyone else is in Skåne.

87
00:07:14.720 --> 00:07:19.520
No. 1: Iraqis, No. 2: Syrians and No. 3: Danes.
 Thanks so much.

88
00:07:19.680 --> 00:07:24.440
Elsa, your turn to drive.
 Come on.
 You have it.

89
00:07:24.600 --> 00:07:29.280
Not Filip.
 I run my Fellow Gothenburg citizen Assia.

90
00:07:29.440 --> 00:07:33.520
- My fucking sweetheart.
 --Assia?

91
00:07:42.600 --> 00:07:47.640
Two young girls in Gothenburg started an anonymous instakonto -

92
00:07:47.800 --> 00:07:53.160
- Where they hung out hundreds of guys and girls and called them -

93
00:07:53.320 --> 00:07:58.920
- "Horor, Orrar, they suck cock behind McDonald's for cheeseburger."

94
00:07:59.080 --> 00:08:02.160
The last one I was.
 But...

95
00:08:02.320 --> 00:08:07.720
That's what they did.
 They end-shameed a lot of people.

96
00:08:07.880 --> 00:08:12.280
I don't have to say anything.
 I trust her.

97
00:08:12.440 --> 00:08:18.440
- You do that right. That's right.
 --Assia, it went for you.

98
00:08:18.600 --> 00:08:23.280
031, 031!
 OOOH-OH!

99
00:08:23.440 --> 00:08:28.600
This happened in 2012. The account was obviously Gbgsorroz.

100
00:08:28.760 --> 00:08:33.360
And the person behind, it was Paolo Roberto.

101
00:08:34.600 --> 00:08:36.720
Congratulations, you got your first point.

102
00:08:36.880 --> 00:08:43.320
Linda, time to jump into the match.
 Are you ready?
 Who do you take?

103
00:08:43.480 --> 00:08:46.640
Lets see.
 I take Filip.

104
00:08:46.800 --> 00:08:49.720
Thanks!
 Finally.

105
00:08:51.840 --> 00:08:53.920
Don't disappoint me now.

106
00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:06.040
His name is Ali.
 His Swedish parents thought it was a nice name.

107
00:09:06.200 --> 00:09:09.920
- Can you say the name again?
 - He was named Ali.

108
00:09:10.080 --> 00:09:13.080
/Panel pronounces it in different ways/

109
00:09:13.240 --> 00:09:17.120
The pronunciation depends on who pronounces it.

110
00:09:17.280 --> 00:09:22.200
His ethnic Swedish parents thought it was an excellent name.

111
00:09:24.680 --> 00:09:29.440
What is difficult?
 Do you mean the name is ugly?

112
00:09:29.600 --> 00:09:36.200
I don't know his name, but it feels like a gear.

113
00:09:36.360 --> 00:09:40.560
Or he was called Ali because it's a nice name.

114
00:09:40.720 --> 00:09:45.920
-I do not believe that.
 -Not?

115
00:09:46.600 --> 00:09:49.280
-Wind!
 –Sorry.

116
00:09:49.440 --> 00:09:53.360
Filip didn't actually lie.
 The actor is named Ali Alarik.

117
00:09:53.520 --> 00:09:58.880
- I never forget his face.
 - I tried to be honest anyway.

118
00:09:59.040 --> 00:10:03.040
Better luck next time.
 Let's move on.
 - Martin?

119
00:10:03.200 --> 00:10:08.120
–2 out of 2. Should we see if it will be 3?
 - I hope so.

120
00:10:08.280 --> 00:10:12.560
- What do you choose?
 - Victor, my man.

121
00:10:17.160 --> 00:10:21.120
Victor?
 As you know yourself, placed words.

122
00:10:21.280 --> 00:10:25.280
For technical reasons I can't answer it, but drive.

123
00:10:30.280 --> 00:10:33.080
You fly with Ryan Air.

124
00:10:35.520 --> 00:10:40.920
Joking aside, at the time when working with youth crime -

125
00:10:41.080 --> 00:10:44.160
- You chose to fix fat boats -

126
00:10:44.320 --> 00:10:48.440
–And take the youngsters to ... yes, South America -

127
00:10:48.600 --> 00:10:54.080
- So they had to remove their criminal aura.

128
00:10:54.920 --> 00:10:58.960
He said with his most criminal voice.

129
00:11:00.720 --> 00:11:08.080
True.
 They sent worst to other countries.
 Especially South America.

130
00:11:08.240 --> 00:11:13.160
No reason to pull it out.
 3 of 3. Congratulations!

131
00:11:17.720 --> 00:11:20.600
For those of you who are not familiar with the phenomenon:

132
00:11:20.760 --> 00:11:25.600
The social let criminal youth work on sailboat trips.

133
00:11:25.760 --> 00:11:29.280
- It went both well and badly.
 - It went very badly.

134
00:11:29.440 --> 00:11:32.960
- I am here.
 - They worked and learned to sail.

135
00:11:33.120 --> 00:11:37.720
- They jumped off and fled.
 - They are not criminals now, I think.

136
00:11:37.880 --> 00:11:42.480
-Do you think so?
 - I read something ...

137
00:11:42.640 --> 00:11:46.000
Elsa, should we drive?

138
00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:53.280
I drive Thanos.
 He looks tricky, but I think it can be good.

139
00:11:53.440 --> 00:11:55.320
–Thanos ... –yes.

140
00:12:00.400 --> 00:12:07.480
The Syrians, from the beginning when they emptied the day cash register before the cash register had taxed.

141
00:12:07.640 --> 00:12:10.800
Say it quickly five times.

142
00:12:10.960 --> 00:12:15.680
There are Syrians called Batch, which means stealing.

143
00:12:15.840 --> 00:12:21.320
- It's where it comes from.
 -Bullshit.

144
00:12:21.480 --> 00:12:26.680
- Why do you sound so doubtful?
 - I am bomb -proof.
 I don't believe you.

145
00:12:26.840 --> 00:12:30.840
You are doing absolutely right.
 Obviously it's false.

146
00:12:33.840 --> 00:12:38.800
- Whether you were BAXA coming from?
 - Unfortunately not, but please tell me.

147
00:12:38.960 --> 00:12:44.080
Baxa is an old honest Swedish word for moving things.

148
00:12:44.240 --> 00:12:49.800
- It was included in this year's college exam.
 - Concern have such random facts.

149
00:12:51.240 --> 00:12:55.480
Awesome work, Elsa.
 Congratulations.
 - Linda ...

150
00:12:59.560 --> 00:13:04.040
-Yes.
 - Unfortunately, you are poorly located now.

151
00:13:04.200 --> 00:13:10.040
But maybe catch a point?
 Honor in retaining, your children love you etc.

152
00:13:10.200 --> 00:13:14.520
–And grandchildren.
 -Grandchild?!

153
00:13:19.720 --> 00:13:23.880
- You want to drive?
 Who do you choose?
 - Daniel.

154
00:13:24.040 --> 00:13:29.760
- Will I last selected?
 - Just: "just like in the gym."

155
00:13:29.920 --> 00:13:34.600
- Daniel?
 You who are still from Rinkeby.
 - mm.

156
00:13:38.960 --> 00:13:41.520
Pork chop.

157
00:13:43.640 --> 00:13:50.000
No, the correct answer is lamb.
 Then I don't talk about Elaf's boyfriends.

158
00:13:50.920 --> 00:13:57.200
- I talk about real meat of lamb.
 -How?
 Does Daniel feel credible?

159
00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:01.240
Ramadan ...

160
00:14:01.400 --> 00:14:04.080
You knew the history of the Jews.

161
00:14:04.240 --> 00:14:08.880
It's the ninth month that Ramadan is.

162
00:14:09.040 --> 00:14:13.120
Do you know how many Muslims are just "Word" right now?

163
00:14:13.280 --> 00:14:17.360
- I wait for Saudi to say.
 - It's like lamb.

164
00:14:17.520 --> 00:14:21.760
It is certainly so.
 They party in lamb.

165
00:14:23.200 --> 00:14:25.520
No.

166
00:14:25.680 --> 00:14:30.680
Unfortunately, Linda.
 I wanted to give you one more.
 It's false.

167
00:14:30.840 --> 00:14:34.640
The correct answer is dates.

168
00:14:38.120 --> 00:14:40.160
Had you come up with it?

169
00:14:40.320 --> 00:14:45.120
It's dates.
 This is usually what Muslims break their fasting with.

170
00:14:45.280 --> 00:14:51.960
However, lamb is in the top five, with rice, rapeseed oil and chicken.
 Name!

171
00:14:52.120 --> 00:14:54.800
- Martin?
 - I don't have much to choose from.

172
00:14:54.960 --> 00:14:59.800
Sorry, I'm sorry.
 I am also a scan.
 If it makes it more fun.

173
00:14:59.960 --> 00:15:04.440
I understand what you are saying anyway.

174
00:15:10.720 --> 00:15:14.080
It is a really fun animal.

175
00:15:14.240 --> 00:15:16.240
Namely rabbit.

176
00:15:16.400 --> 00:15:22.480
They have no word for it in Persian, so they call it a ridge.

177
00:15:23.360 --> 00:15:25.160
Final.

178
00:15:26.840 --> 00:15:31.120
- Makes No Sense.
 - Have you met Iranians?

179
00:15:33.760 --> 00:15:36.040
No but...

180
00:15:37.400 --> 00:15:42.040
Just for that, I say she is right.
 That's right.

181
00:15:42.200 --> 00:15:47.280
Martin, it's incredible.
 Full fucking pot, then!

182
00:15:52.640 --> 00:15:56.440
A huge applause to Linda.

183
00:15:57.720 --> 00:16:03.680
An even bigger applause to Martin and Elsa who made it to the final!

184
00:16:05.880 --> 00:16:11.880
Now it's time for the final round.
 It is only to five points.

185
00:16:12.040 --> 00:16:17.400
Martin, you won the first round.
 You may start the final.

186
00:16:17.560 --> 00:16:21.680
- Who do you choose to talk to?
 - Mustafa.
 It went well last.

187
00:16:21.840 --> 00:16:24.120
- Mustafa?
 –Yes.

188
00:16:27.400 --> 00:16:30.240
Develop nuclear weapons.

189
00:16:32.640 --> 00:16:34.880
It is a form of courtesy.

190
00:16:35.040 --> 00:16:39.720
You offer something.
 So the person refuses no, but is offered again.

191
00:16:39.880 --> 00:16:45.280
Like food.
 "Eat, eat!"
 - "No, no, I'm measured."
 This is how you keep on.

192
00:16:45.440 --> 00:16:51.000
- I think it's true.
 -Just right.
 You can't miss.

193
00:16:57.960 --> 00:17:03.880
Taxi drivers usually refuse.
 You have to say: "Get paid."
 - Elsa!

194
00:17:04.040 --> 00:17:08.000
- I drive with Elaf, My Girl.
 - Yeah!
 I'm happy.

195
00:17:08.160 --> 00:17:11.480
- I trust you now.
 - Just truths here.

196
00:17:17.880 --> 00:17:19.960
Stolen goods.

197
00:17:21.960 --> 00:17:29.400
No, but actually a dirty fish.
 And that's their main thing at Christmas.

198
00:17:29.560 --> 00:17:33.440
It is so big so it can only fit in the bathtub.

199
00:17:33.600 --> 00:17:39.240
When someone is going to shower, put it in a bucket and then back in the bathtub.

200
00:17:39.400 --> 00:17:44.800
- I have to say that it is false.
 - You think it's false?

201
00:17:46.080 --> 00:17:49.440
You are wrong, Elsa.

202
00:17:49.600 --> 00:17:54.280
It sounded like a invention, but that's true.
 It is a Polish lutefish.

203
00:17:54.440 --> 00:17:57.840
It's called carp.
 A must on Polish Christmas.

204
00:17:58.000 --> 00:18:02.960
Because you answered wrong, Martin got one more point.

205
00:18:03.120 --> 00:18:05.400
Thanks so much.

206
00:18:08.640 --> 00:18:14.240
Elsa should have plugged in all the world's cultures, as Martin has done.

207
00:18:14.400 --> 00:18:18.480
Martin is from Skåne and has met everyone.

208
00:18:18.640 --> 00:18:21.920
- Eilsa comes from a small village.
 -Gothenburg!

209
00:18:22.080 --> 00:18:25.240
Martin?
 Who do you choose?

210
00:18:27.160 --> 00:18:32.040
- Farah, we drive again.
 Help me out.
 - Farah?

211
00:18:36.200 --> 00:18:39.840
Learned African dance at ABF.

212
00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:43.440
Throw the spear!
 It's popular.

213
00:18:43.600 --> 00:18:48.080
No.
 Sweden is not as innocent as one would like to believe.

214
00:18:48.240 --> 00:18:53.800
500 years ago, Swedes went to Africa -

215
00:18:53.960 --> 00:18:57.440
- took slaves, shipped over them to the Caribbean ...

216
00:18:57.600 --> 00:19:02.840
It was even
 A city called Gustavia, after the king.

217
00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:05.960
That's what they did.

218
00:19:06.120 --> 00:19:11.360
I know we had a colony called Sankt Bartolomeus or something.

219
00:19:11.520 --> 00:19:14.720
You are absolutely right.

220
00:19:14.880 --> 00:19:19.440
But did we transport slaves there?
 Were we so nasty?

221
00:19:19.600 --> 00:19:23.240
- Did we make it?!
 - It's false.

222
00:19:23.400 --> 00:19:26.000
Tell him, Ahmed!

223
00:19:26.160 --> 00:19:31.680
Incredible that you are like this: "We had a colony."
 A resort, then?

224
00:19:31.840 --> 00:19:35.520
- They wanted to work for free.
 - Hotel, beach ...

225
00:19:35.680 --> 00:19:39.520
You thought, "It was like Marbella, huh?"

226
00:19:39.680 --> 00:19:45.200
Martin, unfortunately.
 You lost.
 That was absolutely true, what Farah said.

227
00:19:45.360 --> 00:19:48.600
Not applause for slavery!

228
00:19:51.800 --> 00:19:58.080
Not only did you lose your first point.
 Elsa got a point.

229
00:20:01.200 --> 00:20:05.800
The Swedish I heard: "We had a colony. No slaves."

230
00:20:06.560 --> 00:20:09.680
Elsa?
 Who do you want to talk to?

231
00:20:09.840 --> 00:20:13.280
- I drive with Evelyn again.
 –Evelyn.

232
00:20:17.600 --> 00:20:23.640
Okay.
 There were two names.
 It was Glenn and Abdi.

233
00:20:23.800 --> 00:20:27.240
But: Glenn, hyphen, Abdi.

234
00:20:27.400 --> 00:20:32.240
For in Gothenburg there are many Somali families.

235
00:20:32.400 --> 00:20:37.360
Abdi is a common Somali name.
 They want to integrate their children.

236
00:20:37.520 --> 00:20:41.560
They have chosen Gothenburg's most common name, Glenn.

237
00:20:41.720 --> 00:20:46.240
Glenn, hyphen, Abdi.
 Although Glenn everyday is Silent.

238
00:20:46.400 --> 00:20:49.560
/LAUGH/

239
00:20:55.960 --> 00:21:01.160
Mustafa, it seems that Somalis in Gothenburg have read your book.

240
00:21:07.360 --> 00:21:11.840
Do you think what Evelyn said is true or false?

241
00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:18.600
Is the most common boy name in Gothenburg 2019 Glenn-ABDI?

242
00:21:18.760 --> 00:21:22.880
I have to respond falsely to it.

243
00:21:23.040 --> 00:21:27.720
Obviously it's false.
 You've received a point.
 Congratulations!

244
00:21:29.920 --> 00:21:36.120
The most common boy name in Gothenburg 2019 was Elias -

245
00:21:36.280 --> 00:21:40.560
- But in second place came Muhammad, so we're soon there.

246
00:21:40.720 --> 00:21:44.240
- Martin?
 - I choose Victor.

247
00:21:44.400 --> 00:21:47.440
-Good choice.
 - Victor?

248
00:21:50.640 --> 00:21:57.320
South Korea.
 South Korea manufactures very well and advanced things.

249
00:21:57.480 --> 00:22:03.280
Smart children, such as
 K-pop artists.
 So it's South Korea.

250
00:22:05.000 --> 00:22:08.200
I have a feeling that it is true.

251
00:22:08.360 --> 00:22:11.520
-You are a big BTS fan?
 -Yes.

252
00:22:12.640 --> 00:22:16.840
--What is?
 - He just: "What is it?"

253
00:22:17.000 --> 00:22:20.640
- You think what Victor says is true.
 -Yes.

254
00:22:20.800 --> 00:22:26.480
You shouldn't.
 It's fake!
 The point goes to Elsa.

255
00:22:30.520 --> 00:22:36.600
The country Swedes adopt most from is Sweden.

256
00:22:36.760 --> 00:22:42.040
Domestic adoption is more common than foreign since 2013.

257
00:22:42.200 --> 00:22:45.600
It's like weed, it's Home Grown.

258
00:22:45.760 --> 00:22:49.160
Elsa?
 Who do you choose?

259
00:22:50.640 --> 00:22:55.120
- I drive afrobellas.
 - Bring it on.

260
00:23:02.120 --> 00:23:06.720
In Sweden, most of the crispbread have at home, if you are Swedish.

261
00:23:06.880 --> 00:23:12.360
If you are from Somalia, it is strange if you do not have the track at home.

262
00:23:12.520 --> 00:23:18.880
They usually cut it up or mash it.
 /Smashes/

263
00:23:21.880 --> 00:23:24.600
I'm saying fake.

264
00:23:24.760 --> 00:23:28.560
I heard a Somalis in the audience: "huh?"

265
00:23:30.040 --> 00:23:35.920
Unfortunately, Elsa.
 That is absolutely true.
 Martin then got a point.

266
00:23:38.000 --> 00:23:42.680
- We do not mash.
 It's just there.
 -But why?

267
00:23:42.840 --> 00:23:46.560
-Why?
 - It's a culinary experience.

268
00:23:46.720 --> 00:23:51.480
- The track with rice?
 - It's sweet, salty, strong ...

269
00:23:53.720 --> 00:23:57.520
SOOMALIYEEY TOOSOO

270
00:23:59.960 --> 00:24:04.920
- Martin?
 –Yes.
 I choose Thanos.

271
00:24:14.000 --> 00:24:17.600
It's actually from Kulu.

272
00:24:17.760 --> 00:24:22.520
I put on the Turk.
 Kulu in Turkey, it had become a city.

273
00:24:22.680 --> 00:24:30.640
9 out of 10 Turks in Sweden come from Kulu.
 They have such a place in Kulu.

274
00:24:30.800 --> 00:24:33.560
/Someone laughs out loud/

275
00:24:33.720 --> 00:24:40.560
- Is you going to another person now?
 -Take it easy.
 I market myself.

276
00:24:40.720 --> 00:24:45.400
- Don't you Greek?
 - A few, it's the same.

277
00:24:48.040 --> 00:24:50.760
What do you think, Martin?

278
00:24:52.080 --> 00:24:54.760
I think that's true.

279
00:24:54.920 --> 00:25:00.320
In the Turkish city of Kulu there is a parade street named after Olof Palme.

280
00:25:01.720 --> 00:25:05.440
Martin, that's fucking right.
 Congratulations!

281
00:25:07.600 --> 00:25:12.800
You know, when I become Turk, I speak the truth.

282
00:25:12.960 --> 00:25:17.720
First it was called Kulufornia.

283
00:25:17.880 --> 00:25:24.840
Then Hollywood, they have taken California, contract 100 years, just hot kulu.

284
00:25:25.000 --> 00:25:29.160
Elsa, that's your turn.
 But it is worth reminding you om-

285
00:25:29.320 --> 00:25:33.480
- That if you answer wrong now, and Martin gets the point -

286
00:25:33.640 --> 00:25:36.640
- Martin has won the whole thing.

287
00:25:36.800 --> 00:25:42.120
-No stress!
 - nice.
 I have to pick points now.

288
00:25:42.280 --> 00:25:46.120
- Then of course I choose Assia.
 -Okay.

289
00:25:46.280 --> 00:25:49.280
- Come again Gbg.
 --Assia?

290
00:25:56.720 --> 00:26:02.640
He wanted to introduce his Sunday Service Choir-

291
00:26:02.800 --> 00:26:07.040
- With the English School and the Word of Life.

292
00:26:07.200 --> 00:26:11.360
- False.
 - False?

293
00:26:11.520 --> 00:26:15.760
Congratulations, Elsa.
 You got a point.

294
00:26:19.040 --> 00:26:22.880
Do you know which organizations West tried to collaborate with?

295
00:26:23.040 --> 00:26:29.360
–Ikea.
 Then I can't the other.
 -Think of...

296
00:26:29.520 --> 00:26:33.800
-Beard.
 Or?
 -What fuck is that, the man?

297
00:26:33.960 --> 00:26:37.520
-I get it!
 AC ... –Acne!

298
00:26:37.680 --> 00:26:43.040
- The man, what is it?
 - It's panic.

299
00:26:43.200 --> 00:26:49.920
Right now to our producer: "Next program: Charades with black shells."

300
00:26:50.080 --> 00:26:54.720
- Type like this.
 - For the first thing, it's bulges.

301
00:26:54.880 --> 00:26:59.720
- I pop a pimple.
 - How big are your pimples?

302
00:26:59.880 --> 00:27:05.360
-What is it?!
 - Because it's a lot.

303
00:27:05.520 --> 00:27:09.600
I'll let you continue the debate later.

304
00:27:09.760 --> 00:27:14.800
We are in an exciting situation.
 - It's your turn, Martin.

305
00:27:14.960 --> 00:27:21.600
If you guess right, you have won.
 If you guess wrong, Elsa has won.

306
00:27:21.760 --> 00:27:23.840
OOOH!

307
00:27:24.000 --> 00:27:27.840
It's always on the white man.

308
00:27:28.000 --> 00:27:33.000
- Team Elsa.
 - What do you choose?

309
00:27:33.160 --> 00:27:36.320
- Filip.
 - Shit!

310
00:27:42.880 --> 00:27:49.480
Dachri is a combination word of respect and humility.

311
00:27:49.640 --> 00:27:54.880
It is important to show at Stora Dachri.

312
00:27:55.040 --> 00:28:00.920
It is often communicated in interaction between younger and older generations.

313
00:28:01.080 --> 00:28:07.240
You show Great Dachri by putting your hand on the heart and saying: "Dachri."

314
00:28:08.880 --> 00:28:11.080
–Yes.
 - Martin?

315
00:28:11.240 --> 00:28:17.160
- I think it's bullshit.
 - You have no big Dachri.

316
00:28:17.320 --> 00:28:22.200
I know when you say in Arab Ala Rasi and so you do this.

317
00:28:22.360 --> 00:28:27.720
What the hell does Dachri have to do?
 There are two different languages!

318
00:28:27.880 --> 00:28:33.000
Let him talk about Arabic.
 Tell us about Arabic.

319
00:28:33.160 --> 00:28:39.520
He made a type: "Are you Syrian? I know an Arab!"
 Completely crazy.

320
00:28:43.520 --> 00:28:47.200
"Do you know my friend, Mahmud?"

321
00:28:48.920 --> 00:28:53.760
- What had your Arab friend taught you?
 -Ala Rasi.
 It's respect.

322
00:28:53.920 --> 00:28:58.160
--Ala Rasi is my head.
 - No, on my head.

323
00:28:58.320 --> 00:29:02.920
- I know very Arabic.
 - He thought it was respect.

324
00:29:05.200 --> 00:29:08.400
- You have never heard of Dachri?
 -No never.

325
00:29:08.560 --> 00:29:13.320
I will tell you.
