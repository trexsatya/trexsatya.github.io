1
00:00:11,420 --> 00:00:14,780
Damn, what a moped !!

2
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:35,780
-Hello!
 Hey.

3
00:00:35,780 --> 00:00:37,400
-How's it going?
 It is just fine.

4
00:00:37,400 --> 00:00:40,295
My name is Mats Ohlsson.
 Hi Mats my name is Douglas

5
00:00:40,300 --> 00:00:43,860
-I have understood that you like mopeds?
 Yes, that's my passion.

6
00:00:43,860 --> 00:00:46,700
-What is this?
 Well I have a son.

7
00:00:46,700 --> 00:00:51,460
He is often in the garage and helps.
 Have river and pick up apart and think it's fun.

8
00:00:51,460 --> 00:00:54,380
-It's fun with mopeds and there were many here.

9
00:00:54,380 --> 00:00:57,480
Yes it is well ... half of the ones I own anyway.

10
00:00:57,480 --> 00:00:59,200
-What do you want to show first?

11
00:00:59,200 --> 00:01:02,400
Yes, that is what I like most and it is Zundapp.

12
00:01:02,400 --> 00:01:04,560
Zundapp and drag racing are my passion.

13
00:01:04,560 --> 00:01:06,620
-Do you drive drag racing with mopeds?

14
00:01:06,620 --> 00:01:11,700
There are competitions around the country and even the SM is included.

15
00:01:11,700 --> 00:01:13,940
-How is it that you started with drag racing?

16
00:01:13,940 --> 00:01:20,120
I have screwed a lot with drag racing when I was younger, kind of promod.

17
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:24,980
Also screwed up a bit with snowmobile drag racing.

18
00:01:24,980 --> 00:01:27,640
I've always liked drag racing.

19
00:01:27,640 --> 00:01:30,860
-What is you competing with?
 Should we check what you have.

20
00:01:30,860 --> 00:01:34,520
We can start with the veteran class.
 Then you can have one here.

21
00:01:34,520 --> 00:01:39,860
Sure you can have a finer but I have chosen it to look a little worn.

22
00:01:39,860 --> 00:01:42,380
-Lite Rat Rod?
 Yes.

23
00:01:42,380 --> 00:01:46,660
Mechanically, it is in top condition.
 All brakes and layers are replaced.

24
00:01:46,660 --> 00:01:49,300
It is very nice condition even though it is not visible.

25
00:01:49,300 --> 00:01:53,260
-70 numbers?
 No all mopeds I have are 66or.

26
00:01:53,260 --> 00:01:55,240
Sport Combinette 1966.

27
00:01:55,240 --> 00:01:58,375
So it is -66 that applies?
 Yes right now ...

28
00:01:58,380 --> 00:02:00,640
I have a little newer too.

29
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:05,040
The mopeds that stand here are from 1966.

30
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:09,980
This is a 1966 Zundapp Sport Combinette Veteranmoped in Veteran 70.

31
00:02:09,980 --> 00:02:13,500
There is a veteran 50, 70 and 90.

32
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:15,980
-Is the number of cubic?

33
00:02:15,980 --> 00:02:21,720
Then you can trim to 52cc, 72cc or 92cc and that is the maximum limit.

34
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:27,220
This one is at 66cc with a super term Athena cylinder.

35
00:02:27,220 --> 00:02:30,900
It is not stroked so I am a little far in cylinder volume.

36
00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:33,220
It is possible to stroke up to 72cc.

37
00:02:33,220 --> 00:02:35,920
-What does it cost to trim?
 Is it expensive?

38
00:02:37,580 --> 00:02:41,360
Both yes and no.
 It is a cheap sport to be motorsport.

39
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:45,000
Motorsport costs money but this is cheap.

40
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:48,900
I crashed a motor a week ago.

41
00:02:48,900 --> 00:02:51,600
The block burst and the gearbox ...

42
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:55,360
It cost SEK 2500 to cook.
 -Oh!

43
00:02:55,360 --> 00:03:00,200
A little drive and shoulders then you can drive again.

44
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:03,280
A car engine that breaks can cost SEK 75,000 to cook.

45
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:05,000
Absolutely!
 Or more.

46
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:09,000
This one I bought far out in the woods a few miles from here.

47
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:13,160
The only thing I couldn't fix was the idea.

48
00:03:13,160 --> 00:03:16,100
It was so rusty so now there is a tank in the tank.

49
00:03:16,100 --> 00:03:17,800
-A tank in the thought?

50
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:21,060
Well!
 -It could not be repair.

51
00:03:21,060 --> 00:03:23,780
There is a smaller tank inside.

52
00:03:23,780 --> 00:03:26,840
Aha!
 It is just to keep the look.

53
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:30,200
-What is this?
 It is flocked.

54
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:36,680
It was very popular in the 70s to spray on.

55
00:03:36,680 --> 00:03:40,280
It is very popular today.
 Yes it may have come back.

56
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:44,920
Flowed dashboards, yes and stereo stuff etc.

57
00:03:44,920 --> 00:03:49,800
-The glue did not look so nice.
 No, but it should look like this.

58
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:52,180
It must not look too "good".

59
00:03:52,180 --> 00:03:57,500
-What is that?
 I first drove with original loaf

60
00:03:57,500 --> 00:04:00,100
When I shipped the moped to Lycksele for a competition ...

61
00:04:00,100 --> 00:04:04,280
... but then it started to rain so then I had to pull on a bag.

62
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:07,220
So I wouldn't get wet when I competed.

63
00:04:07,220 --> 00:04:09,960
The moped is slowed down.

64
00:04:09,960 --> 00:04:12,940
15.7 hp on the back Christmas.
 -15 hp!?

65
00:04:12,940 --> 00:04:15,535
Yes 15.7 and earlier it had 15.4 hp.

66
00:04:15,540 --> 00:04:21,680
I think it has a little more now because it is going better.

67
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:24,220
It goes well and turns ...

68
00:04:24,220 --> 00:04:30,800
The last time I drove I had driven a little too low then I had 14,500 laps above the finish line after 200 meters.

69
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:32,700
Then I had to drive up.

70
00:04:32,700 --> 00:04:38,280
-What speeds do you come up with?
 I have driven 102-103 km/h at its best.

71
00:04:38,280 --> 00:04:40,000
-You're joking!?

72
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,240
-On a moped ??

73
00:04:42,640 --> 00:04:45,920
10.3 seconds.

74
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:52,260
-Do you run 200 meters?
 Yes, 200 meters with a stationary start.

75
00:04:52,260 --> 00:04:54,660
-How many gears do you have?
 This one has four.

76
00:04:54,660 --> 00:04:58,060
3-4 years ago, 3 drove.

77
00:04:58,060 --> 00:05:01,620
It was such a big step between 2an and 3an.

78
00:05:01,620 --> 00:05:03,920
It is not suitable for drag racing.

79
00:05:03,920 --> 00:05:06,320
Not if you are going to perform good times.

80
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:10,380
What I remembered from when I was young.
 Now I didn't have Zundapp myself ...

81
00:05:10,380 --> 00:05:16,260
... was that the gear slider had a long stroke.

82
00:05:16,260 --> 00:05:19,200
Yes you hit the knee in the elbow.

83
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:23,020
That is why we who compete have gear stops.

84
00:05:23,020 --> 00:05:24,560
-The gear stop?

85
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:27,940
I never miss a gear with this.

86
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:31,140
It is rare and works great.

87
00:05:31,140 --> 00:05:36,600
It takes time to adjust because you rarely get a gear when driving slowly.

88
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:41,500
If you drive fast, it will be easier.

89
00:05:41,500 --> 00:05:44,020
-Then we take the next moped.
 Which one would you like to show then?

90
00:05:44,020 --> 00:05:46,100
We can take this one.

91
00:05:46,100 --> 00:05:49,220
This is a new building for this year.

92
00:05:49,220 --> 00:05:53,200
It is also a veteran 70cc the same class as the other.

93
00:05:53,240 --> 00:05:58,500
In the veteran 70cc you can also run a liquid cold.
 -Wide cold?

94
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:02,700
This one has Stage 6 cylinder from Minarelli.

95
00:06:02,700 --> 00:06:05,140
It is also stroked.

96
00:06:05,140 --> 00:06:09,080
If I were to drive with Zundapp's stroke, I get more than 72cc.

97
00:06:09,080 --> 00:06:13,760
It is stroked to 39.7 and reed -fed.

98
00:06:13,760 --> 00:06:18,200
It was this engine that I was broken earlier this spring but now it is up again.

99
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:21,015
-The here you also have gear stops on.
 Yes I have that on everyone.

100
00:06:21,020 --> 00:06:25,840
This one I can error for a gear but next year I hope I have adjusted it.

101
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:29,080
-When you compete do you have several mopeds with you?

102
00:06:29,080 --> 00:06:32,480
Last time I had 3 mopeds with me but it is too much.

103
00:06:32,500 --> 00:06:34,740
There will be more quantity than quality.

104
00:06:34,740 --> 00:06:38,620
I can't give all the mopeds love between the runs.

105
00:06:38,620 --> 00:06:42,540
One or two is recommended.
 -How very screw is it vs run?

106
00:06:42,540 --> 00:06:45,060
Hmm ... change drives and nozzles ..

107
00:06:45,060 --> 00:06:49,920
..The rusty I have been running so many years so I almost do not screw it.

108
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:53,160
Just pushed up a cog last time and it was probably the only thing.

109
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:58,380
This requires ignition adjustment, mouth cut ... ... there are so many adjustments left.

110
00:06:58,380 --> 00:07:05,020
It can take 10 hours of driving before it goes 90% of its capacity.

111
00:07:05,020 --> 00:07:10,400
The rusty is probably 100% of its capacity.
 It is almost not possible to drive anything faster with it.

112
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:13,405
It is difficult.
 But this is much left.

113
00:07:13,405 --> 00:07:16,540
This one should go faster than the rusty but it does not.

114
00:07:16,540 --> 00:07:18,520
It's a long way to go yet.

115
00:07:18,520 --> 00:07:23,100
-It's still a run -in period?
 Yes much left to adjust.

116
00:07:23,220 --> 00:07:27,480
-The idea looks a little different?
 Yes it is older.

117
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:29,540
I think this idea is good looking.

118
00:07:29,540 --> 00:07:33,560
-The elder What is the year model then?
 1964 or 1965.

119
00:07:33,560 --> 00:07:38,700
The pear tank is much nicer than the rusty one.
 -Yes both are fine.

120
00:07:38,700 --> 00:07:41,240
I see another thing.
 If you straighten the handlebars.

121
00:07:41,240 --> 00:07:45,600
-It wasn't that wide rule?
 It's just a bicycle government.

122
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:48,180
There were many buttons to be a moped.
 Yes...

123
00:07:49,900 --> 00:07:52,300
Here is the water pump.

124
00:07:52,320 --> 00:07:54,520
The temp meter.

125
00:07:54,860 --> 00:07:57,360
And the electric fan.

126
00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:04,000
-Is there a speedometer with?
 No.

127
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,400
Only temperature meter.

128
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:10,100
And dead man's grip.
 There must be when we run drag racing.

129
00:08:10,100 --> 00:08:19,160
I drive with HPI ignition system so I can choose between 2 ignition curves quickly.

130
00:08:19,160 --> 00:08:23,980
What job!
 The tires appear to be the same as my mc.

131
00:08:23,980 --> 00:08:27,060
Continental Type MC Tire

132
00:08:27,060 --> 00:08:30,800
Need there to be some special brakes?
 No, but it must work.

133
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:36,040
Often you have a long distance to slow down when competing.

134
00:08:36,040 --> 00:08:39,300
Some paths may be a short distance.

135
00:08:39,980 --> 00:08:43,600
Often it is enough to release the gas.

136
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:47,340
But it is important that they work if something happens.

137
00:08:47,340 --> 00:08:50,320
We also have a third moped but it looks a little different.

138
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:53,660
This is the next class, Promod.

139
00:08:53,660 --> 00:08:57,000
-Promod!?
 Yes it sounds violent.

140
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:00,860
Promod is available in 50, 70 and 100cc.

141
00:09:00,860 --> 00:09:05,180
Promod 100 is a cruel class and they drive really fast.

142
00:09:05,180 --> 00:09:11,040
In Promod you can have modern engines.
 For example, AM6 and derby engines.

143
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:16,900
And in this class there are vespor with variant operation and they are going really well.

144
00:09:16,900 --> 00:09:21,700
When everything is adjusted, it's just full gas.

145
00:09:21,780 --> 00:09:25,840
I have chosen to run a Zundapp engine on this with.

146
00:09:25,840 --> 00:09:30,580
-What does a modern engine mean?
 Yes you can have 6-gears.

147
00:09:30,580 --> 00:09:34,080
Most of them are reed -fed original.

148
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:39,260
It is awesome and lightly trimmed engines.

149
00:09:39,780 --> 00:09:42,740
This is a little more complicated.
 -You hold you to Zundapp.

150
00:09:42,740 --> 00:09:47,200
It would be to put on an AM6 engine on this.

151
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:49,360
Then I would rather get further down in the field.

152
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:52,880
This is a promod 50, ie 50cc.

153
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:56,760
The rusty is 66cc in the veteran 70 class.

154
00:09:56,760 --> 00:10:02,540
This one is quite exactly 70cc in the same class.

155
00:10:02,540 --> 00:10:06,100
And this Promod 50 and it is about 50cc.

156
00:10:06,100 --> 00:10:10,440
It is also stroked to 39.7 to keep the cubic limit.

157
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:14,760
-This this has Wheelie Bars.
 Yes but I have not used that ..

158
00:10:14,760 --> 00:10:18,260
... since it has not adjusted yet, I do not have the need yet.

159
00:10:18,260 --> 00:10:21,340
But when everything works, I need it.

160
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:26,060
The other mopeds can turn around because it is too short wheelbase.

161
00:10:26,380 --> 00:10:28,560
May be very careful at the start.

162
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:33,420
60 foot I run in 2.2 seconds at its best.

163
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:39,100
When this is optimized it is for 2 seconds and then Wheelie Bar is needed otherwise it will not be possible.

164
00:10:39,100 --> 00:10:41,600
I understand!
 This moped is much longer.

165
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:46,500
It is a self-built frame that is extended 12-13 cm.

166
00:10:46,500 --> 00:10:52,420
And the parts extended about 5 cm.
 So it is about 20 cm longer than a standard moped.

167
00:10:52,420 --> 00:10:58,760
I've seen 3 different things.
 The rusty has the board forward.

168
00:10:58,760 --> 00:11:02,700
Yes it is to get as far ahead as possible at the start.

169
00:11:02,940 --> 00:11:07,160
-And you have turned the handlebar forward.
 Yes it is true.

170
00:11:07,420 --> 00:11:12,280
Here the handlebar sits in the right place but is straight.

171
00:11:12,280 --> 00:11:18,620
It is straight and a little more weight back but it works.

172
00:11:18,620 --> 00:11:23,320
And this moped has the board far down.
 Yes has moved down the handlebars on the front fork.

173
00:11:23,320 --> 00:11:25,960
To be able to hang as far ahead as possible.

174
00:11:25,960 --> 00:11:33,080
The entire moped is cast in fiberglass.
 We have done plugs from a moped.

175
00:11:33,080 --> 00:11:36,820
The idea with?
 The tank is in fiberglass.

176
00:11:36,820 --> 00:11:42,160
Below is a small trump card here.
 There are several who have it in Promod.

177
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:44,300
It is nitrous oxide fed.
 -Näää.

178
00:11:44,300 --> 00:11:46,060
-Hahaha!

179
00:11:46,060 --> 00:11:47,720
So it looks here.

180
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:49,780
-What moped!

181
00:11:49,780 --> 00:11:55,320
How long have you been building this?
 I've probably stayed for 1.5 years.

182
00:11:55,320 --> 00:11:59,640
Me and a friend named Magnus Lindelöv have helped me very much.

183
00:11:59,640 --> 00:12:01,560
It is we who have built this one.

184
00:12:01,560 --> 00:12:08,660
He lives nearby so we have garage evenings with a folk beer and fixes with the mopeds.

185
00:12:08,660 --> 00:12:10,680
Cozy and it sounds great fun.

186
00:12:10,680 --> 00:12:14,900
-How many competitions is that?
 There are 4 SM competitions.

187
00:12:14,900 --> 00:12:19,540
Geographically it has been Lycksele ..

188
00:12:19,540 --> 00:12:21,520
Hudiksvall ....

189
00:12:21,520 --> 00:12:25,380
Orsa and Ludvika and it has been different every year.

190
00:12:25,380 --> 00:12:28,020
And this year it was a competition in Laxå.

191
00:12:28,640 --> 00:12:30,400
That was driven.

192
00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:32,540
-How many are you competing?

193
00:12:32,540 --> 00:12:36,700
-We were quite a few last and then we were 33 in total.

194
00:12:36,700 --> 00:12:42,600
It is not a huge hobby, but we hope it will come and drive.

195
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:46,380
-Can imagine it's fun to watch.
 It's really fun.

196
00:12:46,380 --> 00:12:49,700
-We have been to any competition with cars ...

197
00:12:49,740 --> 00:12:53,495
... they are impressed and think it is powerful.

198
00:12:53,500 --> 00:12:57,980
We are not dissected, they think it is cool so I hope more will start competing.

199
00:12:57,980 --> 00:13:03,020
-What is the most fun to drive?
 Right now it's the rusty one because it delivers.

200
00:13:03,020 --> 00:13:06,025
After all, it is tested to the max.

201
00:13:06,025 --> 00:13:08,655
The other two I have a lot of work left.

202
00:13:08,700 --> 00:13:10,840
-Both?
 Yes both.

203
00:13:10,840 --> 00:13:15,520
I tested it chassis last year and had this engine on.

204
00:13:15,520 --> 00:13:20,480
Just to test the chassis and then I used this engine a polini that I ported myself.

205
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:25,300
I drove 10.3 and 105-106 km/h with that engine.

206
00:13:25,300 --> 00:13:29,560
In this chassis and then I discovered that it had to be strengthened.

207
00:13:29,560 --> 00:13:32,100
Trying to build as easily as possible but ...

208
00:13:32,100 --> 00:13:36,400
... that engine twisted the entire chassis.

209
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:41,180
The chassis was too clumsy so I had to reinforce.

210
00:13:41,180 --> 00:13:43,980
Last year you can say that chassis work well.

211
00:13:43,980 --> 00:13:47,780
This year I have used the real engine but ...

212
00:13:47,780 --> 00:13:49,815
... I have had problems with.

213
00:13:49,820 --> 00:13:56,440
It sounds strange and I have scrapped some membrane and blown packing boxes when I drive nitrous oxide.

214
00:13:57,640 --> 00:13:59,160
This is how there is ...

215
00:13:59,160 --> 00:14:02,160
-How many people drive with nitrous oxide on mopeds?

216
00:14:02,500 --> 00:14:04,800
Yes there are some pieces ...

217
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:08,380
... there are also those who drive with nitro in promod.

218
00:14:08,380 --> 00:14:12,640
And those who drive with methanol.

219
00:14:12,640 --> 00:14:15,000
It is quite unlimited in Promod.

220
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:18,280
-How is the buddy at the competitions?
 It is very good.

221
00:14:18,280 --> 00:14:22,280
-Ing hard rivalry?
 No, it's a nice level.

222
00:14:22,280 --> 00:14:27,400
There is no prestige.
 Everyone knows everyone and we have fun in the evenings.

223
00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:32,120
-You don't reveal your secrets?

224
00:14:32,120 --> 00:14:37,980
A little bit so maybe, gate times etc ..

225
00:14:37,980 --> 00:14:41,760
-When you trim do everything yourself?
 I try to do everything myself.

226
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:46,840
I have built some pipes but have not got it really well.

227
00:14:46,840 --> 00:14:50,620
Recently, I have bought ready -made that I have modified.

228
00:14:50,640 --> 00:14:55,380
Contracted header, shortened and extended and made adjustments.

229
00:14:55,480 --> 00:15:03,100
So that it hangs like a snake in the ceiling.
 Yes a little different pipes that I have tried over the years.

230
00:15:03,100 --> 00:15:05,720
-How long holds a piston & cylinder?

231
00:15:05,720 --> 00:15:09,560
That .. you talk about the rusty, huh?

232
00:15:09,560 --> 00:15:15,640
I have been running it for 2 years and I changed piston ring this spring that's all.

233
00:15:15,940 --> 00:15:20,520
Although it turns so much so it holds well.

234
00:15:20,700 --> 00:15:23,000
-What is this?
 It looks like...

235
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,100
Here I usually sit and port cylinders.

236
00:15:25,100 --> 00:15:28,420
Isn't this a goldsmith usually use?

237
00:15:28,420 --> 00:15:30,500
Well, it's from an old workshop.

238
00:15:30,500 --> 00:15:34,680
It is a little small sometimes and I have not been able to port coil.

239
00:15:34,680 --> 00:15:41,320
Now I have found this and I think it is from the 60s.
 It is old dental equipment.

240
00:15:42,200 --> 00:15:47,280
Now I come down in the cylinders so I can change the coil.

241
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:51,960
-Where can you find such old stuff?
 Think it was at Tradera.

242
00:15:51,960 --> 00:15:55,100
You had one more moped over here is it also a Zundapp?

243
00:15:55,100 --> 00:15:59,580
Yes it is a ride moped completely original.
 Okay a utility lashes.

244
00:15:59,580 --> 00:16:03,220
-Year model?
 1969 with the famous ...

245
00:16:03,220 --> 00:16:04,940
... purse crushes the idea.

246
00:16:04,940 --> 00:16:07,600
-HAHAHA!!!
 Yes you see why.

247
00:16:07,900 --> 00:16:10,380
Don't want to drive into something.

248
00:16:11,260 --> 00:16:15,040
The "famous" purse crushes the idea, fantastic!

249
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:20,560
I was at a moped rally last year but I wouldn't be allowed to come again if I didn't trim.

250
00:16:20,580 --> 00:16:23,080
So that engine will be on this fall.

251
00:16:23,100 --> 00:16:26,300
-It must not be original?
 No no...

252
00:16:26,300 --> 00:16:28,460
... it's for old people.

253
00:16:29,240 --> 00:16:36,280
-How has it been when you compete?
 Yes you have stayed in them over the parts of the classes.

254
00:16:36,280 --> 00:16:38,980
Become 1a, 2a & 3a.

255
00:16:38,980 --> 00:16:45,460
Sometimes you go out in the first round that I did last weekend against a quick moped.

256
00:16:45,860 --> 00:16:49,580
Then you are out of the steps.

257
00:16:49,900 --> 00:16:54,960
It was against a teammate Jens Hägglund.

258
00:16:54,960 --> 00:16:56,660
That bastard!
 -Hahaha!

259
00:16:57,300 --> 00:17:00,940
I have no problem with that.
 He was faster than me.

260
00:17:00,940 --> 00:17:06,320
It is worse if you miss the start or a gear and lose when you have a faster moped.

261
00:17:06,320 --> 00:17:12,320
Then it does not feel good but if you lose to a faster moped it is easier to take.

262
00:17:12,320 --> 00:17:13,920
-Is there any moped we can start?

263
00:17:13,920 --> 00:17:18,100
Can start any.
 We can start up the rusty.

264
00:17:18,100 --> 00:17:23,400
Don't think people understand that there is a lot to drive when it looks like it does.

265
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:27,080
Absolutely, pick it up.

266
00:17:27,080 --> 00:17:31,040
-Do you nice on that one?
 No!

267
00:17:31,040 --> 00:17:35,640
I usually train a lot of starts and get abrasions the inside of the thighs.

268
00:17:35,640 --> 00:17:38,620
So it is not nice but all for the look.

269
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:34,740
14400 rpm.
 Well I have alternated more sometimes.

270
00:18:34,740 --> 00:18:39,060
Now it's cold so I don't want to torment it.

271
00:19:05,500 --> 00:19:07,480
Damn!

272
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:08,780
Which moped.

273
00:19:24,135 --> 00:19:27,205
15840 RPM, Jeeesus!

274
00:19:27,205 --> 00:19:31,280
Is there any club in town?
 Yes there is a club called RFR.

275
00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:34,920
RFR?
 Straight forward racing so simple it is.

276
00:19:34,920 --> 00:19:40,600
There are some in Ö-vik, Lycksele and Bjäst.

277
00:19:40,600 --> 00:19:43,120
Great name!
 Easy.

278
00:19:53,880 --> 00:19:57,120
Hahaha!
 It sounds like a cross.

279
00:20:22,980 --> 00:20:27,780
16320 rpm, it's totally crazy.

280
00:20:27,780 --> 00:20:29,720
-This is like a cross.

281
00:20:29,720 --> 00:20:32,920
Yes the light is deceiving.

282
00:20:32,940 --> 00:20:34,940
Hahaha, really!

283
00:20:34,940 --> 00:20:38,620
It's totally crazy.
 I didn't get the camera when you drove past.

284
00:20:38,620 --> 00:20:45,060
A little missed gears when it is not a sharp position and you have foppa slippers.

285
00:20:45,060 --> 00:20:47,200
Normally, the gears sit as they should.

286
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:51,000
Not many people do not think it should go fast when you see it.
 It usually is so.

287
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:56,400
It has a lovely sound.
 Yes it is straight in the clutch basket.

288
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:58,720
So it wines a little neighbor.

289
00:20:58,720 --> 00:21:00,360
What a machine!

290
00:21:00,360 --> 00:21:03,020
-How should you go if you want to start competing?

291
00:21:03,300 --> 00:21:07,800
There are 2 pages on the Internet and Facebook.

292
00:21:07,800 --> 00:21:12,180
Facebook: Swedish Moped Dragracing and Lyckseletwostroke.se

293
00:21:12,420 --> 00:21:17,580
There you can read and ask questions.

294
00:21:17,620 --> 00:21:19,500
Check out past events.

295
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:25,600
Then I think you should start competing.
 There are so many sharp mopeds ...

296
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:30,780
... which can be competed with.
 It's really fun.

297
00:21:30,780 --> 00:21:34,400
1000 thanks for taking the time to show the moped.

298
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:40,120
It is really appreciated and it has given me a new view of trimmed mopeds.

299
00:21:40,120 --> 00:21:43,940
See you later!
 I hope to see this on a hit.

300
00:21:43,940 --> 00:21:48,960
Yes, I get to go on a meeting in between Sweden and drive a little.

301
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:52,300
1000 thanks!
 We hear hello!
