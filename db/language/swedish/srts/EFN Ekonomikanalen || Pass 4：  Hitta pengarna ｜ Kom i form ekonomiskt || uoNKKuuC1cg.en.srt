1
00:00:00,040 --> 00:00:03,400
-Today we will talk about income.
 -Yes.

2
00:00:03,480 --> 00:00:06,480
-You really like income.
 -You too.

3
00:00:06,560 --> 00:00:09,040
-You are crazy in income.
 -No, you are.

4
00:00:14,920 --> 00:00:17,840
I have to keep track of my finances now.

5
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:23,240
Mia IngelstrÃ¶m is not only an economist, she is also a personal trainer in economics.

6
00:00:23,320 --> 00:00:27,200
Yes, you hear.
 Should we start this?

7
00:00:29,960 --> 00:00:34,240
Hello.
 Here Mia and me and "Chitchattar" are about economics.

8
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:36,800
-Nice.
 -Yes is not it?

9
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:39,560
-Today we will talk about income.
 -Yes.

10
00:00:39,640 --> 00:00:42,880
-You really like income.
 -You too.

11
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:45,600
-You are crazy in income.
 -No, you are.

12
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:49,160
I like expenses.

13
00:00:49,240 --> 00:00:53,280
-Do you know which ones earn the least?
 -Women.

14
00:00:53,360 --> 00:01:01,040
That's right.
 According to Statistics Sweden, the average salary for women is 35,100.

15
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:06,560
And for men: 39,000. Boring.

16
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:11,840
-Very.
 -A structural societal problems in part.

17
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:18,480
We should not talk about that here.
 We teach both men and women to maximize their income-

18
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:23,120
-So that you can have a safer life and earn some penny here and there.

19
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:30,280
That's right, but things can be done yourself to reduce the gap ...

20
00:01:30,360 --> 00:01:35,640
-Jeimability?
 -Yes.
 When you want to create a family ...

21
00:01:35,720 --> 00:01:39,560
... you should also talk about how you want it within the family.

22
00:01:39,640 --> 00:01:45,760
You discuss parental allowance, try to share equally on parental leave ...

23
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:51,600
Vab and those parts ... how much you are away from the labor market often determine-

24
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:56,440
-How much lower salary you receive.
 And it remains to the pension.

25
00:01:56,520 --> 00:02:00,040
A little tip.
 What should we talk about more?

26
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:04,200
About negotiating and also about investing.

27
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:09,280
The red thread is to try to do more of what you already have.

28
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:14,680
-And make better use of it.
 -My large income is of course the salary.

29
00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:19,880
What can you do about it?
 Is it as it is?

30
00:02:19,960 --> 00:02:27,240
Both.
 You should start talking about the salary.
 Taboo in Sweden.
 We hardly do it ...

31
00:02:27,320 --> 00:02:30,000
-. even with our partner.
 -Who should I talk to?

32
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:33,720
With friends, colleagues and test ... Is your salary good?

33
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:40,120
With my colleagues I should not talk.
 It creates a boring atmosphere at work.

34
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:42,280
-Is it not so anyway?
 -No.

35
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:48,440
Many people wonder about colleagues' salary.
 That's a problem.

36
00:02:48,520 --> 00:02:51,560
Sure you can choose to talk to some-

37
00:02:51,640 --> 00:02:56,360
-But you have to get a feeling for the possibility of improvement.

38
00:02:56,440 --> 00:03:00,880
And who benefits from not talking about the salary?

39
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:04,560
-The employer.
 -Yes, and you're probably losing it.

40
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:10,600
In order for you to receive incentives to negotiate wage-

41
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:15,760
-with the employer and see if you can get other benefits ...

42
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:20,440
... you have to start somewhere.
 And then you need to know how you are.

43
00:03:20,520 --> 00:03:25,400
"How to negotiate your salary."
 Many such tips are available.

44
00:03:25,480 --> 00:03:33,440
I never succeed.
 The manager says how much I get according to the collective agreement.

45
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:40,760
And then it is.
 I say: Yes, but he earns Si and she so ...

46
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:43,520
"Yes, but this is what is there."

47
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:47,400
Do you know that there is nothing more to negotiate, it is good.

48
00:03:47,480 --> 00:03:52,400
Then you can choose.
 "Is it good enough or should I go somewhere else?"

49
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:57,720
The choice is yours.
 If you choose to remain, you have chosen it.

50
00:03:57,800 --> 00:04:01,320
You choose to be satisfied with what you have.

51
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:05,840
I tried to change it, it couldn't, but I choose to stay.

52
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:08,800
Just that, you have to do it.
 Not be bitter.

53
00:04:08,880 --> 00:04:12,200
-Just.
 -Lite bitter coffee, maybe?

54
00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:15,640
No, but good coffee.

55
00:04:20,440 --> 00:04:24,560
It was the salary and some ways to raise it.

56
00:04:24,640 --> 00:04:28,760
But you also have some money that lies and lurks at home.

57
00:04:28,840 --> 00:04:30,920
-Som just lies there ... -Absolutely.

58
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,200
How much do you have in the wind?

59
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:39,280
Around 15,000 or more we have on average in the wind or in the basement-

60
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:42,600
-What could be realized.
 Not bad.

61
00:04:42,680 --> 00:04:48,920
In the short term, but I want to talk about something else ... in the long term.

62
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:54,600
To invest and make money from it.

63
00:04:54,680 --> 00:05:03,520
-Gold, art and the stock exchange ... complicated.
 -Many invest in their home.

64
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:07,200
-Right?
 -A fat investment.

65
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:13,880
Yes, but also very important.
 It has increased much in value to many.

66
00:05:13,960 --> 00:05:18,240
When you buy in the long term.
 We are not talking about speculation here.

67
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:22,760
-You live there while it increases in value.
 -Taken question.

68
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:28,200
"For how much can I rent out ..."

69
00:05:28,280 --> 00:05:34,640
An apartment or villa, I guess ... "... without having to tax?"

70
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:40,200
Taxes do you have done something good, right?
 You have made a profit.

71
00:05:40,280 --> 00:05:45,480
So it is not wrong to tax.
 An apartment must you check if you are allowed to rent out-

72
00:05:45,560 --> 00:05:50,440
-Shelvation The condominium ... You can't always rent a rental right either.

73
00:05:50,520 --> 00:05:55,040
But you can rent a villa or summer cottage.
 Up to around 50,000-

74
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:58,120
-Can you earn tax -free per year.

75
00:05:58,200 --> 00:06:01,760
For exceeding amount, you tax a small sum.

76
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:05,120
-Believe, you think.
 -Right?
 Also an income.

77
00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:08,480
That can be compared to salary or as an addition ...

78
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:11,480
Make money on what you already have.
 That's the thing.

79
00:06:11,560 --> 00:06:17,200
I have learned a lot today.
 One should not be afraid to talk about salary.

80
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:25,720
With friends and ... colleagues.
 Only the employer benefits from not doing so.

81
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:31,240
And if you do not receive increased salary, you can get other compensation.

82
00:06:31,320 --> 00:06:34,360
-Absolutely.
 -The holiday ... or you change jobs.

83
00:06:34,440 --> 00:06:38,200
Begin to keep in mind that the opportunity may exist.

84
00:06:38,280 --> 00:06:44,000
And we got a boring reminder of the lack of equality.

85
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:47,760
And you can rent out or sell stuff.

86
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:52,840
And that quite a lot of money is at home that you can realize in this way.

87
00:06:52,920 --> 00:06:57,120
-What are tied today, but as you can ... -bound money that just lies.

88
00:06:57,200 --> 00:07:00,240
Good and educational.
 - Tjing.

89
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:03,800
Do you know what I came up with?
 You can borrow stuff too.

90
00:07:03,880 --> 00:07:11,360
Fantastic.
 Borrow or rent yourself when you are going to do something.
 You don't have to own everything.
