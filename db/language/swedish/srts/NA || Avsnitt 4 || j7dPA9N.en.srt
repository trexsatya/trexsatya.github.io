Gothenburg's best Somalis - Assia Dahir.

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:41.800
And last, but also absolutely at the longest in the studio - Ahmed Berhan.

11
00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:46.520
You look at the program which is messier than a Polish parliament.

12
00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:52.560
Quiz about all culture in Sweden.
 Here are our fantastic competitors.

13
00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:57.080
Next to me we have the poding midwife Manda.

14
00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:03.160
Next to it we have the ticticing snuff enthusiast Zoofie.

15
00:01:04.560 --> 00:01:09.560
And last: a blast from the past!
 The champion's champion is back.

16
00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:12.720
The power pack from Gottsunda - Patrick!

17
00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:19.800
This program goes like this: The contestants choose one in the panel -

18
00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:25.200
- As I ask another question.
 Then they list if the panelist is lying.

19
00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:31.360
Sorry, are you called Amanda or Manda?
 Is it a "cool" abbreviation?

20
00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:36.120
Hems her Scanian: No, no "cool" abbreviation.

21
00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:42.400
Now she drives!

22
00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:47.520
I apologize, Manda.
 Which of our panelists do you start talking to?

23
00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:50.680
- Filip.
 - Hello, Manda!

24
00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:59.240
In Indonesia, there may be a ban on newlyweds.
 Which?

25
00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:03.560
You must not go to the toilet in three days after the marriage.

26
00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:09.560
It's an old tradition.
 If you can do it, the marriage will be happy.

27
00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:14.080
I don't know if they get unhappy by pooping on ...

28
00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:21.120
It sounds completely unlikely that you would ... like gas ... no.

29
00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:26.400
You don't think it's true?
 You think Filip is lying to you.

30
00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:30.000
You don't know how expensive wedding food is.

31
00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:34.640
It's about keeping it in the stomach.
 Because that's true!

32
00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:43.640
Unfortunately, there will be no points.
 What Filip said is true.

33
00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:48.840
The bridal couple should keep from going to the toilet for three days.

34
00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:54.400
Among today's Indoneser, however, few do this - lactose and whatnot -

35
00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:57.560
- But many people are joking about it.

36
00:02:57.720 --> 00:03:01.600
- Zoofie.
 -Hello.

37
00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:04.760
- What do you want to talk to?
 - Koverski.

38
00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:10.840
- I feel it is my brother.
 - We have two strange names.
 Zoofie ...

39
00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:15.800
- Do you really sofie?
 - No, Zoofie.
 It is just spelled skewed.

40
00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:19.360
- Why do you spell it in "Blattiska"?
 - I am so called.

41
00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:23.360
-Where are you from?
 -Zoo...

42
00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:29.160
Kaminski, my Polish brother - Oliver Ingrosso from Wish.

43
00:03:29.320 --> 00:03:31.760
You know that!

44
00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:36.320
I might inherit a little.
 Hope!

45
00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:41.640
Welcome to IFS, Brother.
 It's your debut, and your first question is:

46
00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:49.440
It is to wash Swedish floors.

47
00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:56.560
Nämen, the tradition ... it's during Easter, zoofie -

48
00:03:56.720 --> 00:04:01.760
-And it's called Smigus-Dyngus.
 Strange, but then we pronounce it.

49
00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:06.560
You throw water at each other.
 Today everyone throws at each other -

50
00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:10.520
-But in the 16th century only threw boys at women-

51
00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:14.600
- To show interest: "I like you."

52
00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:19.880
- They couldn't make them wet otherwise.
 -Just.
 "Are you wet for me now?"

53
00:04:20.040 --> 00:04:25.880
We may not start the Wet T-shirt concept- but you are welcome.

54
00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:29.240
- Zoofie?
 - Well, please!

55
00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:33.920
This sounds so unreasonable that it can be true.

56
00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:37.480
I want to believe that you speak the truth.

57
00:04:37.640 --> 00:04:40.640
-Do it.
 - I say it's true.

58
00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:44.640
You believe in the Polish tradition Smigus-Dyngus?

59
00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:47.760
Smigus-Dyngus!
 Absolutely right, Ahmed.

60
00:04:47.920 --> 00:04:52.200
Do you know what, zoofie?
 Congratulations to your first point.

61
00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:56.960
Bravo, Zoofie!

62
00:04:57.120 --> 00:05:02.520
It's true.
 Poland's contribution to world culture-Smigus-Dyngus-

63
00:05:02.680 --> 00:05:07.560
- Is an Easter tradition where Poles throw water at each other.

64
00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:13.480
- Patrick, Patrick, Patrick.
 - Patrick!

65
00:05:16.120 --> 00:05:19.720
- You know how this goes, so ... —Minika.

66
00:05:19.880 --> 00:05:22.840
-Good evening!
 -Hello.

67
00:05:23.840 --> 00:05:27.680
Dominika, who is known as the king of Rinkeby?

68
00:05:27.840 --> 00:05:32.560
It is an old man who has lived there about since it was built.

69
00:05:32.720 --> 00:05:38.200
He likes to go to a hamburger restaurant and has received a penny.

70
00:05:38.360 --> 00:05:41.320
You might not say the brand.

71
00:05:41.480 --> 00:05:45.880
He appeals to himself in Vi-form as plural's majestatis.

72
00:05:46.040 --> 00:05:51.760
He smokes two cig too, one in each hand.
 He has written on petitions -

73
00:05:51.920 --> 00:05:56.760
- To rename Rinkeby Square to King's square.

74
00:05:56.920 --> 00:06:01.720
But it has not been so yet, unfortunately.
 He is very popular locally.

75
00:06:01.880 --> 00:06:07.640
He thinks he is "Royal" for real, though he is not.

76
00:06:07.800 --> 00:06:11.000
- I think it's false.
 -Why?

77
00:06:11.160 --> 00:06:15.920
You can't see Shonon walking around with a crown from a hamburger restaurant?

78
00:06:16.080 --> 00:06:20.280
-I do not think so.
 - You think she is lying to you.

79
00:06:20.440 --> 00:06:25.280
Patrick, you continue the victory train.
 Congratulations to your first point.

80
00:06:27.160 --> 00:06:31.320
It's false.
 Real estate mogul Mikael Andersson -

81
00:06:31.480 --> 00:06:35.440
–A which owned a lot of properties in mainly Rinkeby and Husby -

82
00:06:35.600 --> 00:06:39.080
- Went under the name King of Rinkeby.

83
00:06:42.840 --> 00:06:46.520
- Manda, who do you put your cards on?
 –Alaf.

84
00:06:46.680 --> 00:06:49.200
Elaf, we watch a video question.

85
00:06:56.120 --> 00:06:59.080
Type African Braveheart.

86
00:07:00.680 --> 00:07:06.240
First and foremost - African Braveheart is Black Panthers.

87
00:07:06.400 --> 00:07:10.360
Just ... what was it we looked at?

88
00:07:10.520 --> 00:07:14.560
Well, what we saw is Afghanistan's national sport -

89
00:07:14.720 --> 00:07:20.680
— Which is called buzkashi and is based on two teams meeting each other -

90
00:07:20.840 --> 00:07:25.360
- Because riding horses and trying to score goals.

91
00:07:25.520 --> 00:07:30.880
But instead of scoring a goal with a ball or a puck-

92
00:07:31.040 --> 00:07:34.160
- They use a dead goat.

93
00:07:35.520 --> 00:07:38.200
- Najs!
 - A dead goat?

94
00:07:38.360 --> 00:07:42.400
- It's Afghanistan.
 -Right.
 Premise!

95
00:07:42.560 --> 00:07:46.880
Yes, it could in itself match.

96
00:07:47.040 --> 00:07:51.040
- What do you say, Manda?
 -No that is not true.

97
00:07:51.200 --> 00:07:55.960
Not?
 You are in control of Afghan national sports?

98
00:07:56.120 --> 00:07:59.960
That goat bit you into the ass.
 It's true!

99
00:08:00.120 --> 00:08:02.640
No!

100
00:08:05.040 --> 00:08:10.200
Afghanistan's national sport was banned by the Taliban in the 90s-

101
00:08:10.360 --> 00:08:15.040
- Because it was considered immoral.
 Who knew they were animal friends?!

102
00:08:16.200 --> 00:08:19.760
Then when Americans came: "This is fat fun."

103
00:08:19.920 --> 00:08:24.520
So from 2001 it has been legal in Afghanistan again.

104
00:08:24.680 --> 00:08:29.720
- Good that it is not a living goat.
 - Zoofie, who do you choose to talk to?

105
00:08:29.880 --> 00:08:33.400
- I think I can trust Assia.
 --Assia.

106
00:08:33.560 --> 00:08:38.680
In the middle stands environmental engineer Mohamed Hussein Roble.
 Why is he known?

107
00:08:38.840 --> 00:08:43.000
It's Dree Low after he put off with the music.

108
00:08:43.160 --> 00:08:46.160
No I'm joking.
 Zooo-Fie!

109
00:08:46.560 --> 00:08:49.880
Zoofie, this is actually the man -

110
00:08:50.040 --> 00:08:55.400
-As was Greta Thunberg's NO teacher at the Global High School in Stockholm.

111
00:08:55.560 --> 00:09:00.640
It was he who gave her the idea to strike on Fridays for the environment.

112
00:09:00.800 --> 00:09:05.200
-White People turns everything from black!
 -Do you understand?!

113
00:09:09.320 --> 00:09:12.320
Under Black History Month!

114
00:09:12.480 --> 00:09:17.520
In the movie about Greta's life, Roble will be played by Robert Gustafsson.

115
00:09:18.720 --> 00:09:23.640
You could speak the truth, but you could also lie.

116
00:09:23.800 --> 00:09:27.080
- I'm black?!
 -Yes.
 No!

117
00:09:33.640 --> 00:09:37.160
A Freudian "slip"!

118
00:09:37.320 --> 00:09:39.520
Wow!

119
00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:44.800
No, it wasn't so I thought, I promise.

120
00:09:45.840 --> 00:09:51.080
No, I think you are lying.
 I think it's false.

121
00:09:51.240 --> 00:09:55.120
- You choose to think it's false?
 -Yes.

122
00:09:55.280 --> 00:09:59.880
You know what?
 Congratulations!
 You just got one more point.

123
00:10:04.320 --> 00:10:07.880
Mohamed is definitely not Greta's NO teacher-

124
00:10:08.040 --> 00:10:12.960
- Soma was Somalia's prime minister between 2020 and 2022. Congratulations!

125
00:10:13.120 --> 00:10:15.560
Patrick ...

126
00:10:17.520 --> 00:10:21.960
- What do you choose?
 - I take the Greek up there.

127
00:10:25.840 --> 00:10:31.240
Thanos ... What kind of coffee does Syrians offer during a memorial?

128
00:10:31.400 --> 00:10:35.240
Okay, see now ...

129
00:10:35.400 --> 00:10:41.040
Baklava, a little cream cake, chocolate cake ...

130
00:10:41.200 --> 00:10:46.160
Then it goes over to a little meze: hummus, lahm bi ajin, queue -

131
00:10:46.320 --> 00:10:53.000
- Grilled chicken, lamb, french fries and a cappuccino.

132
00:10:59.360 --> 00:11:02.560
No, but they have a thing for bran.

133
00:11:02.720 --> 00:11:07.720
They offer bran during the memorial for those who have passed away.

134
00:11:07.880 --> 00:11:12.280
No, I think it's false.
 Semlor is a Svennegrej.

135
00:11:14.640 --> 00:11:18.800
If he only knew who runs all the pastry shops ...

136
00:11:23.920 --> 00:11:25.360
False?

137
00:11:25.520 --> 00:11:29.200
You do that right in. It's not true.

138
00:11:30.880 --> 00:11:36.880
Why make it even more depressing by bidding on bran ...

139
00:11:37.040 --> 00:11:42.600
... when you can bid on pastries?
 It is a snack Syrian offers.

140
00:11:42.760 --> 00:11:48.520
- They die for a fucking pastry.
 - It's better than Semla anyway.

141
00:11:48.680 --> 00:11:53.280
- You have problems with the almond paste?
 - I don't like the proportions.

142
00:11:53.440 --> 00:11:59.240
Why has the worst gut and so small head?
 Understanding!

143
00:11:59.400 --> 00:12:02.400
It's haesh ...

144
00:12:05.920 --> 00:12:09.720
He identifies himself with it: "This is my people!"

145
00:12:09.880 --> 00:12:13.160
- Congratulations to your point, Patrick.
 -Thanks.

146
00:12:15.600 --> 00:12:21.160
Manda, you stare at the panel and know for sure who you want to talk to.

147
00:12:21.320 --> 00:12:25.120
- You must not choose.
 Do you know why?
 -No.

148
00:12:25.280 --> 00:12:29.240
You have received a letter - a letter from Botkyrka.

149
00:12:34.840 --> 00:12:39.440
Here is one of Botkyrka's most popular sandwiches, with two ingredients:

150
00:12:39.600 --> 00:12:42.800
Cheese and this Turkish sausage.

151
00:12:42.960 --> 00:12:46.960
Is it true that the sausage is called suck cock?

152
00:12:56.000 --> 00:13:00.480
–As he "angry" or "suck"?
 - Sucking.

153
00:13:01.840 --> 00:13:06.440
- Well, why not?!
 - More strange things have happened there?

154
00:13:06.600 --> 00:13:10.080
- It must have done.
 -You are absolutely right.

155
00:13:10.240 --> 00:13:12.880
It is called suck cock.

156
00:13:14.440 --> 00:13:17.480
It is a Turkish sausage called Sucuk.

157
00:13:17.640 --> 00:13:22.640
But in Botkyrka, in the people's mouth - no pun intended -

158
00:13:22.800 --> 00:13:25.800
- It is called for suck cock.
 Exactly!

159
00:13:25.960 --> 00:13:29.240
What is it...?

160
00:13:31.120 --> 00:13:35.760
You rarely see a woman making this reaction to suck cock: "Yes!"

161
00:13:35.920 --> 00:13:39.720
- Zoofie, should we move on to you?
 -Yes.
 Evelyn.

162
00:13:39.880 --> 00:13:43.080
You want Evelyn.

163
00:13:44.800 --> 00:13:47.600
–Evelyn.
 -Hello!

164
00:13:47.760 --> 00:13:52.880
- You may have heard a Chinese ... - Yes, I've heard many Chinese.

165
00:13:53.040 --> 00:13:57.200
- Then you have heard them say "nei ga".
 - mm.

166
00:13:58.200 --> 00:14:02.920
Say it, Evelyn!
 I ask you, say that!
 I am waiting...

167
00:14:03.080 --> 00:14:07.120
-What does it mean?
 - Who was in Paris?
 Say!

168
00:14:12.200 --> 00:14:16.120
It is not pronounced that way.
 It is pronounced "Nage".

169
00:14:16.280 --> 00:14:21.240
Here you get an "N-Word Pass".
 Say it once!

170
00:14:21.400 --> 00:14:24.360
I'm kidding, give it!

171
00:14:27.120 --> 00:14:30.720
It's a Chinese word, and a nasty word -

172
00:14:30.880 --> 00:14:35.120
- But it's not as you think it was.

173
00:14:35.280 --> 00:14:40.800
It is ... nei ga is like ... it means kind of horny, you can say -

174
00:14:40.960 --> 00:14:44.920
–Fast ten times worse.
 So it's kind of like this ...

175
00:14:45.080 --> 00:14:49.200
If you say it means that kind of that ... yours ...

176
00:14:49.360 --> 00:14:53.520
-To the point!
 -She doesn't want to happen to say the n-word.

177
00:14:53.680 --> 00:14:57.680
- I focus!
 -She just: "It's called ne-ne ..."

178
00:14:57.840 --> 00:15:00.360
Danish pastry!

179
00:15:07.200 --> 00:15:11.800
If you get called it then it means -

180
00:15:11.960 --> 00:15:17.520
- That your mother's mother's mother's mother was a horn.
 You got out of her ...

181
00:15:17.680 --> 00:15:22.160
Everyone who has come out of there, all generations, is whores.

182
00:15:22.320 --> 00:15:29.480
Do you believe in Evelyn?
 Being a generational Horozpu çocugu?

183
00:15:29.640 --> 00:15:32.560
- It's probably false.
 - You think that?

184
00:15:32.720 --> 00:15:37.720
That it does not mean at all Evelyn just has Claimat.

185
00:15:37.880 --> 00:15:41.240
You just got 1 point.

186
00:15:42.680 --> 00:15:45.840
It is not at all a swearing.

187
00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:50.000
It is a fill word: "the", "where" or "it".

188
00:15:50.160 --> 00:15:55.440
That's why you use it in Chinese rap: "Neigga, please!"

189
00:15:58.440 --> 00:16:02.440
- Patrick, your third question.
 - Big O.

190
00:16:04.920 --> 00:16:06.440
Big o ...

191
00:16:10.360 --> 00:16:13.360
Paolo Roberto and Niklas Wahlgren.

192
00:16:13.520 --> 00:16:17.200
- You said yeah, huh?
 -Rapper!

193
00:16:25.480 --> 00:16:30.800
No, but it was Sebbe Staxx and Leo "Chinese" from the cartel.

194
00:16:30.960 --> 00:16:34.520
It was about knuckling, giggled and nagging ...

195
00:16:34.680 --> 00:16:39.440
It became Mizeria - they ended up sliding.
 It was a special number-

196
00:16:39.600 --> 00:16:44.240
- Made together with BRIS, which was called Anchor from the resort.

197
00:16:51.280 --> 00:16:54.400
- Patrick?
 - I think it's false.

198
00:16:54.560 --> 00:16:58.400
- False?
 Patrick, Patrick, Patrick ... - I'm wrong?

199
00:16:58.560 --> 00:17:03.520
Absolutely not!
 You never stop taking points.
 Congratulations to one more!

200
00:17:04.680 --> 00:17:08.200
The two rappers on the Kalle Duck cover-

201
00:17:08.360 --> 00:17:12.320
- no less than the Stockholm legends Ison & amp;
 Fille.

202
00:17:14.720 --> 00:17:18.880
As you can see, it was called Ison & amp;
 Fille in Ankeborg.

203
00:17:19.040 --> 00:17:23.760
Awesome work, zoofie and Patrick.
 - Manda, thank you for joining.

204
00:17:23.920 --> 00:17:28.840
It was great fun to have you here.
 - Now it's time for the duel.

205
00:17:32.800 --> 00:17:37.040
The duel goes like this: I'm a single ruler -

206
00:17:37.200 --> 00:17:42.640
- So can no longer choose a panelist, but I choose two for you.

207
00:17:42.800 --> 00:17:46.280
One tells the truth and the other lying -

208
00:17:46.440 --> 00:17:51.600
- And you should decide who it is that tells the truth.
 Jalla, then we drive!

209
00:17:54.040 --> 00:17:58.080
Zoofie, you start.
 You get a prime duo to work with.

210
00:17:58.240 --> 00:18:01.200
No less than Thanos and Assia!

211
00:18:03.720 --> 00:18:06.960
From Botkyrka to Gbg, Thanos and Assia.

212
00:18:07.120 --> 00:18:10.200
What does "Yep" mean?

213
00:18:10.360 --> 00:18:14.480
Yep means, among other things, having intercourse.

214
00:18:14.640 --> 00:18:18.680
To have sex.
 FUCK.

215
00:18:19.680 --> 00:18:22.640
Oh, someone went clear sfi!

216
00:18:23.920 --> 00:18:27.120
Don't listen to Infinity Gauntlet.

217
00:18:27.280 --> 00:18:31.760
What it really means is that ...

218
00:18:31.920 --> 00:18:37.720
It's a verb.
 It comes from Turkish Yapçemi ...

219
00:18:37.880 --> 00:18:43.960
... and that means help in all its bends.

220
00:18:44.120 --> 00:18:49.800
For example: "Damn, I have to yeah dad in the garage because he needs help."

221
00:18:49.960 --> 00:18:53.000
Or: "Please, can you yeah me?"

222
00:18:54.440 --> 00:18:58.360
Why are you laughing?
 Never have yeah any?!

223
00:18:59.720 --> 00:19:04.760
- Zoofie.
 - I know that Thanos speaks the truth.

224
00:19:04.920 --> 00:19:09.000
I've heard it more times than I wanted -

225
00:19:09.160 --> 00:19:12.960
- For the preschool class for grade two.

226
00:19:13.120 --> 00:19:16.680
–And they talk about it?!
 -Yes.

227
00:19:16.840 --> 00:19:21.040
"Zoofie, if you fuck my grades I will yeah you."

228
00:19:27.160 --> 00:19:30.880
You choose to believe in thanos-

229
00:19:31.040 --> 00:19:35.520
- And of course you are doing just right in. Congratulations, Zoofie!

230
00:19:36.600 --> 00:19:41.800
Yep has a double meaning depending on tone:

231
00:19:41.960 --> 00:19:46.520
"Should we yeah?"
 Or: "I will yeah you, do you understand?!"

232
00:19:46.680 --> 00:19:50.240
Everything is in the emphasis.

233
00:19:50.400 --> 00:19:54.480
Patrick, are you ready to yeah a point?

234
00:19:54.640 --> 00:19:57.960
- Yeah!
 –Yes?

235
00:20:04.400 --> 00:20:09.360
Patrick, the two competitors you should talk to are Big O and Elaf.

236
00:20:13.920 --> 00:20:17.400
When to use this hand gesture?

237
00:20:20.560 --> 00:20:25.520
This hand gesture is used ...

238
00:20:25.680 --> 00:20:29.760
In Sweden you do not talk so much to the hands -

239
00:20:29.920 --> 00:20:36.600
- But we from warmer latitudes do.
 This is kind of so: "huh?!"

240
00:20:36.760 --> 00:20:41.080
It is when you do not take anything, or so: "Really?!"

241
00:20:41.240 --> 00:20:43.880
Kind of like that.

242
00:20:44.040 --> 00:20:48.240
Brother, when you do so, it means: "How much is the time?"

243
00:20:48.400 --> 00:20:52.520
But when you do, it's hot, brother.
 Incitement against sofa group.

244
00:20:52.680 --> 00:20:57.600
- horse against sofa group.
 - "Horse against sofa group" - I said it.

245
00:20:57.760 --> 00:21:02.000
Then brother, you are going to the cent and meet a mush.

246
00:21:02.160 --> 00:21:06.160
Brother, the time!
 You stand 200 meters, I just: "Brrr!"

247
00:21:06.320 --> 00:21:10.080
It's the time, brother.
 Time is Money, brother.

248
00:21:10.240 --> 00:21:15.360
So this is "what is the time"?
 As for a round circle?

249
00:21:15.520 --> 00:21:20.600
- Not 360 ... 90.
 -Not like that?

250
00:21:20.760 --> 00:21:25.480
- type "it's half six"?
 - But ... - Are you done?

251
00:21:25.640 --> 00:21:29.640
Thank you so much for your monologues and your answers.

252
00:21:29.800 --> 00:21:33.240
-What are you saying?
 - I am completely confused.

253
00:21:33.400 --> 00:21:36.360
Big O says, "How much is it?"

254
00:21:36.520 --> 00:21:40.120
Elaf says it is when you are confused: "huh?!"

255
00:21:40.280 --> 00:21:44.200
- Are you on Big O or Elaf?
 –Alaf.

256
00:21:44.360 --> 00:21:48.080
- You believe in Elaf?
 - We drive on Elaf.

257
00:21:48.240 --> 00:21:51.760
You got 1 point, yes!

258
00:21:53.520 --> 00:21:58.520
You use it when someone does something scary or you get confused.

259
00:21:58.680 --> 00:22:02.000
Cruelly!
 Congratulations to your score.
 - Zoofie ...

260
00:22:03.560 --> 00:22:08.040
You will now get a whole Polish buffet, for your two competitors -

261
00:22:08.200 --> 00:22:11.760
- Is Dominika and Kaminski.

262
00:22:12.400 --> 00:22:15.880
Mizeria comes from the Polish -

263
00:22:16.040 --> 00:22:20.640
-And is used as a hose for "misery".
 But what does it really mean?

264
00:22:20.800 --> 00:22:25.120
This is how you describe Anders and Dominika's marriage.

265
00:22:25.280 --> 00:22:28.520
Mizeria is also in Poland ...

266
00:22:28.680 --> 00:22:33.040
- She didn't even deny it.
 - She just kept going!

267
00:22:33.200 --> 00:22:38.080
Mizeria is Mizeria.
 But in this case it is about -

268
00:22:38.240 --> 00:22:45.240
- A cucumber that is so beaten when it ends up in a cucumber salad ...

269
00:22:45.400 --> 00:22:50.720
From the beginning it was a stubborn western cucumber, hard and fresh.

270
00:22:50.880 --> 00:22:54.120
Then you plan it so incredibly thin -

271
00:22:54.280 --> 00:22:58.320
- That it becomes like a leached old scrub.

272
00:22:58.480 --> 00:23:04.000
A complete misery condition.
 Good salad, despite the name.
 Mizeria!

273
00:23:04.160 --> 00:23:08.840
- Two poles and who is lying ...?
 - It is carved as stuck.

274
00:23:09.000 --> 00:23:12.120
Exactly.
 But believe in me now.

275
00:23:12.280 --> 00:23:16.480
Mizeria is a Polish birthday tradition.

276
00:23:16.640 --> 00:23:22.560
The birthday child sits in the middle, then everyone dances around in arm hook.

277
00:23:22.720 --> 00:23:26.320
Finally, you fall into the birthday child.

278
00:23:26.480 --> 00:23:31.800
It should symbolize the misery around you, but the family always takes care of you.

279
00:23:31.960 --> 00:23:35.920
- Type A Polish Böghög?
 -Exactly!

280
00:23:38.160 --> 00:23:43.040
Do you think it's a cucumber salad or a Polish birthday tradition?

281
00:23:43.200 --> 00:23:46.240
Please, I don't want to answer this.

282
00:23:46.400 --> 00:23:50.800
You said I would trust you.
 But it sounds unreasonable -

283
00:23:50.960 --> 00:23:55.640
- And Dominika nodded when Kaminski answered, so he probably speaks the truth.

284
00:23:55.800 --> 00:24:02.240
- So Dominika revealed themselves?
 - Yes, you nodded when he talked.

285
00:24:02.400 --> 00:24:06.880
- I nodded because he is lying.
 - I have chosen him.

286
00:24:07.040 --> 00:24:13.280
Great, don't listen to the pole, listen to the pole!
 Great.

287
00:24:15.640 --> 00:24:18.600
Zoofie, you trusted Kaminski.

288
00:24:18.760 --> 00:24:21.960
But Dominika gave you the truth.

289
00:24:22.120 --> 00:24:25.160
Mizeria is a Polish cucumber salad.

290
00:24:29.120 --> 00:24:33.680
Patrick, right now it stands 1-1.

291
00:24:33.840 --> 00:24:39.720
If you take this question home, you win.
 Otherwise, it will be a matter of rash.

292
00:24:39.880 --> 00:24:44.560
You will of course receive the last duo: Filip and Evelyn.

293
00:24:44.720 --> 00:24:48.280
BAM-BAM-BAAAM!

294
00:24:48.440 --> 00:24:52.080
So ... xin!

295
00:24:52.240 --> 00:24:56.480
Fight!
 Filip and Evelyn.
 Salty bae in all glory-

296
00:24:56.640 --> 00:25:03.000
- But Turks also salt in something called Isik.
 What do you salt?

297
00:25:03.160 --> 00:25:08.160
Turks salt, among other things.
 children in the hope that when these children grow up -

298
00:25:08.320 --> 00:25:14.640
- They do not smell of bad sweat smell.

299
00:25:14.800 --> 00:25:18.520
What are you going to say?
 What do you know about Turks, the man?

300
00:25:18.680 --> 00:25:21.720
- I've been to Alanya.
 -Oh!

301
00:25:22.880 --> 00:25:28.640
- The whitest Evelyn has said!
 - "I've been to Skärholmen."

302
00:25:28.800 --> 00:25:35.800
Nämen, okay ... The thing is like this: In Turkey, dogs ...

303
00:25:35.960 --> 00:25:41.000
In Turkey and some Muslim countries, dogs are considered to be a dirty animal.

304
00:25:41.160 --> 00:25:45.320
Unlike in China, where it is a good animal.

305
00:25:47.520 --> 00:25:50.480
I knew it!

306
00:25:53.680 --> 00:25:55.760
Rappappa!

307
00:25:55.920 --> 00:25:59.400
As in Asian countries, one salt their dogs -

308
00:25:59.560 --> 00:26:04.800
- But then you do it in Turkey because the dog is a dirty animal.

309
00:26:04.960 --> 00:26:09.280
So you usually have a small vessel with salt at the door -

310
00:26:09.440 --> 00:26:14.320
- So that the dog is allowed to put the paws in the salt vessel to be purified.

311
00:26:14.480 --> 00:26:18.480
That is a fucking Chinese beauty cure.
 Listen!

312
00:26:18.640 --> 00:26:23.440
But yours, then!
 Salt babies.
 We eat dogs, not babies.

313
00:26:23.600 --> 00:26:28.680
The salt is placed on the child so that they can smell less sweat and older.

314
00:26:28.840 --> 00:26:32.200
Then you slide them in the oven!

315
00:26:36.400 --> 00:26:41.640
The best part is that you both behave like you have a normal answer.

316
00:26:41.800 --> 00:26:46.960
Like one of you is more logical than the other.
 - Patrick, good luck!

317
00:26:47.880 --> 00:26:53.800
The dogs probably don't even come in.
 So I believe in Filip.

318
00:26:53.960 --> 00:26:58.880
- You don't think the dogs come in?
 - You don't think they come into the house?

319
00:26:59.040 --> 00:27:03.560
- They are dirty and do not come in.
 - Not alive anyway!

320
00:27:03.720 --> 00:27:10.320
You believe in Filip: Turks salt babies - not dogs - not

321
00:27:10.480 --> 00:27:14.320
- In hope that they will not smell sweat.

322
00:27:14.480 --> 00:27:18.240
Yes, the man!
 Congratulations, you got one more point.

323
00:27:18.400 --> 00:27:23.040
Isik is an old Turkish tradition where the baby was used.

324
00:27:23.200 --> 00:27:28.480
It was hoped it would stop smelling sweat, and be long and be lucky.
