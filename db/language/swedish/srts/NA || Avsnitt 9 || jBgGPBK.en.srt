1
00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:41.080
I'm too full.
 You can drive!

2
00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:56.280
- Britt!
 Hello!
 -Hello!

3
00:01:56.440 --> 00:02:01.080
-It was a long time ago!
 So you're here?
 -Yes.

4
00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:06.800
- And you're here and Saturday shopping.
 - Yes, you have to.

5
00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:11.560
Do you know, I would buy vacuum cleaner bags.

6
00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:18.360
It's so difficult!
 They do not have the right bags for Voltan we have at home.

7
00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:26.040
I said this: Make the same bag for all vacuum cleaners!

8
00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:31.000
- It would have been much better!
 - Well!

9
00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:35.320
- Be so good and get up again.
 -Ouch...

10
00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:41.080
Does the pain feel all the time or just sometimes?

11
00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:45.680
No, they feel all the time.

12
00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:50.480
Here is an X -ray of your abdominal cavity.

13
00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:54.720
Everything looks normal except this.

14
00:02:54.880 --> 00:03:01.160
- It's probably the cause of the pain.
 -What is it?

15
00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:07.360
It's a golf shoe that you have down here.
 You see the spikes in the sole.

16
00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:14.600
It's probably the plows.
 It seems to be a left shoe.

17
00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:20.360
It is not dangerous, but of course feels a little uncomfortable.

18
00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:27.360
- Is it relevant with surgery?
 - I think we wait a bit.

19
00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:31.960
It can come out the natural path.

20
00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:35.920
We wait and see, I think.

21
00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:39.560
How nice you are in your hair, Inger!

22
00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:44.720
-Are you still going to Maj-Lis?
 - On the caluf, yes.

23
00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:49.840
I was with her and made foil loops.

24
00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:56.680
- But it became completely wrong shade!
 - Night, you say?!

25
00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:03.200
Stop the car!
 What the hell is it with you?

26
00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:09.200
You drive like a rake!
 It was one -way over there!

27
00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:15.400
You almost drove on the aunt!
 Is it certain that you have not been drinking?

28
00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:38.720
Look!
 Do you see what I see, Per-Arne?

29
00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:47.840
- Is it a bear?
 - It stands a bear in the square!

30
00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:53.760
- We should take a picture, Carita.
 - Yeah!

31
00:04:54.760 --> 00:04:59.960
Typical!
 Once we have tried GHB for the first time -

32
00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:07.920
- Then there is a bear in the square and I am too spinning for taking cards.

33
00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:12.800
It's our usual bad luck!

34
00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:16.600
Do you have the man with you too!

35
00:05:16.760 --> 00:05:21.360
- Hallå, Inger!
 -Nice to see you!

36
00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:28.200
- They only had little after eight.
 - You've been away for 20 minutes!

37
00:05:28.360 --> 00:05:35.720
- men can't shop.
 - No, they can't.

38
00:05:35.880 --> 00:05:42.840
- Should you have foreign?
 - Mulla Omar and his new wife are coming.

39
00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:46.760
He is so fond of After Eight.

40
00:05:46.920 --> 00:05:53.280
Last time he was at home he ate all up!

41
00:05:53.440 --> 00:05:58.520
Do you know what, Inger?
 He has problems with the prostate.

42
00:05:58.680 --> 00:06:01.840
You shouldn't talk about it.

43
00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:09.800
Last time he was at our house he went on a toilet eight times!

44
00:06:09.960 --> 00:06:16.200
- Now we will shop further, Inger!
 -Have a nice day!

45
00:06:16.360 --> 00:06:24.240
- What should we have for starters, then?
 - They had Skagen stir on coupon.

46
00:06:25.400 --> 00:06:31.400
What the hell are you on me for?
 It was he who drove!
 I am a passenger.

47
00:06:31.560 --> 00:06:34.760
Give him a fine!

48
00:06:38.760 --> 00:06:43.320
Have you tried anervan that I wrote out?

49
00:06:43.480 --> 00:06:48.480
I didn't think it had any major effect.

50
00:06:48.640 --> 00:06:54.080
Here is the X -ray image.
 You have had a headache.

51
00:06:54.240 --> 00:06:59.200
We have not found any tumor, which is lucky.

52
00:06:59.360 --> 00:07:05.160
But there is something little here between the brain halves.

53
00:07:05.320 --> 00:07:11.120
It's a small, small drum set you have here.

54
00:07:11.280 --> 00:07:18.920
You see the hi-hat to the right, here are three hanging pieces and double baskets.

55
00:07:19.080 --> 00:07:22.600
When you feel pain in the head-

56
00:07:22.760 --> 00:07:30.320
- Then there is probably a small, little guy here and drives on by just hell.

57
00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:35.760
Is that normal, right?

58
00:07:35.920 --> 00:07:41.280
It is not very common.
 You can't say that.

59
00:08:00.320 --> 00:08:06.160
Conny, don't put the tomatoes in the bottom of the bag!

60
00:08:06.320 --> 00:08:13.120
He is hopeless!
 I wanted tacos, but he says he can't tolerate them.

61
00:08:13.280 --> 00:08:20.960
I think Mozzarella and Pesto are good, but he can't stand it.

62
00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:28.960
Do you know what he said?
 That he gets heartburn.

63
00:08:29.120 --> 00:08:33.120
So yes!
 We will have twenty.

64
00:08:34.480 --> 00:08:39.600
We will talk about something that we men love - hunting.

65
00:08:39.760 --> 00:08:45.640
- Hunting on brides, right?
 - Hey, you just think of brides!

66
00:08:45.800 --> 00:08:49.960
Sometimes I think of strong beer too!

67
00:08:50.120 --> 00:08:56.040
No, of course I mean hunting in the forest for wildlife.

68
00:09:00.040 --> 00:09:04.840
Yes, here we sit on a hunter pass.

69
00:09:05.920 --> 00:09:12.760
- You don't coward for a hunter sandwich?
 - No, you get hungry by hunting.

70
00:09:12.920 --> 00:09:19.560
- Can I tempt with a strong beer?
 - I love strong beer!

71
00:09:19.720 --> 00:09:23.200
Here I have sushi.

72
00:09:27.440 --> 00:09:30.960
I have ginger to sushi.

73
00:09:31.120 --> 00:09:34.720
Should we taste this, then?

74
00:09:39.160 --> 00:09:44.760
- It is good with white wine for sushi.
 -I have!

75
00:09:44.920 --> 00:09:48.720
And so I have wet wipes about sushi sticks.

76
00:09:48.880 --> 00:09:55.760
It is important to have proper stuff when chasing.
 Do you have a knife?

77
00:09:57.520 --> 00:10:02.000
No I have not.

78
00:10:02.720 --> 00:10:05.840
I have a garlic press.

79
00:10:06.640 --> 00:10:12.880
- Don't I see like an aunt now?
 -No.

80
00:10:13.040 --> 00:10:16.400
It's nice.

81
00:10:16.560 --> 00:10:20.680
We will look at how your ankle has healed.

82
00:10:20.840 --> 00:10:28.120
Here you see the metal rail sitting along the leg.
 Here are the screws.

83
00:10:28.280 --> 00:10:34.640
Down here you see something that looks like a small fork.

84
00:10:34.800 --> 00:10:39.280
-Do you know what it is?
 -No.

85
00:10:42.040 --> 00:10:47.840
-What is it?
 - I have no pale fat fucking idea.

86
00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:54.960
But I don't think it should look like that.

87
00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:11.040
- What is hunting for you?
 - The most pure nature experience!

88
00:11:11.200 --> 00:11:16.440
The total freedom, where man and nature live in interaction.

89
00:11:16.600 --> 00:11:19.800
The scents, the silence, the silence.

90
00:11:19.960 --> 00:11:24.080
A shot goes off

91
00:11:25.680 --> 00:11:32.040
I will quote one thing Jan Guillou has written.

92
00:11:34.440 --> 00:11:38.400
In "Big Macho book" he writes ...

93
00:11:38.560 --> 00:11:42.280
Should I...?

94
00:11:42.440 --> 00:11:49.080
In "Stora Macho Book" Jan Guillou writes in the chapter "My Hunt":

95
00:11:49.240 --> 00:11:55.200
"In the relationship between me and the deer there is no lie."

96
00:11:55.360 --> 00:12:00.360
"The deer is superior to me in everything - except firepower."

97
00:12:00.520 --> 00:12:04.000
"It's a formidable creature ..."

98
00:12:04.160 --> 00:12:08.480
A shot goes off

99
00:12:11.680 --> 00:12:14.680
Mobile signal

100
00:12:16.360 --> 00:12:19.360
It's mine.

101
00:12:23.200 --> 00:12:27.440
Help me, André.
 How to secure the rifle?

102
00:12:29.320 --> 00:12:33.560
Aj like hell, your fucking ...!

103
00:12:51.600 --> 00:12:55.080
I feel tired and tough today.

104
00:12:55.240 --> 00:12:59.800
I lack energy and feel hopeless.

105
00:12:59.960 --> 00:13:05.800
It feels like I've had a impaired sight.
 I'm foamy -eyed.

106
00:13:05.960 --> 00:13:12.840
Then I got something else strange, hair in the palms.

107
00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:16.520
I don't know what I've done.

108
00:13:16.680 --> 00:13:22.640
Then it is as if my spinal cord has become strange.

109
00:13:24.320 --> 00:13:31.720
- What do you think it is?
 - Have you not done anything special ...?

110
00:13:31.880 --> 00:13:38.280
- With yourself like ...?
 - No, I've been alone this weekend.

111
00:13:38.440 --> 00:13:43.560
I've been lying on the couch ... We just got TV 1000.

112
00:13:43.720 --> 00:13:48.040
I don't know what it might be ...

113
00:13:50.040 --> 00:13:54.120
- Should I pull in the strut for you?
 -No!

114
00:14:08.120 --> 00:14:12.240
- It was no bad cucumber.
 -No...

115
00:14:12.400 --> 00:14:16.880
- What does one cost?
 –39 SEK/kg, it says.

116
00:14:17.040 --> 00:14:25.360
- It was a lot of money.
 - For goods turn so much in price.

117
00:14:25.520 --> 00:14:29.720
Meat does not have the same price fluctuations.

118
00:14:29.880 --> 00:14:37.160
- What do you say about peaches, then?
 - It's delicious, I think.

119
00:14:37.320 --> 00:14:43.480
I usually cook marinated peaches when the guys come to dinner.

120
00:14:43.640 --> 00:14:48.400
Are you going home and watch a real peach?

121
00:14:48.560 --> 00:14:53.120
Now I get a little curious.

122
00:14:53.280 --> 00:14:59.680
Hello, Gullet.
 The lady here wants to invite us home and look at "A real peach".

123
00:14:59.840 --> 00:15:03.720
Exciting!
 Is that something you grow yourself?

124
00:15:03.880 --> 00:15:07.600
It was he who said it ...

125
00:15:07.760 --> 00:15:12.640
I have to go home, I have a bread in the oven ...

126
00:15:12.800 --> 00:15:18.400
- What a lovely aunt!
 - Yes, absolutely wonderful.

127
00:15:18.560 --> 00:15:23.680
Should we give that guy a handle?

128
00:15:23.840 --> 00:15:29.720
I don't put my foot in that pool.
 It is full of bacteria.

129
00:15:29.880 --> 00:15:35.680
Yesterday, a kid kissed in it.
 Imagine so many kids who have done so.

130
00:15:35.840 --> 00:15:40.960
-20 % of the water is certainly pure urine.
 –Fy phase ...

131
00:15:41.120 --> 00:15:48.440
I've started doing it myself.
 What the hell, the damage is done!

132
00:15:48.600 --> 00:15:54.720
- Are you going into the water and kisses?
 - No, I'm standing on the edge.

133
00:15:54.880 --> 00:16:01.760
I can't relax when everyone looks.
 Last time I was standing there for 10 minutes.

134
00:16:01.920 --> 00:16:08.200
- But it ended?
 - Yes, then came the pure flood!

135
00:16:08.360 --> 00:16:13.600
It's the beer.
 It runs straight through one!

136
00:16:13.760 --> 00:16:17.600
No, I look like hell in this!

137
00:16:17.760 --> 00:16:23.080
No, you are very nice.
 But take a size smaller.

138
00:16:56.080 --> 00:17:01.920
Give me flowers, fast as hell!
 Give me a yellow variety!
 Iris, pimpinella ...!

139
00:17:02.080 --> 00:17:09.120
It's a cerise carnation!
 Are you blind, girlfriend?
 Give me gerbera!

140
00:17:10.200 --> 00:17:14.720
-What do they cost?
 –75 SEK.

141
00:17:14.880 --> 00:17:19.000
Give me gear!
 I'll have 25 bucks back.

142
00:17:19.160 --> 00:17:23.680
I thought you were robbed.

143
00:17:23.840 --> 00:17:26.880
You usually take things and go, only.

144
00:17:27.040 --> 00:17:30.440
If I were you I would just take them.

145
00:17:30.600 --> 00:17:35.960
–Out to pay?
 - You usually do so.

146
00:17:36.120 --> 00:17:42.840
- Oh, damn ... then I do.
 - Do not glue the hundred.

147
00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:46.400
Then I stick ...

148
00:17:46.560 --> 00:17:50.320
Nice weekend!

149
00:18:06.920 --> 00:18:14.200
Sayonara!
 Welcome to the basic course in karate.
 What is karate then?

150
00:18:14.360 --> 00:18:21.520
- You learn deadly blows.
 - You are partly right.

151
00:18:21.680 --> 00:18:27.480
But if you have come here to teach you, you have come wrong.

152
00:18:27.640 --> 00:18:32.520
For karate is about something completely different.

153
00:18:35.320 --> 00:18:39.360
Karate is all about ...

154
00:18:39.520 --> 00:18:42.320
...Control.

155
00:18:46.600 --> 00:18:53.600
We will start by learning the most important thing - not to hurt anyone.

156
00:18:53.760 --> 00:18:59.320
I need a volunteer.
 - If you come up ...

157
00:19:00.960 --> 00:19:05.560
You remember what I said about not hurting anyone?

158
00:19:05.720 --> 00:19:10.480
Within the karate, we mark the beat.

159
00:19:16.720 --> 00:19:21.200
There you see the difference between champions and beginners.

160
00:19:21.360 --> 00:19:27.720
Try to mark a blow to me.
 First we greet each other.

161
00:19:29.080 --> 00:19:32.720
Highlights ... We greet and mark.

162
00:19:43.760 --> 00:19:48.320
- The lesson is over today.
 - Isn't that more?

163
00:19:48.480 --> 00:19:53.320
- The clock is just ... - leave the room!

164
00:19:53.480 --> 00:19:58.520
- This was fucking fun.
 -Stick.

165
00:19:58.680 --> 00:20:01.680
See you on Thursday, then.

166
00:20:19.080 --> 00:20:23.880
-Hello!
 The situation?
 -Just great.
 How about you?

167
00:20:24.040 --> 00:20:30.840
- I and Johan were in Copenhagen.
 - Fun that it is good between you again!

168
00:20:31.000 --> 00:20:37.400
- What then "again"?
 - Sure it wasn't that good.

169
00:20:37.560 --> 00:20:43.360
If you are unfaithful, it is probably a sign that something is wrong.

170
00:20:43.520 --> 00:20:48.400
- I have not been unfaithful.
 - No, not you.

171
00:20:48.560 --> 00:20:54.840
Has Johan not said anything?
 It was over three weeks since I lay with him.

172
00:20:55.000 --> 00:20:58.280
- Have you been lying with my guy?
 -Yes.

173
00:20:58.440 --> 00:21:03.880
It was only once.
 He said it from the beginning.

174
00:21:04.040 --> 00:21:09.840
Yes, that he could not afford anymore.
 You apparently have a little scarce.

175
00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:13.640
Tell us if you need to borrow.

176
00:21:16.080 --> 00:21:21.480
Has it gotten better or worse during the week?

177
00:21:21.640 --> 00:21:26.040
It's the same I think.

178
00:21:26.200 --> 00:21:33.440
Here are the X -rays.
 Here you see the left ham and here are right.

179
00:21:33.600 --> 00:21:41.560
Squeezed between sits something that is probably the cause of the pain in the back.

180
00:21:41.720 --> 00:21:47.280
It's a Russian thesis you have here.

181
00:21:47.440 --> 00:21:55.840
You see the Samovar down here.
 Then you have six teacups in a row in colon.

182
00:21:56.000 --> 00:22:04.840
From the handles of the Samovar to judge, I guess it is from the 1880s.

183
00:22:05.000 --> 00:22:09.600
Probably made in Sankt Petersburg.

184
00:22:09.760 --> 00:22:13.840
What do you think it's worth today?

185
00:22:14.000 --> 00:22:18.720
- I don't know ... - guess.

186
00:22:18.880 --> 00:22:23.520
–5,000-6,000 SEK ...?
 -No absolutely not.

187
00:22:23.680 --> 00:22:29.880
I would say somewhere between SEK 18,000-20,000.

188
00:22:30.040 --> 00:22:33.640
-Are you surprised?
 -Yes.

189
00:22:33.800 --> 00:22:40.360
It's a rarity you're sitting on.
 It is rare to see them in such good condition.

190
00:22:52.360 --> 00:22:56.280
God, how nice to get away a bit!

191
00:22:56.440 --> 00:22:59.640
-When are you going?
 -Monday morning.

192
00:22:59.800 --> 00:23:04.000
Can you water the flowers, Kristina?

193
00:23:04.160 --> 00:23:08.880
- What happened now?
 - Kristina usually watering ...

194
00:23:09.040 --> 00:23:15.120
Why don't you ask me?
 "Kristina usually water ..."

195
00:23:15.280 --> 00:23:21.480
We know each other since play.
 Kristina is just with Magnus's friend.

196
00:23:21.640 --> 00:23:27.280
Why don't you ask me?
 - You are silent!

197
00:23:27.440 --> 00:23:34.280
- I don't know ... - It's no answer.
 Aren't I good enough?

198
00:23:34.440 --> 00:23:42.640
- I didn't think you wanted to ... - it's clear that I want to help you!

199
00:23:42.800 --> 00:23:45.800
Kristina ...!
 Thanks.

200
00:23:45.960 --> 00:23:51.760
Thank you, you!
 - Come, Kristina, we go!

201
00:23:51.920 --> 00:23:58.120
Ulf usually helps me with the computer, but Andreas works with network service ...

202
00:23:58.280 --> 00:24:02.840
- We are not desirable!
 --Ulf ...!

203
00:24:03.000 --> 00:24:07.400
Ulf: We don't set our foot here anymore.

204
00:24:07.560 --> 00:24:12.960
I usually put the water can on the sink.

205
00:24:17.080 --> 00:24:20.880
THE DOORBELL RINGS

206
00:24:17.080 --> 00:24:20.880
Do you open?

207
00:24:21.040 --> 00:24:27.360
Hello!
 I would need your help.
 This applies to Fridas and Magnus flowers.

208
00:24:27.520 --> 00:24:34.040
They are so many!
 I really can't water them.
 Can you do it?

209
00:24:34.200 --> 00:24:37.200
Jenny does not want to water with Frida.

210
00:24:37.360 --> 00:24:42.440
When it gets hot you are not so cocky anymore.

211
00:24:42.600 --> 00:24:48.760
- Is the old Bettan that is shredded?
 - I can't cook such old computers.

212
00:24:48.920 --> 00:24:54.080
- Gee her to me, just.
 - I can water.

213
00:24:54.240 --> 00:24:58.480
Don't say anything to Magnus and Frida, please?

214
00:24:58.640 --> 00:25:03.040
Should we do the job and you get the honor?

215
00:25:03.200 --> 00:25:09.480
Next time we play TP we will go.
 Is it okey?

216
00:25:09.640 --> 00:25:15.880
-It is okay.
 - Nice that we can trust you.
 Bye!

217
00:25:18.040 --> 00:25:22.840
- Can they trust us?
 -Do not think so.

218
00:25:28.800 --> 00:25:33.040
Oh no!
 They are dead!

219
00:25:33.200 --> 00:25:38.360
- Jenny has killed every flower!
 - This is not good!

220
00:25:38.520 --> 00:25:44.960
I have received viruses.
 I would never have let Andreas pill with the computer!

221
00:25:45.120 --> 00:25:51.120
- What are we saying to Jenny and Andreas?
 - What are we saying to Ulf and Kristina?

222
00:25:51.280 --> 00:25:56.320
Those who always want to help.
 I feel really good!

223
00:25:56.480 --> 00:26:02.600
Next time we play TP we let Ulf and Kristina win!

224
00:26:02.760 --> 00:26:08.840
- They are useless at TP.
 - Desto happier they will be!

225
00:26:10.120 --> 00:26:16.680
"Which English teddy bear likes honey and is a friend of Nasse?"

226
00:26:16.840 --> 00:26:22.880
-Mr. Nilsson?
 - It's a monkey!
 Nalle Puh is right.

227
00:26:23.040 --> 00:26:28.800
Then we, Kristina.
 YES!
 Last Pluppen!

228
00:26:28.960 --> 00:26:33.720
- "Which king died in Lützen?"
 - Gustav III!

229
00:26:33.880 --> 00:26:38.040
-It is right.
 - Wasn't it Karl XII?

230
00:26:38.200 --> 00:26:41.080
That's also right.

231
00:26:52.680 --> 00:26:56.680
Program text: Helena Habermann (C) Swedish Television AB 2004

232
00:27:12.360 --> 00:27:16.200
How is it going?

233
00:27:17.480 --> 00:27:20.480
I look like a man in this.
