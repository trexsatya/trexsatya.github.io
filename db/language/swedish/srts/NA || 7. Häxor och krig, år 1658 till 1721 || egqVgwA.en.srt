1
00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:27.760
The war is over and the Swedish army is retreat from Norway over the mountains.

2
00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:57.520
Sweden has lost, and the road here has been long and difficult.

3
00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:07.360
As the Great Power Time is heading to its end-

4
00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:13.160
- Sweden goes through some of the most difficult times the country has been involved.

5
00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:17.040
Witch burns, misgrowth and plague ...

6
00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:21.200
All wars transform Sweden into a military state -

7
00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:28.640
- And thousands of young men will die in the attempts to preserve the superpower.

8
00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:37.440
This is the story of our country.

9
00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:41.800
About the people and forces that have shaped it -

10
00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:46.720
- Endure from the ice age until our days.

11
00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:04.600
This is the story of Sweden.

12
00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:19.520
Swedish Empire in 1658.

13
00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:25.400
Years of successful wars have given Sweden areas both in the east and south.

14
00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:28.560
Many pay tribute to the Swedish warriors.

15
00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:34.560
Poets describe the Swedes as a people chosen by God -

16
00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:41.000
- And scientist Olof Rudbeck writes that the country can be Atlantis.

17
00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:53.560
But that the Swedish kingdom has become so great is a small comfort for ordinary people.

18
00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:05.640
You have a hard time in Sweden.
 Harvests fail and people starve.

19
00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:10.720
It is a misery that must have an explanation - and a scapegoat.

20
00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:17.280
The time of witch processes is here.

21
00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:22.640
Stories about sorcery and witchcraft are starting to spread.

22
00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:27.840
Swedish soldiers who return home have such stories with them.

23
00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:33.520
On the continent, they become witnesses to bonfires and witchcraft processes.

24
00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:41.200
/Church bells squeeze/

25
00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:52.400
When the stories of witches are given, they spread like wildfire across the country.

26
00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:58.960
Neighbors and family members begin to accuse each other for sorcery.

27
00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:05.760
Here in Torsåker in Ångermanland, it is the priest who holds the clock.

28
00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:15.320
In Sweden, priests had long accused people of doing magic -

29
00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:20.480
- When they read rams about wounds and other things that the church thought was pagan.

30
00:04:20.640 --> 00:04:24.920
But the allegations of witchcraft were something completely different.

31
00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:30.680
It was children who accused, and they said they were abducted at night.

32
00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:35.440
The children tell imaginative stories -

33
00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:39.680
- In how the witches take them to Blåkulla at night.

34
00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:46.120
That they had to write their names with blood in the devil's book during crazy parties.

35
00:04:47.200 --> 00:04:52.160
The children said the women danced with the devil, had sex with him -

36
00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:55.480
- And gave birth to children they boiled in tickles.

37
00:04:55.640 --> 00:05:02.440
In the interrogation protocols, it is obvious that the children have been inspired by each other.

38
00:05:02.600 --> 00:05:07.600
From the beginning, the governing bodies could accept a number of executions -

39
00:05:07.760 --> 00:05:13.560
- To calm down the situation, but the result was exactly the opposite.

40
00:05:13.720 --> 00:05:19.920
A mass hysteria with accusations and trunk burns spreads in the country.

41
00:05:24.760 --> 00:05:28.880
One of the drivers behind the witch process in Torsåker-

42
00:05:29.040 --> 00:05:32.160
- Is the priest Laurentius Hornaeus.

43
00:05:32.320 --> 00:05:38.240
His mother had been executed for sorcery without trying to save her.

44
00:05:38.400 --> 00:05:41.400
Hornaeus had the help of two spanks:

45
00:05:41.560 --> 00:05:46.280
Two orphans who said they could show which were witches -

46
00:05:46.440 --> 00:05:51.440
- By seeing a mark in the forehead of those who were in covenants with the devil.

47
00:05:51.600 --> 00:05:58.520
Therefore, they got paid to stand on the church hill and point out witches.

48
00:05:58.680 --> 00:06:00.680
Witch!

49
00:06:07.880 --> 00:06:13.920
It was extremely difficult.
 If the women went to the church, they could be designated.

50
00:06:14.080 --> 00:06:18.880
And if they stayed at home, it could be a sign that they were witches.

51
00:06:19.040 --> 00:06:23.480
On one occasion, one of the boys pointed out the priest's wife -

52
00:06:23.640 --> 00:06:26.800
- But then he got a proper ear file.

53
00:06:26.960 --> 00:06:31.520
Then he said he saw wrong because he had the sun in his eyes.

54
00:06:37.480 --> 00:06:43.280
The accused are interrogated.
 You want to know which others have been involved.

55
00:06:43.440 --> 00:06:47.400
Soon more and more women are being identified.

56
00:06:47.560 --> 00:06:53.120
On October 15, 1674, a trial begins.

57
00:06:57.520 --> 00:07:02.520
The women here are believed to have been locked up all winter while waiting for execution.

58
00:07:02.680 --> 00:07:05.840
It must have been very scary.

59
00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:11.240
Accusations, interrogations, death sentences and certainly nightmares as well.

60
00:07:11.400 --> 00:07:15.240
In the end, maybe they began to doubt themselves.

61
00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:29.360
About seventy people are charged, and almost all are women.

62
00:07:29.520 --> 00:07:34.800
Every fifth woman living here is identified as a witch.

63
00:07:37.760 --> 00:07:43.160
And it's not just where people are accused.
 The death sentences become so many -

64
00:07:43.320 --> 00:07:48.320
–The authorities try to stop them with special sorcery commissions -

65
00:07:48.480 --> 00:07:52.480
- which must try the judges before anyone can be executed.

66
00:07:52.640 --> 00:07:58.160
In Torsåker, many people probably believed that the Commission would mitigate the judges.

67
00:07:58.320 --> 00:08:03.320
And some government officials thought the witch processes went too far.

68
00:08:03.480 --> 00:08:08.480
You do not know why, but the Commission did not mitigate the judges in Torsåker.

69
00:08:08.640 --> 00:08:14.040
After months of interrogation and waiting, it is decided to execute the sentence.

70
00:08:14.200 --> 00:08:16.960
The convicted people should be killed.

71
00:08:17.120 --> 00:08:23.400
On the execution day, they are given communion - and then understand what will happen.

72
00:08:45.760 --> 00:08:50.880
In total, some seventy people are executed this night.

73
00:08:51.040 --> 00:08:54.720
And the bodies are then burned on a bonfire.

74
00:09:10.640 --> 00:09:15.440
These terrible witch processes that occur in many parts of the country -

75
00:09:15.600 --> 00:09:20.600
-In the end of the 17th century, was called "the great noise".

76
00:09:20.760 --> 00:09:24.760
In Stockholm, several people are convicted of sorcery -

77
00:09:24.920 --> 00:09:28.320
- Here at Stigberget on Södermalm.

78
00:09:29.680 --> 00:09:34.960
But now ever higher protests are starting to be heard.
 How many are to die?

79
00:09:35.120 --> 00:09:41.720
The authorities may have enough and more are starting to suspect that the children are inventing.

80
00:09:47.360 --> 00:09:51.960
Suddenly one of the children who testifies together during a hearing breaks.

81
00:09:52.120 --> 00:09:57.400
And this girl can tell you that the children's stories are pure lies.

82
00:09:57.560 --> 00:10:02.560
They have driven each other with their fantasies.
 And so the hot hunt is over.

83
00:10:02.720 --> 00:10:07.080
The authorities call the witch charges for mass hysteria.

84
00:10:09.400 --> 00:10:14.600
In the country's churches, the priests must now stand in the pulpit and tell -

85
00:10:14.760 --> 00:10:21.320
- The witch processes have been a mistake, that the devil has deceived us all.

86
00:10:21.480 --> 00:10:26.640
In the Torsåker district it is said that people afterwards went detours -

87
00:10:26.800 --> 00:10:30.160
- To avoid walking past the parsonage.

88
00:10:32.160 --> 00:10:36.960
The two speeches in Torsåker are found to be killed.

89
00:10:38.680 --> 00:10:44.120
No one cares to investigate who is guilty of their death.

90
00:11:02.400 --> 00:11:08.240
At this time, a new king sits on the Swedish throne - Karl XI.

91
00:11:08.400 --> 00:11:14.840
He has become of legal age and will control the superpower that he inherited from his father.

92
00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:18.320
Many people underestimate the young Karl XI.

93
00:11:18.480 --> 00:11:22.640
He is probably dyslexics and his studies are slow.

94
00:11:22.800 --> 00:11:28.000
Many people believe that the king is uneducated and doubts that he has what is required -

95
00:11:28.160 --> 00:11:31.680
- To solve the problems Sweden is facing.

96
00:11:31.840 --> 00:11:36.240
Sweden has been ruled by a guardian government.
 There is a crisis in the Treasury.

97
00:11:36.400 --> 00:11:41.000
And in Denmark Kristian V is waiting for an opportunity to attack Sweden -

98
00:11:41.160 --> 00:11:44.160
- And take back Skåne, Blekinge and Halland.

99
00:11:44.320 --> 00:11:49.000
And when he notices that Sweden's situation is bad, he sees his chance.

100
00:11:49.160 --> 00:11:52.160
Now the war comes to Swedish soil.

101
00:11:52.320 --> 00:11:57.120
Denmark attacks Sweden from several directions.

102
00:12:01.280 --> 00:12:06.520
The uncertainty that Karl XI has shown in the lesson room is as blown away -

103
00:12:06.680 --> 00:12:10.440
- When he is going up in the saddle on his horse.

104
00:12:12.680 --> 00:12:16.720
He will show his ability in the war that now breaks out -

105
00:12:16.880 --> 00:12:21.280
- When Denmark is trying to take back Skåne.

106
00:12:23.160 --> 00:12:28.040
At first, things are not going well.
 Once the war has been going on for a year-

107
00:12:28.200 --> 00:12:33.800
- If the Danes have taken up almost all of Skåne.
 The Swedish army is weakened.

108
00:12:33.960 --> 00:12:37.000
One -third of the soldiers have died -

109
00:12:37.160 --> 00:12:42.760
- Or they have become ill in the cold and infected tent camps.

110
00:12:43.760 --> 00:12:48.200
When winter comes, the Swedish army is close to Lund -

111
00:12:48.360 --> 00:12:52.080
- Where the Danish army has camped.

112
00:12:52.240 --> 00:12:58.280
The Swedes stand on one side of Kävlingeån, the Danes on the other.

113
00:12:58.440 --> 00:13:03.880
The Swedes decide to surprise the Danes -

114
00:13:04.040 --> 00:13:08.560
–Com by moving very early in the morning -

115
00:13:08.720 --> 00:13:14.840
- The day after the Danes have had a wet party in the camp.

116
00:13:17.280 --> 00:13:21.880
With a surprise attack, Karl XI intends to invest everything on a card -

117
00:13:22.040 --> 00:13:27.680
- In one last desperate maneuver to break a long series of Danish victories.

118
00:13:27.840 --> 00:13:30.040
The Swedes are at a sub-

119
00:13:30.200 --> 00:13:35.680
“But the soldiers are trained to fight in a way that turns out effectively.

120
00:13:35.840 --> 00:13:40.800
The Swedish combat technology is based on, one could almost say -

121
00:13:40.960 --> 00:13:46.480
- You surprise the opponent and go to brutal attack.

122
00:13:54.160 --> 00:13:59.720
The Swedish soldiers take turns to fire their muskets against the enemy -

123
00:13:59.880 --> 00:14:02.880
- At the same time as they advance.

124
00:14:03.040 --> 00:14:06.920
And the cavalry attacks in groups, they ride closely together -

125
00:14:07.080 --> 00:14:11.960
- With the enemy lines, without stopping to shoot.

126
00:14:14.760 --> 00:14:18.120
The Swedes do not have much choice.

127
00:14:18.280 --> 00:14:23.360
If you want to win this kind, an aggressive behavior is required.

128
00:14:23.520 --> 00:14:28.240
As quickly as possible, you get into close range.

129
00:14:28.400 --> 00:14:33.600
The moment is in for Karl XI's chance.
 With their 8,000 men-

130
00:14:33.760 --> 00:14:38.760
- He try to surprise the Danish army that is 5,000 people stronger.

131
00:14:38.920 --> 00:14:45.080
Before the attack, he writes to his mother, the widow queen Hedvig Eleonora:

132
00:14:45.240 --> 00:14:48.480
"We shall fight or die."

133
00:14:52.920 --> 00:14:57.560
At half past three in the morning of December 4, 1676-

134
00:14:57.720 --> 00:15:02.840
- Is the ice on Kävlingeån thick enough to carry an entire army.

135
00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:06.800
It is the introduction to the Battle of Lund.

136
00:15:10.360 --> 00:15:14.520
The two forces collapse at half past nine.

137
00:15:14.680 --> 00:15:18.680
There was a basic plan for how to arrange the troops:

138
00:15:18.840 --> 00:15:22.240
The infantry in the middle and cavalry on the wings.

139
00:15:22.400 --> 00:15:27.040
But once the battle starts, an organized chaos arises.

140
00:15:43.880 --> 00:15:48.880
It is black gun smoke, projectiles and horses that swirl up dust -

141
00:15:49.040 --> 00:15:53.440
- So an individual soldier perceives very little of what is happening.

142
00:15:53.600 --> 00:15:58.080
He looks a few meters.
 It is tunnel vision at best.

143
00:16:01.960 --> 00:16:07.080
A large part of the soldiers will not be able to work on the battlefield at all.

144
00:16:07.240 --> 00:16:11.520
They will be paralyzed by horror.

145
00:16:11.680 --> 00:16:15.680
Soldiers and people are injured around.

146
00:16:15.840 --> 00:16:21.560
It must be an extreme fear.
 You have to feel huge adrenaline rush.

147
00:16:30.360 --> 00:16:36.920
They come from the same parishes, it can be childhood mates and relatives.

148
00:16:37.080 --> 00:16:43.280
One does not fight primarily for the national feeling, the king or the commanders-

149
00:16:43.440 --> 00:16:47.440
- You are fighting for the closest comrades.

150
00:16:50.280 --> 00:16:53.280
The fighting waves back and forth.

151
00:16:53.440 --> 00:16:57.440
But when the Swedish Army attacks the Danes from two directions -

152
00:16:57.600 --> 00:17:02.600
- With Karl XI at the head of the cavalry, the Danes flee.

153
00:17:04.920 --> 00:17:09.600
At five o'clock in the afternoon, Karl XI gives orders for ceasefire.

154
00:17:09.760 --> 00:17:16.000
The Swedes win in the bloodiest battle on Swedish soil ever.

155
00:17:16.160 --> 00:17:20.520
About 9,000 men die, of which 6,000 are Danes -

156
00:17:20.680 --> 00:17:24.320
- Double as many as the Swedish losses.

157
00:17:24.480 --> 00:17:30.760
The battle becomes a turning point in the war, and three years later the war is over.

158
00:17:37.400 --> 00:17:41.560
Karl XI has proven himself on the battlefield.

159
00:17:41.720 --> 00:17:46.720
Sweden may keep Skåne, but it is in ash and ruins.

160
00:17:48.240 --> 00:17:53.920
After the Scanian war, the Swedish Treasury is in lousy condition.

161
00:17:54.080 --> 00:17:59.520
The war has cost both in crew and in money resources -

162
00:17:59.680 --> 00:18:02.920
–And you need new income.

163
00:18:06.960 --> 00:18:11.960
Instead of tax increases, which was the usual road -

164
00:18:12.120 --> 00:18:18.040
- Getting funds for the Treasury, so you made another choice.

165
00:18:18.200 --> 00:18:23.360
You reduced the nobility's goods, you pulled in goods to the crown.

166
00:18:28.640 --> 00:18:33.000
Some nobles got rid of a lot.

167
00:18:33.160 --> 00:18:36.160
After all, they were not poor -

168
00:18:36.320 --> 00:18:41.080
- But they had lost several of their significant goods.

169
00:18:42.520 --> 00:18:47.760
This action goes to history as "the great reduction".

170
00:18:47.920 --> 00:18:50.920
In the same vein, Karl XI makes a singleness.

171
00:18:51.080 --> 00:18:57.760
Like the Danish and French king, he would have unrestricted power.

172
00:19:00.680 --> 00:19:06.680
The peasants want to limit the power of the nobility and support the decision on a single king.

173
00:19:06.840 --> 00:19:11.960
Both statutory and executive power are now placed in the king's hands.

174
00:19:12.120 --> 00:19:16.480
The king plays skillfully here, as young he is.

175
00:19:16.640 --> 00:19:20.400
Karl XI manages to maneuver the groups towards each other -

176
00:19:20.560 --> 00:19:23.360
- and make themselves a single.

177
00:19:23.520 --> 00:19:26.760
When now the king was liable only before God-

178
00:19:26.920 --> 00:19:31.360
- It was almost impossible for the nobility to oppose.

179
00:19:31.520 --> 00:19:35.400
Karl XI can now control the kingdom entirely himself.

180
00:19:35.560 --> 00:19:40.520
The young king can initiate war, enact laws and introduce taxes -

181
00:19:40.680 --> 00:19:43.560
- Created as he wants.

182
00:19:50.160 --> 00:19:52.560
Karl XI has a plan.

183
00:19:52.720 --> 00:19:57.880
He will build a defense that can protect the Swedish superpower.

184
00:20:02.240 --> 00:20:06.840
So he builds the armed forces deep in Swedish society.

185
00:20:07.000 --> 00:20:11.760
In the countryside, women who get married can become soldier wives.

186
00:20:11.920 --> 00:20:17.320
In the Swedish villages there must be professional soldiers who are ready for war.

187
00:20:17.480 --> 00:20:20.720
A standing army.

188
00:20:36.800 --> 00:20:40.160
The peasants should themselves obtain suitable soldiers -

189
00:20:40.320 --> 00:20:45.120
- As they give a torpedo with land to grow on, in peacetime.

190
00:20:45.280 --> 00:20:50.680
And the soldiers get names like lance, shooter and fast.

191
00:21:02.920 --> 00:21:07.880
Over time, Karl XI's soldiers will be called Carolines.

192
00:21:08.040 --> 00:21:12.280
It is now that the Carolines get their uniform uniform:

193
00:21:12.440 --> 00:21:16.800
The blue famous uniform with the half -length jacket.

194
00:21:24.000 --> 00:21:28.120
55,000 are manufactured across the country.

195
00:21:28.280 --> 00:21:33.080
The whole of Sweden is started and becomes an effective military state.

196
00:21:33.240 --> 00:21:37.840
Except that all soldiers get a soil -clogging after their rank-

197
00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:43.680
- So you also get a house.
 Soldiers get torp, and then in rising order-

198
00:21:43.840 --> 00:21:48.840
- From sub -officers to officers and colonel, you get a residence -

199
00:21:49.000 --> 00:21:53.240
- As a military position corresponds to.

200
00:22:04.400 --> 00:22:08.400
The church is the state's propaganda machine.

201
00:22:08.560 --> 00:22:15.120
At the worship services, the people are informed of the success of the country and the king.

202
00:22:17.400 --> 00:22:22.960
The pulpits are also used to read laws and regulations.

203
00:22:24.680 --> 00:22:30.480
But everyone does not fit into Karl XI's new order for Sweden.

204
00:22:30.640 --> 00:22:34.080
Some who happen to be bad are the Sami.

205
00:22:34.240 --> 00:22:40.240
In the 17th century came the loose driver law, as protection against loose driver and begging.

206
00:22:40.400 --> 00:22:43.400
People were not allowed to run loose.

207
00:22:43.560 --> 00:22:49.160
Sami became one of the groups that went under the loose driver.

208
00:22:49.320 --> 00:22:55.240
At this time, Sami lives not only in the north, but down to Mälardalen.

209
00:22:55.400 --> 00:22:59.600
Some lived in cities, some were farmers or fishermen-

210
00:22:59.760 --> 00:23:02.760
- While others lived like nomads.

211
00:23:02.920 --> 00:23:08.840
Since the nomads had no fixed address, they were difficult to tax.

212
00:23:12.000 --> 00:23:17.800
You do not want population outside the patchwork lands, which cannot be taxed.

213
00:23:17.960 --> 00:23:24.240
Thus, you force, or try to force, Sami to move to the north.

214
00:23:25.440 --> 00:23:29.840
The state, Kronan, wanted the Sami out in the mountain world -

215
00:23:30.000 --> 00:23:34.920
-For they were at home with their reindeer, so it gave the work return -

216
00:23:35.080 --> 00:23:38.480
- In the form of tax that the crown took in.

217
00:23:38.640 --> 00:23:44.360
So the Sami began to tame the wilds instead, and have them closer.

218
00:23:46.440 --> 00:23:50.600
The view of the Sami is partly changed in the 17th century.

219
00:23:50.760 --> 00:23:54.440
They begin to be considered an exciting, exotic element -

220
00:23:54.600 --> 00:23:59.520
- And you are interested in the Sami high -quality crafts and products.

221
00:23:59.680 --> 00:24:02.480
A "we and judgment" perspective is created.

222
00:24:02.640 --> 00:24:08.000
The view of the patchwork is different.
 The area is seen as a large colony-

223
00:24:08.160 --> 00:24:12.760
-for example.
 as India or Africa, with resources to exploit.

224
00:24:12.920 --> 00:24:17.600
You go there to see the exclusive, exotic, unexpected -

225
00:24:17.760 --> 00:24:22.920
- And to buy and may sometimes steal Sami objects, Sami craft.

226
00:24:23.080 --> 00:24:27.160
You could say that it is the basis for politics that comes.

227
00:24:27.320 --> 00:24:31.320
"Patch should be a patch" is very clear during the 20th century.

228
00:24:38.720 --> 00:24:42.280
The end of the 17th century are difficult times.

229
00:24:42.440 --> 00:24:46.560
At the same time as “the flower time” begins to be sung in the country-

230
00:24:46.720 --> 00:24:50.840
- Sweden's Sweden is affected and starvation.

231
00:25:03.800 --> 00:25:08.880
These years of the 1690s are terrible disaster years.

232
00:25:09.040 --> 00:25:13.600
It is among the worst times to live in Sweden ever.

233
00:25:13.760 --> 00:25:18.720
Harvests fail several years in a row because the weather is very strange.

234
00:25:18.880 --> 00:25:23.720
This is during the Little Ice Age, with a generally cooler climate than today.

235
00:25:23.880 --> 00:25:28.040
In addition, the seasons seem to be out of play.

236
00:25:28.200 --> 00:25:32.200
It is hot in winter, the grass grows in February.

237
00:25:32.360 --> 00:25:36.480
And in the summer it rains and is frost.

238
00:25:36.640 --> 00:25:41.640
The crops do not grow and it causes people to starve to death, simply.

239
00:25:46.400 --> 00:25:51.240
The famine and weather phenomena were seen by some as evil ome-

240
00:25:51.400 --> 00:25:55.280
- Conditions about a future disaster.

241
00:25:55.440 --> 00:26:00.040
And at the castle, Karl XI is severely ill and weak.

242
00:26:00.200 --> 00:26:05.200
His body is eaten by a cancerous tumor that grows in his stomach.

243
00:26:05.360 --> 00:26:11.040
That the king is struck in this situation, while the famine advises -

244
00:26:11.200 --> 00:26:16.200
- It is interpreted as now wanting God to punish Sweden for real.

245
00:26:17.520 --> 00:26:23.040
The king dies in April 1697, but the accidents do not end there.

246
00:26:23.200 --> 00:26:29.160
Just a month later, a fire spreads at the castle Three Kronor.

247
00:26:29.320 --> 00:26:32.560
And the castle burns down.

248
00:26:40.600 --> 00:26:44.800
When Karl XI dies, his son inherits the crown.

249
00:26:45.960 --> 00:26:50.000
Karl XII now becomes the king of Sweden.

250
00:26:55.120 --> 00:26:58.680
He is crowned 15 years old and calls himself Carolus.

251
00:26:58.840 --> 00:27:03.400
For him, it is a matter of course to be a single.

252
00:27:05.640 --> 00:27:11.560
It is a difficult challenge for Karl XII to control its large areas.

253
00:27:11.720 --> 00:27:14.720
He is untested and very young -

254
00:27:14.880 --> 00:27:20.200
- And Sweden's enemies see their chance to regain territories they lost.

255
00:27:20.360 --> 00:27:26.680
After a series of attacks in 1700, Sweden ends up in war with three enemies.

256
00:27:26.840 --> 00:27:31.960
The king has no choice.
 He must defend the Swedish territories.

257
00:27:32.120 --> 00:27:36.400
And this is the beginning of the Great Nordic War.

258
00:27:37.680 --> 00:27:42.080
Karl XII is only 17 years old when the war breaks out.

259
00:27:42.240 --> 00:27:46.760
The sources tell about a man who is both eager and nervous.

260
00:27:46.920 --> 00:27:51.480
He sees it as his sacred duty to defend the kingdom he inherited.

261
00:27:55.400 --> 00:27:59.480
Karl XII is now in motion all the military defense machine -

262
00:27:59.640 --> 00:28:02.760
- As his father built up.

263
00:28:02.920 --> 00:28:05.720
Soldiers are called in.

264
00:28:09.400 --> 00:28:14.000
At the estate Salshult in Småland, rider champion Jon Stålhammar - has

265
00:28:14.160 --> 00:28:17.840
- The wife Sofia Drake and the couple's four children.

266
00:28:18.000 --> 00:28:23.800
Sofia writes in her calendar: "Anno 1700 on June 7" -

267
00:28:23.960 --> 00:28:28.800
- "My dear husband traveled away from me to Skåne, as well as the whole army."

268
00:28:28.960 --> 00:28:31.880
"God give them all his blessing" -

269
00:28:32.040 --> 00:28:38.120
- "And soon let them with health, peace and joy come home to us again."

270
00:28:48.240 --> 00:28:53.400
The farewell is many and the uncertainty is great.

271
00:28:55.120 --> 00:28:58.520
Do they ever come back?

272
00:29:04.880 --> 00:29:10.360
During the 17th century war, eight of ten called died in war service.

273
00:29:10.520 --> 00:29:13.160
Everyone was aware of.

274
00:29:13.320 --> 00:29:18.320
It was very alive in the popular memory how dangerous it was to be a soldier.

275
00:29:45.320 --> 00:29:48.400
Karl XII directs his power south.

276
00:29:48.560 --> 00:29:51.960
The Carolines march to Skåne and Denmark.

277
00:29:52.120 --> 00:29:55.800
With the help of allies, Sweden presses the Danish King -

278
00:29:55.960 --> 00:30:00.560
- To withdraw their troops and cancel the war.

279
00:30:00.720 --> 00:30:06.680
Then Karl XII looks at Russia which besieged the Swedish city of Narva.

280
00:30:06.840 --> 00:30:10.840
He ships his army to the Baltic.

281
00:30:11.000 --> 00:30:14.720
But in Narva it looks very dark.

282
00:30:14.880 --> 00:30:20.840
The Swedish army stands against almost four times as many Russian soldiers.

283
00:30:26.560 --> 00:30:32.040
In Sweden, many want to know how things are going for friends and relatives in the army.

284
00:30:35.880 --> 00:30:41.720
So you gather in the churches, where news about the war is spread.

285
00:30:41.880 --> 00:30:46.880
When the war is successful, you celebrate thanksgiving days in all churches.

286
00:30:47.040 --> 00:30:51.240
Everyone learns how good the soldiers and the king have been.

287
00:30:51.400 --> 00:30:54.960
But when things go bad, then it is quiet.

288
00:31:01.240 --> 00:31:06.720
While the women are waiting for a message about their spouses, they have a great responsibility -

289
00:31:06.880 --> 00:31:12.720
- Take care of the yard, the animals and the children.
 A very tiring job.

290
00:31:12.880 --> 00:31:16.880
But they are also awaiting concern for the message for another reason:

291
00:31:17.040 --> 00:31:21.600
If the husband dies in battle, the woman must leave her torp-

292
00:31:21.760 --> 00:31:27.160
- If within a year she will not find herself a new man who can become a soldier.

293
00:31:27.320 --> 00:31:32.160
If that does not happen, she must leave from home and farm with her children.

294
00:31:40.680 --> 00:31:44.360
After a long silence of the king ...

295
00:31:44.520 --> 00:31:49.080
/Church bells and cannon salute/

296
00:31:49.240 --> 00:31:51.840
... reaches the news Stockholm.

297
00:31:52.000 --> 00:31:56.600
10,000 Carolines have defeated a four times as much Russian strength -

298
00:31:56.760 --> 00:31:59.480
- At Narva in the Baltic States.

299
00:31:59.640 --> 00:32:06.040
The Swedish people are encouraged to celebrate the victory - and they are happy to do so.

300
00:32:09.920 --> 00:32:15.520
The stories of Narva emphasize that Karl XII bravely rode in the first line -

301
00:32:15.680 --> 00:32:20.680
- Something that was unusual at this time.
 Now the image of Karl XII - is created

302
00:32:20.840 --> 00:32:27.600
- As the great warrior king, and then he is depicted several hundred years later.

303
00:32:27.760 --> 00:32:32.160
After the Battle of Narva, the Russian Army is temporarily eliminated -

304
00:32:32.320 --> 00:32:35.120
- But other enemies remain.

305
00:32:35.280 --> 00:32:40.480
So Karl XII directs his army towards present -day Poland and northern Germany.

306
00:32:49.560 --> 00:32:55.160
When the king is out in the field, the Swedish kingdom is governed by the Royal Council.

307
00:32:55.320 --> 00:33:01.160
Since the castle Three Kronor burned down, the council sits in the Wrangelska palace.

308
00:33:01.320 --> 00:33:06.400
But it is still Karl XII who decides.
 He controls the kingdom with letter-

309
00:33:06.560 --> 00:33:11.640
- As he sends from the campaign, and the council does as the king says.

310
00:33:11.800 --> 00:33:16.280
The letters may take months to arrive.
 It says that the king wants -

311
00:33:16.440 --> 00:33:21.240
- The advice will withdraw more money and send more soldiers.

312
00:33:21.400 --> 00:33:24.800
Karl XII does not come home to Sweden for many years.

313
00:33:24.960 --> 00:33:29.440
He remains down on the continent in an extended war.

314
00:33:29.600 --> 00:33:33.600
The motive behind almost all of the Karl XII did -

315
00:33:33.760 --> 00:33:39.120
- Where to preserve the kingdom that his father had built up.

316
00:33:39.280 --> 00:33:43.280
I think, because no one knows for sure.

317
00:33:45.520 --> 00:33:49.520
The result, which no one could know from the beginning-

318
00:33:49.680 --> 00:33:52.640
- Boyed a big failure.

319
00:33:52.800 --> 00:33:58.560
A war company that depleted the country on resources -

320
00:33:58.720 --> 00:34:02.200
- Especially money and mankraft.

321
00:34:04.640 --> 00:34:10.320
Stålhammar hopes during the first years of the war on a near peace.

322
00:34:12.280 --> 00:34:18.720
In 1703 he writes to Sofia from Riga that if he only saw her again -

323
00:34:18.880 --> 00:34:22.200
- he never would go away again.

324
00:34:22.360 --> 00:34:25.360
He gives her advice on how to manage the farm.

325
00:34:25.520 --> 00:34:29.600
It should be cleared and walled in the Great Hall.

326
00:34:29.760 --> 00:34:36.280
Unlike others, Sofia gets a better economy when her husband has become a major.

327
00:34:36.440 --> 00:34:41.680
She invests when the krona sells farms to finance the war.

328
00:34:41.840 --> 00:34:48.480
And Stålhammar sends home war changes such as furs, fabrics and valuables.

329
00:34:54.160 --> 00:35:00.000
For several years, Karl XII is fighting in present -day Poland and northern Germany.

330
00:35:00.160 --> 00:35:05.640
The army is dependent on the local community and lives on what the area has to provide.

331
00:35:05.800 --> 00:35:11.080
This is one of the reasons why you prefer to fight abroad.

332
00:35:11.240 --> 00:35:16.960
Mostly they were in march and in camps and tried to survive.

333
00:35:17.120 --> 00:35:19.960
It was the soldier's everyday life.

334
00:35:20.120 --> 00:35:26.320
Battle were only explosive small elements that lasted a day at most.

335
00:35:30.120 --> 00:35:37.000
The greatest risk of dying was not in the battle field, but it was of illness.

336
00:35:37.160 --> 00:35:42.440
Most often it is dysentery that has to do with food, or it is typhoid.

337
00:35:42.600 --> 00:35:47.600
And this is spread in the camps, where you live close to each other.

338
00:35:50.320 --> 00:35:54.360
The soldiers, military leadership and officers -

339
00:35:54.520 --> 00:35:58.480
- They were not alone in an army.

340
00:35:58.640 --> 00:36:03.760
Here was the belief, which was an obvious part.

341
00:36:08.320 --> 00:36:15.200
It consisted of various craftsmen needed for the maintenance of the army:

342
00:36:15.360 --> 00:36:20.720
Wagons with food and horses that drew all this.

343
00:36:20.880 --> 00:36:24.160
And in addition a civilian companion-

344
00:36:24.320 --> 00:36:28.720
- Women and children and share the locals -

345
00:36:28.880 --> 00:36:33.080
- From the resorts that the army passed.

346
00:36:33.240 --> 00:36:38.360
Several women are active in the Market Center -

347
00:36:38.520 --> 00:36:46.080
- Where you sell tobacco, spirits, some food and stuff to the soldiers.

348
00:36:58.680 --> 00:37:03.360
Karl XII considered it problematic with women in the field, especially if they were -

349
00:37:03.520 --> 00:37:08.720
- Of lower rank.
 They were unsatisfied, he thought, and the slow -down pace.

350
00:37:08.880 --> 00:37:13.920
Karl XII wants as little as possible to do with civilists -

351
00:37:14.080 --> 00:37:18.840
- And others who can interfere with military and military purposes.

352
00:37:19.000 --> 00:37:24.640
In different ways the king tried to reduce the need -

353
00:37:24.800 --> 00:37:29.160
- Of civilian assistants, especially women.

354
00:37:29.320 --> 00:37:36.400
Women for the care of the sick were needed, and marketing shoes were needed.

355
00:37:36.560 --> 00:37:39.400
But others were not welcome.

356
00:37:47.440 --> 00:37:52.320
Karl XII introduced restrictions on marriage in the field -

357
00:37:52.480 --> 00:37:55.880
- Prompt all marriage in enemy country.

358
00:37:56.040 --> 00:38:01.040
But these rules were still not carved in stone.

359
00:38:01.200 --> 00:38:07.560
It appeared that soldiers met someone in the locals -

360
00:38:07.720 --> 00:38:11.600
- As the soldier wanted to marry.

361
00:38:20.040 --> 00:38:26.680
After all, women were important for some functions in the army.

362
00:38:26.840 --> 00:38:32.440
So it happened that the military leadership approved marriage -

363
00:38:32.600 --> 00:38:36.880
- The restrictive attitude of the king.

364
00:38:53.520 --> 00:38:57.760
In August 1708, the Nordic War has been going on for eight years -

365
00:38:57.920 --> 00:39:03.320
-And Karl XII leaves Poland-Liteuan.
 But he doesn't return home.

366
00:39:03.480 --> 00:39:10.440
Peter the Great has taken Narva and mastered a large part of the Baltic -

367
00:39:10.600 --> 00:39:16.160
- So Karl XII heads east with his soldiers, towards the Russian army.

368
00:39:16.320 --> 00:39:22.680
It will lead to the end of a long series of successes for Karl XII.

369
00:39:26.720 --> 00:39:33.960
On the way to the Russian army, Stålhammar writes to his wife Sofia Drake.

370
00:39:34.120 --> 00:39:39.160
He has been in the field for many years.
 She is worried that he is falling for temptation.

371
00:39:39.320 --> 00:39:43.400
But he assures her: "I'm faithful to you."

372
00:39:43.560 --> 00:39:47.920
Despite the fact that Stålhammar tried to discourage the children from becoming soldiers -

373
00:39:48.080 --> 00:39:53.400
- So seventeen -year -old son Johan Adolf joins the father in the field.

374
00:39:53.560 --> 00:39:59.120
And now Stålhammar has to send bad news to his wife.

375
00:40:02.880 --> 00:40:09.000
The son Johan Adolf has been shot in his leg.
 But steel hammers comfort:

376
00:40:09.160 --> 00:40:16.480
"Don't worry. The boy will survive, the wound is not deep."

377
00:40:16.640 --> 00:40:20.120
But a week later Sofia gets a new letter -

378
00:40:20.280 --> 00:40:24.720
- Where Stålhammar tells us that the son is dead:

379
00:40:24.880 --> 00:40:29.360
"Wound fever put in, no medicine helped."

380
00:40:29.520 --> 00:40:32.000
"I'm of the heart sad" -

381
00:40:32.160 --> 00:40:36.760
- "But what can you do other than to submit to God's gracious will?"

382
00:40:36.920 --> 00:40:41.000
"Now at least the boy doesn't have to suffer more, avoiding this world" -

383
00:40:41.160 --> 00:40:45.240
- "which is so full of sin and pain."

384
00:40:54.240 --> 00:40:57.840
Even Major Stålhammar dies later that year -

385
00:40:58.000 --> 00:41:03.000
- On November 3, 1708 on the border with Ukraine.

386
00:41:03.160 --> 00:41:08.000
The pain of war affects both poor and rich.

387
00:41:16.520 --> 00:41:23.360
At the end of August 1709, the news reaches Sweden for a terrible defeat.

388
00:41:23.520 --> 00:41:26.800
A disaster has hit Karl XII's army.

389
00:41:26.960 --> 00:41:32.960
The Swedish main force has been wiped out by the Russians at Poltava.

390
00:41:36.120 --> 00:41:39.320
After the loss at Poltava–

391
00:41:39.480 --> 00:41:46.040
- A large number of prisoners of war will be added to Russia, maybe 20,000.

392
00:41:46.200 --> 00:41:51.720
Soldiers such as civilians, men as women, become prisoners of war -

393
00:41:51.880 --> 00:41:56.480
- In various locations in Russia, where they will perform criminal work.

394
00:41:56.640 --> 00:42:01.120
Many of them never revisit their homeland again.

395
00:42:01.280 --> 00:42:05.320
After the defeat, Karl XII goes to Bender in Moldova -

396
00:42:05.480 --> 00:42:08.480
- Where he is protected by the Ottoman Sultan.

397
00:42:08.640 --> 00:42:14.760
With him he has only 1,300 soldiers - those left by his large army.

398
00:42:14.920 --> 00:42:19.880
According to him, Poltava was just a temporary defeat.
 He writes:

399
00:42:20.040 --> 00:42:26.960
"The war must continue. The Council must raise money for a new army."

400
00:42:30.840 --> 00:42:34.840
To recruit, equip and train a brand new field army -

401
00:42:35.000 --> 00:42:39.280
- As is to be shipped across the continent to the king, is not easy.

402
00:42:39.440 --> 00:42:46.160
The Swedish people have already been hard tested by famine and the burden of war.

403
00:42:47.760 --> 00:42:51.720
And new difficulties are soon on the way.

404
00:42:51.880 --> 00:42:56.600
In June 1710, a hungry sea captain manages to throw past the guards -

405
00:42:56.760 --> 00:43:00.760
- As will keep all ships in quarantine to protect Stockholm.

406
00:43:00.920 --> 00:43:06.120
At a tavern just outside the capital, the captain suddenly dies ...

407
00:43:06.920 --> 00:43:09.320
... infected by the plague.

408
00:43:22.520 --> 00:43:26.120
The dreaded disease is back in Stockholm.

409
00:43:26.280 --> 00:43:32.400
People get sick in high fever, with large bumps in groin and armpits.

410
00:43:32.560 --> 00:43:35.600
Most die within a couple of days.

411
00:43:49.960 --> 00:43:55.840
The worst spreads here among the poor and crowded at Södermalm.

412
00:43:56.000 --> 00:43:59.000
But the disease does not spare social strata.

413
00:44:08.360 --> 00:44:12.160
The plague -hit homes are marked with a white cross on the door.

414
00:44:12.320 --> 00:44:17.320
Funerals, weddings, baptisms and parties are canceled and the schools are kept closed.

415
00:44:17.480 --> 00:44:24.080
No loose animals may be found on the streets.
 Thousands of dogs and cats are killed.

416
00:44:26.040 --> 00:44:30.720
In Stockholm, almost 22,000 died, of a population of 55,000.

417
00:44:30.880 --> 00:44:35.400
Almost half the population died in just six months.

418
00:44:42.080 --> 00:44:46.080
Karl XII remains in the Ottoman Empire for several years.

419
00:44:46.240 --> 00:44:51.040
He tries to get the Turkish Sultan to help Sweden against the Russians -

420
00:44:51.200 --> 00:44:55.840
- But fails.
 And despite the fact that the Swedish people are hard pressed -

421
00:44:56.000 --> 00:45:00.680
- So Karl XII now wants even more resources for his army.

422
00:45:00.840 --> 00:45:05.720
He decides that everyone in Sweden should pay 2 percent of everything they own -

423
00:45:05.880 --> 00:45:12.200
- In a new treasure.
 And it hits hard against the already poor Swedes.

424
00:45:16.600 --> 00:45:22.280
The tax becomes another burden that the people will carry.

425
00:45:28.600 --> 00:45:35.000
Because of the wars, new amounts of men are constantly written into the armies.

426
00:45:35.160 --> 00:45:41.000
In the end, it becomes difficult to get men to the armies -

427
00:45:41.160 --> 00:45:44.360
- And it will be a big surplus of women.

428
00:45:44.520 --> 00:45:49.120
In Stockholm, as much as 60 percent of the population consists of women -

429
00:45:49.280 --> 00:45:52.280
- What is likely to be world -unique.

430
00:45:55.440 --> 00:45:58.880
It leads to some other world -unique:

431
00:45:59.040 --> 00:46:03.440
The female thieves become more than the male in Stockholm.

432
00:46:03.600 --> 00:46:08.040
In normal cases, thieves are a male occupation.

433
00:46:09.200 --> 00:46:13.360
Not only thieves are looking for exchanges at the Stockholm pubs.

434
00:46:13.520 --> 00:46:16.840
The enrollers are looking for new soldiers.

435
00:46:17.000 --> 00:46:21.520
The system created by Karl XII's father was intended for defense -

436
00:46:21.680 --> 00:46:26.760
- And the soldiers are not enough for Karl XII's major war company.

437
00:46:26.920 --> 00:46:32.800
So to obtain new soldiers, the authorities take to questionable methods.

438
00:46:32.960 --> 00:46:37.560
The enrollers had tricks to make the young men become soldiers.

439
00:46:37.720 --> 00:46:42.320
Officially, it was voluntary and an honor to become the king's soldier.

440
00:46:42.480 --> 00:46:45.560
But many needed to be persuaded.

441
00:47:00.760 --> 00:47:08.040
In 1714, Karl XII has fought for 14 years.
 It is now bad for soldiers and money.

442
00:47:08.200 --> 00:47:14.160
Karl XII returns to Sweden from his long campaign abroad.

443
00:47:14.320 --> 00:47:19.200
Many people hope that it can finally be peace.
 But it won't be.

444
00:47:19.360 --> 00:47:23.520
The king tries to negotiate peace, but fails.

445
00:47:23.680 --> 00:47:28.840
New mobilization is needed.
 New soldiers and new treasures.

446
00:47:29.000 --> 00:47:34.560
The king takes all possible means.
 He takes international loans-

447
00:47:34.720 --> 00:47:39.120
- And many emergency coins are characterized, which will stimulate the economy.

448
00:47:46.800 --> 00:47:51.000
It may seem strange that the protests -

449
00:47:51.160 --> 00:47:58.600
–Mot Karl XII's regime, the war companies and the war policy -

450
00:47:58.760 --> 00:48:01.760
- Not more extensive than they were.

451
00:48:01.920 --> 00:48:07.640
There were protests, but on a very small scale.

452
00:48:07.800 --> 00:48:14.080
Going against a single king, selected by God, is unthinkable for most.

453
00:48:25.360 --> 00:48:29.880
A new generation of soldiers are now being printed.

454
00:48:42.440 --> 00:48:45.840
As Sweden is again at war with Denmark -

455
00:48:46.000 --> 00:48:49.880
–Chink Karl XII attack the Danes by entering Norway -

456
00:48:50.040 --> 00:48:54.800
- As at this time, part of the Danish empire is.

457
00:48:57.720 --> 00:49:02.360
The kingdom's baking rooms are now given a role in the king's new strategy.

458
00:49:04.120 --> 00:49:10.720
For the army has very little to live in the barren Norwegian landscape.

459
00:49:10.880 --> 00:49:15.240
The king lets bake a nutritious and durable bread.

460
00:49:18.640 --> 00:49:22.800
The result is a compact and dry crust -

461
00:49:22.960 --> 00:49:25.960
- As has to be soaked to eat.

462
00:49:28.360 --> 00:49:35.040
This device engaged a large part of the country's bakers-

463
00:49:35.200 --> 00:49:41.200
–And all sorts of groups that were allowed to porch food -

464
00:49:41.360 --> 00:49:45.920
- To special magazines along the Norwegian border.

465
00:49:46.080 --> 00:49:50.200
The idea is that the Carolines themselves should carry parts of their food -

466
00:49:50.360 --> 00:49:55.600
- To be able to fight without being dependent on the enemy resources.

467
00:49:57.880 --> 00:50:03.560
An effect of this huge organization where -

468
00:50:03.720 --> 00:50:10.320
- The civilian sequence was reduced precisely because it was not needed.

469
00:50:10.480 --> 00:50:17.200
His crusts are precursors to the soldiers' field food even in our time.

470
00:50:17.360 --> 00:50:22.560
It was an innovation in military strategy, one could say -

471
00:50:22.720 --> 00:50:26.720
- Organizing the food attitude in this way.

472
00:50:36.600 --> 00:50:40.160
Although Sweden's people are depleted and war -tired -

473
00:50:40.320 --> 00:50:44.440
- Is Karl XII's soldiers still loyal.

474
00:50:44.600 --> 00:50:49.360
They see the king closest as a mythical figure, someone who is invulnerable -

475
00:50:49.520 --> 00:50:52.720
- And maybe even immortal.

476
00:50:57.840 --> 00:51:00.920
Karl XII has fortified the image of himself -

477
00:51:01.080 --> 00:51:05.080
- As a fearless leader who fights with his men.

478
00:51:05.240 --> 00:51:11.600
And so it was also this evening, November 30, 1718 in Norway.

479
00:51:15.520 --> 00:51:19.920
The king inspects the siege work in the dark.

480
00:51:20.080 --> 00:51:24.840
Cannons at this time sometimes fired so -called mapsch shoots -

481
00:51:25.000 --> 00:51:30.000
–Dvs.
 A shotgun of old scrap and balls of different sizes.

482
00:51:31.560 --> 00:51:35.760
Suddenly, Karl XII is met by a projectile in the temple.

483
00:51:35.920 --> 00:51:39.720
Probably it is such a shot from the Norwegian side -

484
00:51:39.880 --> 00:51:44.720
- Which goes straight through the king's skull and kills him immediately.

485
00:51:53.160 --> 00:51:57.720
And the Swedish military state stops.

486
00:51:57.880 --> 00:52:00.560
Carolines, the proud army -

487
00:52:00.720 --> 00:52:05.400
- As so often surprised and struck out of the disadvantage, collapses.

488
00:52:05.560 --> 00:52:09.760
The famous fashion and cohesion are gone.

489
00:52:29.040 --> 00:52:34.360
The great warrior king is dead.
 The news strikes like a bomb.

490
00:52:34.520 --> 00:52:38.520
The great power is over, and for generations, man - will

491
00:52:38.680 --> 00:52:43.240
- To look back at and romanticize this era.

492
00:52:43.400 --> 00:52:49.560
166 years after the king's death, Gustaf Cederström paints this board.

493
00:52:50.720 --> 00:52:56.920
It will long be the mindset for how Karl XII's equality went.

494
00:52:57.080 --> 00:53:02.120
It expresses not only a beaten army, but also a people in mourning.

495
00:53:02.280 --> 00:53:07.440
But the artist took liberties.
 This was not how it went.

496
00:53:08.640 --> 00:53:14.480
It was a much simpler story.
 He is placed in a pine with a lid.

497
00:53:14.640 --> 00:53:19.040
In this way you transport the king, not over the mountain.

498
00:53:19.200 --> 00:53:24.520
The Swedish border is crossed at Svinesund, on a barge or via a raft bridge.

499
00:53:24.680 --> 00:53:28.000
Eventually this corpse comes to Uddevalla -

500
00:53:28.160 --> 00:53:33.720
- Where you also make a more lavish coffin of oak.

501
00:53:33.880 --> 00:53:37.680
The death sentence reaches the force that has entered Norway for a long time north-

502
00:53:37.840 --> 00:53:41.520
- With soldiers from mainly Finland, but also from Norrland.

503
00:53:41.680 --> 00:53:47.160
Lieutenant General Carl Gustaf Armfeldt leads a strength of about 6,000 men.

504
00:53:47.320 --> 00:53:51.360
On New Year's Eve, they start their return over the mountains.

505
00:53:51.520 --> 00:53:57.120
It is terribly cold and they have far too poor equipment.

506
00:53:57.280 --> 00:54:00.280
They are bad with clothes and bad with food.

507
00:54:11.040 --> 00:54:15.800
A storm strikes when the strength reached the mountain side.

508
00:54:41.680 --> 00:54:47.640
At least 3,000 soldiers remained in the mountains, dead.

509
00:54:47.800 --> 00:54:54.720
And of those who survived, around 600 people suffered injuries for life.

510
00:55:25.880 --> 00:55:29.520
The wars are not over just because the king dies.

511
00:55:29.680 --> 00:55:33.920
When Karl XII's sister Ulrika Eleonora is crowned to Queen -

512
00:55:34.080 --> 00:55:38.520
- She and the Royal Council negotiate peace with Russia.

513
00:55:38.680 --> 00:55:41.680
But the negotiations drag on over time.

514
00:55:41.840 --> 00:55:45.560
For several years, Russian forces occupy Finland-

515
00:55:45.720 --> 00:55:49.120
–And Fire Rarms settlements and cities along the coast -

516
00:55:49.280 --> 00:55:54.040
- From Luleå and Piteå in the north to Norrköping in the south.

517
00:56:02.880 --> 00:56:09.320
But there will be peace with Denmark, for payment of damages and customs.

518
00:56:09.480 --> 00:56:13.480
And then with Russia.
 And some of the Swedish soldiers -

519
00:56:13.640 --> 00:56:18.440
- Which has been prisoners of war in Russia, now manages to get home.

520
00:56:28.960 --> 00:56:33.680
But the Sweden they left is not the same.

521
00:56:36.960 --> 00:56:41.800
After so many years, many soldiers have been declared dead -

522
00:56:41.960 --> 00:56:46.680
–And their wives then have married a new soldier -

523
00:56:46.840 --> 00:56:51.040
- To cope with everyday life and keep their home.

524
00:57:05.160 --> 00:57:11.280
Sweden is forced to leave the territories in the Baltics and around the Baltic Sea.

525
00:57:11.440 --> 00:57:15.840
The attempts to defend the superpower had a high price.

526
00:57:16.000 --> 00:57:20.000
For 100 years, up to 1721, so you count on -

527
00:57:20.160 --> 00:57:25.840
- The third adult Swedish man dies in the service of the army or the fleet.

528
00:57:26.000 --> 00:57:29.240
But now the great power is over.

529
00:57:32.800 --> 00:57:35.560
New winds are starting to blow.

530
00:57:35.720 --> 00:57:41.720
New goods and new thoughts from the world outside should push away the old -

531
00:57:41.880 --> 00:57:47.160
- And change society and the life of the Swedes.

532
00:58:00.760 --> 00:58:05.080
