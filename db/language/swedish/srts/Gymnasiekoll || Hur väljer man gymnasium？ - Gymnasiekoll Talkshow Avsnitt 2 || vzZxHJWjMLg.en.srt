1
00:00:02,064 --> 00:00:04,532
Does it feel good?
 Do you feel ready?

2
00:00:04,888 --> 00:00:08,192
Before now?
 After all, there are three principals who want to come here and talk to me.

3
00:00:08,888 --> 00:00:13,192
Well, you just have to interview them?
 It's an interview.

4
00:00:13,480 --> 00:00:16,000
Well!
 I thought I was called to the headmaster.

5
00:00:16,080 --> 00:00:19,000
Well, no, no.
 They come here and you talk to them.
 It is quiet.

6
00:00:19,092 --> 00:00:20,136
Yeah.

7
00:00:26,392 --> 00:00:28,928
Today we continue the journey towards your high school choice.

8
00:00:29,184 --> 00:00:31,424
Today we are going to cave in program selection and school choices

9
00:00:31,580 --> 00:00:34,348
And how to find out what is right for you.

10
00:00:34,816 --> 00:00:38,632
I have invited principals and high school students who will help us with this.

11
00:00:39,168 --> 00:00:41,728
Warm welcome here Caroline and Viggo.

12
00:00:42,496 --> 00:00:45,824
You work as a principal.
 How come you became?

13
00:00:46,336 --> 00:00:48,000
I work as assistant principal

14
00:00:48,058 --> 00:00:52,224
And five years ago received about an offer of a principal service.

15
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:57,344
And chose to jump on it because I think it is extremely inspiring to get

16
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:00,672
Join the youth's journey towards adulthood.

17
00:01:00,928 --> 00:01:01,996
To be involved and influence.

18
00:01:02,208 --> 00:01:04,000
You go second in high school.

19
00:01:04,512 --> 00:01:05,580
What program do you go?

20
00:01:06,048 --> 00:01:07,400
The plumbing and real estate program.

21
00:01:07,472 --> 00:01:10,264
How come you chose plumbing and real estate?

22
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:11,680
Yes it was in nine.

23
00:01:11,936 --> 00:01:15,776
Then I didn't really know what to go but then I found out that it is easy to get a job.

24
00:01:16,032 --> 00:01:19,308
After the plumbing and real estate program.
 And you get to work very practically.

25
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:22,384
But that is also theory.
 So that was the right profession.

26
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:24,224
Sounds like a good choice after all.

27
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:28,240
Do you have any tips that you usually give students to make their high school choice?

28
00:01:28,576 --> 00:01:32,672
I think there is such a large selection and that it is important to

29
00:01:32,928 --> 00:01:37,324
Start from their interests or an area that you are curious about.

30
00:01:37,480 --> 00:01:42,864
And don't get into the trap of choosing what your friends choose.

31
00:01:43,168 --> 00:01:44,960
Find out as much as possible about

32
00:01:45,216 --> 00:01:50,556
The schools that offer an education because it is the environment and atmosphere, the school's teachers.

33
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:56,772
It is of great importance for what you get for feeling.
 I think you should go on a nice feeling you get.

34
00:01:56,968 --> 00:01:58,272
Really, good tips!

35
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:02,200
There are any benefits to choosing a practical education.

36
00:02:02,368 --> 00:02:07,744
Yes it absolutely does.
 If you enjoy working practically, it is a good education.

37
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,248
Being able to alternate both theory and practice.

38
00:02:10,304 --> 00:02:11,940
Try the profession in working life.

39
00:02:12,096 --> 00:02:15,576
Get contacts and experiences that often also lead to jobs.

40
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:19,820
You will go out on APL later this year for the first time.
 How do you think about it?

41
00:02:20,288 --> 00:02:25,464
We had no kind of practice out in the field in one but now in second

42
00:02:25,588 --> 00:02:28,224
Then we get to know what the environment is.

43
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:33,600
We learn how it is for real, to be out and work with the profession we will work with.

44
00:02:33,856 --> 00:02:36,999
Great opportunity to test at the high school already.

45
00:02:37,184 --> 00:02:39,964
Are there any prejudices against practical education, Caroline?

46
00:02:40,256 --> 00:02:41,816
Yes but there is.

47
00:02:42,072 --> 00:02:47,820
One prejudice is that if you go for a practical education, you cannot read further at college and university.

48
00:02:47,980 --> 00:02:48,704
Which one can.

49
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:55,360
Another prejudice is that girls should not choose a vocational education in, for example, construction and plumbing.

50
00:02:55,872 --> 00:02:59,980
Which, of course, you should, because it has nothing to do with your gender.

51
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:07,004
A third prejudice is that vocational education is not for students who are study -motivated but students who are tired.

52
00:03:07,050 --> 00:03:09,416
That's not true either.

53
00:03:09,952 --> 00:03:15,016
You should go out on practice a lot during your education and the industry places demands on our young people.

54
00:03:15,328 --> 00:03:17,632
Good prejudice and myths to punch holes.

55
00:03:17,888 --> 00:03:21,772
Is there anything that is not what you believed in high school?

56
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:29,128
Well, with the plumbing profession, you can think that there are very shabby premises and tools and stuff there.

57
00:03:29,664 --> 00:03:31,888
Maybe some prejudice against the plumbing installers.

58
00:03:31,938 --> 00:03:36,064
But these are clean premises, they were newly built when we arrived.

59
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:41,428
We got new tools this week.
 It is pure pipes, everything is recycled when we use it.

60
00:03:41,696 --> 00:03:44,256
Thank you very much for being here and answered my questions today.

61
00:03:44,512 --> 00:03:45,536
Thank you for coming.

62
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:49,376
Warmly welcome the lottery here and Frida.

63
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:54,272
After all, you work as principal, Lotten.
 What is the most fun thing about your job?

64
00:03:54,496 --> 00:03:58,640
There are many things that are fun with my job but I feel enough to

65
00:03:58,896 --> 00:04:03,712
What is really fantastic about the job is to not only work with the students' learning

66
00:04:03,968 --> 00:04:07,812
Without many young people today want to do something more you want to change the world.

67
00:04:07,908 --> 00:04:12,000
I think Greta Thunberg is an incredibly good example of that.

68
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:17,990
So being able to participate and enable students to give students a platform for their commitment,

69
00:04:18,006 --> 00:04:23,999
I think that's really, really fun.
 To catch it and make sure they have the opportunity to develop it.

70
00:04:24,191 --> 00:04:26,495
To simply improve the world.
 The small project.

71
00:04:26,751 --> 00:04:28,031
I understand that.
 How fun.

72
00:04:28,287 --> 00:04:31,551
And Frida, you go in second to high school.
 What program do you go?

73
00:04:31,700 --> 00:04:32,999
I read Sam behavior.

74
00:04:33,407 --> 00:04:35,543
Why did you just choose that program?

75
00:04:35,711 --> 00:04:39,807
I chose it because I am very interested in the orientation courses that exist.

76
00:04:40,343 --> 00:04:43,391
That is: sociology, philosophy, psychology.

77
00:04:43,647 --> 00:04:46,463
How people work.
 Why they work that way.

78
00:04:46,719 --> 00:04:49,767
How do you think you should think about your high school choice?

79
00:04:50,047 --> 00:04:53,851
I think you should start from a little what you are really good at.

80
00:04:53,907 --> 00:04:58,851
That's part.
 And what you think is fun.
 And it usually is connected.

81
00:04:59,007 --> 00:05:03,851
Just as Frida is about looking at what it is for in -depth courses and thinking about it.

82
00:05:03,907 --> 00:05:09,251
But then of course you should think about what conditions you want to get in the future.

83
00:05:09,307 --> 00:05:13,855
What do you want to bring with you when you take the student.
 That is the goal of high school time.

84
00:05:14,111 --> 00:05:16,971
That after the student is ready for the next step in life.

85
00:05:17,183 --> 00:05:19,231
What is it like to study the community program?

86
00:05:19,487 --> 00:05:24,323
I think it's very fun.
 You can, as I said, learn a lot about how people work.

87
00:05:24,479 --> 00:05:28,123
Which is something I and my friends bring home too.
 We can tell our parents that:

88
00:05:28,179 --> 00:05:31,223
Oh now you used that method and now you did so there.

89
00:05:31,309 --> 00:05:36,203
You learn a lot that is good both now and in the future.
 Things you can use all your life.

90
00:05:36,230 --> 00:05:40,735
Are there any benefits to choosing a more classic, theoretical program?

91
00:05:41,247 --> 00:05:47,191
There are many benefits I think.
 The most obvious is that one is ready to seek

92
00:05:47,247 --> 00:05:49,371
University and college after the student.

93
00:05:49,399 --> 00:05:55,071
You have with you in a degree that provides the opportunity for further studies and what we work with.

94
00:05:55,327 --> 00:05:58,371
This is what Frida and the rest of the students should move on.

95
00:05:58,427 --> 00:06:02,471
But then it is also that you are obviously challenged academically and theoretically.

96
00:06:02,727 --> 00:06:07,079
If you think it is fun, you should of course choose a theoretical program in high school.

97
00:06:08,127 --> 00:06:09,663
Are there any prejudices?

98
00:06:09,919 --> 00:06:16,363
I don't think there are so many prejudices specifically against the theoretical programs.
 I don't experience that.

99
00:06:16,419 --> 00:06:20,795
But on the other hand, there are prejudices about the various individual programs perhaps.

100
00:06:21,951 --> 00:06:25,871
It is thought that the finance program is this way and financial students are this way.

101
00:06:25,971 --> 00:06:29,271
And nature students are this way.
 You look in a certain way.

102
00:06:29,375 --> 00:06:35,519
There are prejudice about that.
 However, I think there may be a common misconception.

103
00:06:35,775 --> 00:06:38,871
It is thought that the technology program looks the same at all schools and so on.

104
00:06:39,127 --> 00:06:45,167
There are greater differences within one and the same program against what it does between the programs.

105
00:06:45,223 --> 00:06:49,951
My technology students who attend technology -technology for example and become an environmental engineer,

106
00:06:50,007 --> 00:06:55,251
They have a lot in common with our nature students and read quite similar courses.

107
00:06:55,307 --> 00:07:00,951
So there the difference is greater to other technology students who may read information and media technology.

108
00:07:01,007 --> 00:07:06,751
So I think you should be very aware of when applying for high school as year 9.

109
00:07:07,263 --> 00:07:12,000
Is it something that you didn't think it would be in high school?

110
00:07:12,383 --> 00:07:15,711
No I wouldn't say that something came as a great shock.

111
00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:20,623
Then I think many people have some expectations that if you go for a cooperation, for example, that

112
00:07:20,879 --> 00:07:25,795
"Wow we will learn about psychopaths and criminology" and all that fun directly.

113
00:07:25,951 --> 00:07:28,999
But what you may forget that it takes a lot of background learning first.

114
00:07:29,023 --> 00:07:31,939
You have to learn a lot about the backgrounds in the various subjects.

115
00:07:32,095 --> 00:07:36,539
And it may well be good to be prepared for it.
 So that you do not come and so you are completely disappointed.

116
00:07:37,095 --> 00:07:40,239
It will come to an end, but you have to start with the background.

117
00:07:40,543 --> 00:07:45,151
The first lesson may not be the most fun.
 It comes a little further.

118
00:07:45,407 --> 00:07:46,175
Well, how nice.

119
00:07:46,431 --> 00:07:49,247
Thank you very much for answering my questions.

120
00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:50,271
Thanks.

121
00:07:51,551 --> 00:07:54,111
Warm welcome here Petter and Elin.

122
00:07:54,367 --> 00:07:55,903
Thanks.
 Fun to have you here.

123
00:07:56,671 --> 00:08:02,200
You work as a principal.
 How did you become the headmaster of a creative school?

124
00:08:02,559 --> 00:08:05,355
Working with young people is absolutely fantastic, seeing them grow.

125
00:08:05,405 --> 00:08:10,495
But working with creative young people is so wonderful because they have a little extra energy.

126
00:08:11,007 --> 00:08:12,799
One may look the bloom

127
00:08:13,567 --> 00:08:19,711
And get this creative as they create stuff.
 It is absolutely wonderful to see it happen in reality.

128
00:08:20,003 --> 00:08:25,087
I really understand that.
 Here we also have a creative youth with us today.

129
00:08:25,343 --> 00:08:27,947
You go in the third now which program do you read?

130
00:08:28,159 --> 00:08:32,575
I go the aesthetic line with a focus on photo and film.

131
00:08:32,767 --> 00:08:34,947
Fun.
 Why did you just choose that?

132
00:08:35,071 --> 00:08:37,119
For me, it was important to be creative.

133
00:08:37,631 --> 00:08:43,775
But also to go for a college preparation line so that I could choose what I wanted to do.

134
00:08:44,287 --> 00:08:47,799
What kind of questions do you usually get from students who want to start with you?

135
00:08:48,383 --> 00:08:51,711
You often get very specific questions.

136
00:08:51,967 --> 00:08:53,503
And sometimes a little more general.

137
00:08:54,015 --> 00:08:59,367
But general is about what kind of students it is, what does the schedule look like and such things.

138
00:08:59,647 --> 00:09:07,071
But then it is very very specific.
 The creative professions are often linked to the industry that is aimed at.

139
00:09:07,327 --> 00:09:09,163
It is very much about equipment for example.

140
00:09:09,375 --> 00:09:12,703
What computers do you have, do you have Wacom plates?

141
00:09:13,215 --> 00:09:18,563
What software is used and such things.
 This is what is important for many students.

142
00:09:18,691 --> 00:09:22,735
Great to hear that they are in control of it then even before they start.

143
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:27,735
Yes indeed.
 And it is often because they have a special interest and want to continue with it.

144
00:09:27,991 --> 00:09:31,183
They want to develop even more within them.
 So we have to have a fairly high standard and quality

145
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:35,987
In order for the students to be satisfied with the equipment and what they meet in school later.

146
00:09:36,255 --> 00:09:39,047
How would you say that a regular week at school looks like?

147
00:09:39,327 --> 00:09:41,063
For me, it may be due to the schedule.

148
00:09:41,375 --> 00:09:45,223
Shorter lessons to more theoretical lessons and theoretical subjects.

149
00:09:45,265 --> 00:09:50,879
Then we have the long lessons for more creative so that you really get time to do things.

150
00:09:51,103 --> 00:09:54,175
And then so on the breaks there may be people sitting in the hall

151
00:09:54,431 --> 00:09:58,883
and playing games.
 I always sit with my friends and play cards before my lessons.

152
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:02,487
So it is usually very fun and have good energy in the hall.

153
00:10:02,623 --> 00:10:04,159
It actually sounds really fun.

154
00:10:05,183 --> 00:10:08,487
Are there any common prejudices against a creative education.

155
00:10:08,767 --> 00:10:15,167
Absolutely.
 After all, we have prejudices about the types of students that are estates.

156
00:10:15,423 --> 00:10:16,191
It is a classic.

157
00:10:16,703 --> 00:10:21,263
And then I usually say that everyone is different, after all,

158
00:10:21,325 --> 00:10:26,887
And you can be yourself in creative education.
 So it doesn't matter who you are.
 Everyone is welcome.

159
00:10:27,199 --> 00:10:32,327
And then we have it with college preparation.
 Is it a college preparation to go to an aesthetic program?

160
00:10:32,587 --> 00:10:35,779
That's it.
 All the aesthetic programs are college preparatory.

161
00:10:35,903 --> 00:10:40,463
Most aesthetic schools also offer the courses you need for special permits.

162
00:10:40,791 --> 00:10:44,559
It can be important for the students to bring with you if you want to be specifically late.

163
00:10:45,375 --> 00:10:50,239
Are these knowledge really applicable in reality?

164
00:10:50,751 --> 00:10:56,799
What do I become if I am good at keeping up with 3D models or maybe game graphics.

165
00:10:56,939 --> 00:11:00,943
Should you niche so narrow already when you are so young?

166
00:11:01,035 --> 00:11:05,599
Then I usually say that these knowledge is applicable even after school.

167
00:11:06,111 --> 00:11:11,455
I have companies that contact me and ask "Can't your students come to us and make 3D models?"

168
00:11:11,535 --> 00:11:18,959
Because it is an important knowledge to have also against other industries other than just the gaming industry.

169
00:11:19,079 --> 00:11:21,215
It can be architectural firms.

170
00:11:21,727 --> 00:11:26,587
Tech companies that are doing AR and that want you to be able to do such things simply.

171
00:11:26,847 --> 00:11:31,791
Cool, you learn to be prepared for change and to learn new things.

172
00:11:31,847 --> 00:11:43,807
Really, being able to use your creative qualities makes it easier to be flexible and enter into new contexts.

173
00:11:44,511 --> 00:11:45,279
Cool.

174
00:11:45,791 --> 00:11:50,287
Is there anything that is not as you thought it would be before you started high school?

175
00:11:50,655 --> 00:11:56,287
Firstly, I thought the teachers would be more strict and strict in a way.

176
00:11:56,543 --> 00:12:02,943
There are teachers who say no one will be able to handle my course.
 Like it's a good thing to say.

177
00:12:03,199 --> 00:12:07,839
But the teachers on the aesthetic line are very understanding.

178
00:12:08,063 --> 00:12:11,939
They often have the same interests as the students.
 I go photo and movie.

179
00:12:12,005 --> 00:12:16,287
Many of my photo and film teachers have worked in photography themselves.

180
00:12:16,343 --> 00:12:21,607
Then they have an interest in it and it makes a difference.
 They are as enthusiastic as one is.

181
00:12:21,863 --> 00:12:27,100
They are also very kind with submissions and they give a second chance so to speak.

182
00:12:27,159 --> 00:12:30,979
So that you can really succeed in being able to take the student and everything like that.

183
00:12:31,359 --> 00:12:33,383
I had not expected that from school simply.

184
00:12:33,919 --> 00:12:34,431
How fun.

185
00:12:34,687 --> 00:12:36,735
Think it is exciting to take part in their

186
00:12:37,247 --> 00:12:40,671
Stories from their previous working life as well.
 Yes exactly.

187
00:12:41,343 --> 00:12:44,159
Big thanks for being with us today and answering my questions.

188
00:12:44,415 --> 00:12:44,927
Thanks.

189
00:12:46,463 --> 00:12:52,327
We will pick up the lottery and Viggo again to run a moment we call true or false.

190
00:12:56,959 --> 00:12:58,239
Do everyone feel ready?

191
00:12:58,495 --> 00:12:59,775
YES!

192
00:13:00,031 --> 00:13:05,027
Great!
 I will say a statement and then you must be true or false.

193
00:13:05,151 --> 00:13:06,575
Just as you think.

194
00:13:07,711 --> 00:13:08,223
First.

195
00:13:08,991 --> 00:13:14,207
The high school choice is crucial to your entire future.

196
00:13:14,623 --> 00:13:15,391
Quickly false.

197
00:13:15,903 --> 00:13:18,207
Only guys read technology.

198
00:13:20,511 --> 00:13:24,607
Same again, false, exactly.
 After all, it has absolutely nothing to do with what gender you have.

199
00:13:24,863 --> 00:13:27,567
You can fit into any school.

200
00:13:29,727 --> 00:13:31,775
You agree again.
 True you say.

201
00:13:32,031 --> 00:13:33,055
How do you think Petter?

202
00:13:33,567 --> 00:13:39,199
When choosing high school, you quite often choose a specific school or a specific education.

203
00:13:39,455 --> 00:13:44,575
So then there are very often students who in some way have the same starting position as you.

204
00:13:45,343 --> 00:13:50,823
So it's very easy to fit in there.
 Then at school we have a responsibility to make sure

205
00:13:50,975 --> 00:13:54,935
that the students land nicely into their education to develop as well as possible.

206
00:13:56,351 --> 00:13:56,863
Next.

207
00:13:57,119 --> 00:14:00,191
It is best to choose what their friends choose.

208
00:14:01,983 --> 00:14:02,595
False.

209
00:14:03,007 --> 00:14:03,975
How do you think Elin?

210
00:14:04,799 --> 00:14:09,151
I had a buddy group in elementary school as many others have.

211
00:14:09,663 --> 00:14:15,223
But I was the only one who chose the aesthetic even though we all liked the aesthetic.
 They wanted to aim for something else.

212
00:14:15,551 --> 00:14:19,987
But I felt I wanted to do something that is important to me.

213
00:14:20,159 --> 00:14:25,375
And it is very important because otherwise you will only have three years that you have no commitment to.

214
00:14:25,535 --> 00:14:29,515
So do what is most important to you.

215
00:14:29,887 --> 00:14:32,703
You get new friends.
 Exactly.
 It is also important.

216
00:14:32,959 --> 00:14:36,999
What you learn in high school is not relevant in ten years.

217
00:14:40,383 --> 00:14:42,687
Here we have slightly different answers, exciting.

218
00:14:42,943 --> 00:14:44,267
How do you think the lot?

219
00:14:44,735 --> 00:14:48,575
I think that high school above all teaches one to learn things.

220
00:14:48,831 --> 00:14:51,555
Hopefully learning a lifelong learning.

221
00:14:51,651 --> 00:14:58,423
Whether you go further college or university studies or if you go out directly in working life as some others do.

222
00:14:58,559 --> 00:15:04,983
So you have learned and gained the capacity to get into the next step and then develop and learn things.

223
00:15:05,215 --> 00:15:06,627
How do you think Viggo?

224
00:15:06,751 --> 00:15:12,639
I think much of these SO subjects and NO subjects, religion and history.

225
00:15:12,895 --> 00:15:14,943
It is something that you might just plug in for a test.

226
00:15:15,199 --> 00:15:16,479
Then you forget it.

227
00:15:16,735 --> 00:15:19,295
It does not feel like we will use it in the future.

228
00:15:19,807 --> 00:15:22,599
It is better to focus on what has to do with the profession.

229
00:15:23,903 --> 00:15:29,791
Maybe sometime in a quiz so you can get a question from the lessons.

230
00:15:31,071 --> 00:15:33,375
It's fun to go to high school.

231
00:15:35,935 --> 00:15:38,783
Nice that everyone agrees here.

232
00:15:39,007 --> 00:15:41,311
What do you think Elin.
 Why is it fun to go to high school.

233
00:15:41,567 --> 00:15:44,127
It depends a lot on which school you choose.

234
00:15:44,383 --> 00:15:47,987
So it is fun to take interest over something you want to take interest over.

235
00:15:48,223 --> 00:15:50,015
When elementary school in very wide

236
00:15:50,271 --> 00:15:53,599
over subjects and so on and trying to teach an everything,

237
00:15:53,855 --> 00:15:56,415
So you really have to focus on something in high school.

238
00:15:57,183 --> 00:16:02,719
It can be very engaging and it becomes much more fun to learn some stuff.

239
00:16:03,071 --> 00:16:05,263
I agree with it was great fun to go to high school.

240
00:16:05,631 --> 00:16:08,959
Thousand thanks!
 Well done all.
 Thanks!

241
00:16:10,495 --> 00:16:11,639
Big thanks to today's participants.

242
00:16:11,695 --> 00:16:17,639
As you can see, it is best to start from what you want to get a good and fun high school time.

243
00:16:18,175 --> 00:16:23,103
To be able to compare different programs or schools is to visit an open house a good tip.

244
00:16:23,551 --> 00:16:27,647
Under prevailing circumstances, several schools offer a digital version instead.

245
00:16:28,415 --> 00:16:31,943
Check out the websites for the schools that you are interested in.

246
00:16:32,255 --> 00:16:33,223
Thanks for today!

247
00:16:37,127 --> 00:16:41,171
It is really good to go to an open house because you get a really good picture of the school.

248
00:16:41,227 --> 00:16:44,071
The premises, where it lies, how to get there.

249
00:16:44,127 --> 00:16:47,971
And especially to meet other students who go to school and teachers.

250
00:16:48,127 --> 00:16:53,271
I was at several open houses where I got to see different schools and how it is at different high schools.

251
00:16:53,527 --> 00:16:56,271
Test on a student for a day.
 And then you get to feel.

252
00:16:56,427 --> 00:16:59,671
I was at several open houses.

253
00:17:00,927 --> 00:17:05,071
If you go to school you are interested in, you get a better feeling for it.

254
00:17:05,107 --> 00:17:07,571
And you can feel whether it is right for me or not.
