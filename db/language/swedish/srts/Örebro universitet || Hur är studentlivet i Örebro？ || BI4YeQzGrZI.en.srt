1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,400
- It's as you say.
 When you start here you are like this, will I get some friends?

2
00:00:05,400 --> 00:00:08,400
Because you come here yourself for the most part.

3
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:11,400
But I got friends too.
 Not to brag.
 - Lovely!

4
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:18,000
- To start with, you have the introduction immediately when you start.

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:19,720
Which is a great way to get to know people.

6
00:00:19,720 --> 00:00:22,920
Both in their own class, but also on other programs.

7
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:28,640
Several of those who are my closest friends today, I met the first few days when I came here.

8
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:29,840
So it's really fun!

9
00:00:29,840 --> 00:00:33,680
After that I was also the father of the following two semesters.
 - It is fun!

10
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:36,680
- It's really fun.
 You were also in your section?

11
00:00:36,680 --> 00:00:39,880
- It was me.
 Also very fun!
 And I'll be it again.

12
00:00:39,880 --> 00:00:41,000
- You're going to be that again?
 - Yeah!

13
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,120
- Fun!
 Never ends?
 - No!

14
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:46,440
- It was these first three weeks that really gave everything.

15
00:00:46,440 --> 00:00:50,120
Both finding friends, because you come here alone.

16
00:00:50,120 --> 00:00:51,240
Or I did it anyway.

17
00:00:51,240 --> 00:00:54,800
Many come without knowing anyone.

18
00:00:54,800 --> 00:01:01,680
Then the introduction becomes a major and important part of finding friends and making a community.

19
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:06,880
- I was divided into my introductory group, where I got to meet lots of lovely friends.

20
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:10,960
Many of them today are my closest friends, which I hang out several days a week.

21
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:12,520
- Fun!
 - Very funny!

22
00:01:12,520 --> 00:01:16,960
But I also got to meet people outside my program who don't plug the same thing.

23
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:18,920
- Same.
 - Which was also very fun.

24
00:01:18,920 --> 00:01:24,400
Everyone was very accommodating and wanted to meet friends, which is very wonderful.

25
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:27,400
- Did you also have the campus walk?
 - Yes!

26
00:01:27,400 --> 00:01:29,240
- Where you have to walk around and see things.

27
00:01:29,240 --> 00:01:33,880
- Learn all the houses and where all the halls are located.

28
00:01:33,880 --> 00:01:37,520
- It was something you felt in the beginning when you walked around and found nowhere.

29
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:39,960
- No.
 - Neither in the city nor here on campus.

30
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:42,760
- There is a lot you can get involved in.

31
00:01:42,760 --> 00:01:47,000
I go to the medical program and then we have something called the Medical Association.

32
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:53,680
Which in turn has many different committees.
 In one of them I have been and still engaged.

33
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:59,880
It is really great fun and promotes student life and the relationship of the program itself.

34
00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:05,400
- I chose to get involved in the Legal Association and it has been great fun.

35
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:09,320
Then you control bales, sessions and trips abroad.

36
00:02:09,320 --> 00:02:12,440
- Go to Åre!
 - Go to Åre!

37
00:02:12,440 --> 00:02:15,160
And go on a ball in other cities, so it has been super fun.

38
00:02:15,160 --> 00:02:18,000
- You choose how committed you want to be.

39
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:22,240
I have probably been the one who has been more involved at least at first.

40
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:27,560
When you just get into student life and are a new student.

41
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:35,840
Then I have also been involved in committees.
 I have been a member of the study social committee.

42
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:41,320
We have arranged lots of different activities for all students in the section.

43
00:02:41,320 --> 00:02:44,120
Among other things, arranged sessions.

44
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:48,360
- I've done a lot actually.
 Engaged me within my section.

45
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:52,400
I study at the School of Economics, then I belong to Sesame.

46
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:53,360
- Correct!
 - It is wonderful!

47
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:58,440
Then I have been involved in everything possible.
 Among other things, have been sitting on the board, very fun.

48
00:02:58,440 --> 00:03:03,800
There are lots of different assignments and committees with different orientations that you can find.

49
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:05,640
There is really everything possible to do.

50
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:08,120
- It's great when creating activities,

51
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:14,720
Because then you meet people from different programs or grades.

52
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:20,520
- Then you can arrange things together between other courses as well.

53
00:03:20,520 --> 00:03:24,800
- Then I have also been involved outside my section, in Örebro Kårhus.

54
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:29,280
- Fun!
 - Which is for students, by students.

55
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:35,520
There I have been an ambassador and helped get people in so they come,

56
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:41,600
And that people work ideally, which is very fun and a good experience.

57
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:47,400
At Örebro Kårhus you can sit in the cafe in the days and plug in and meet people.

58
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:48,120
- Really!

59
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:51,120
- Late in the evenings, on Thursdays there is a Thursday pub.

60
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:55,440
- The music quiz!
 Above all.
 - Music quiz, very fun.

61
00:03:55,440 --> 00:03:59,200
On Fridays we saddle and put on the dance shoes.

62
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:02,960
- Lol!
 - So we go out and party a little.

63
00:04:02,960 --> 00:04:05,960
It is very fun to party with its fellow students.

64
00:04:05,960 --> 00:04:09,200
- Even if you feel uncertainty when you come here.

65
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:14,840
Dare to participate in the introduction is something I actually think everyone should bring,

66
00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:16,160
And do when you come.

67
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:21,080
Because it is a step into Örebro.
 - Yes!

68
00:04:21,080 --> 00:04:24,200
- Both as a city but also at the university.
