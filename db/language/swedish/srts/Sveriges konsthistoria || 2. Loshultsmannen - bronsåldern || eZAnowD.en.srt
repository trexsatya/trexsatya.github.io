1
00:00:06.320 --> 00:00:08.280
Art...

2
00:00:08.440 --> 00:00:11.560
... or weirdness?

3
00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:17.640
Sweden's art history is part of the huge story of our country.

4
00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:21.080
We will with some impacts show art-

5
00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:25.400
- As depicts changes and creation power.

6
00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:47.800
We are in northern Skåne, in Loshult's parish on the border with Småland.

7
00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:51.360
I think it's best to go through.

8
00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:56.280
When the railway connecting Sweden was built over 100 years ago -

9
00:00:56.440 --> 00:00:59.120
- Stone was taken away.

10
00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:03.480
One day, the builders made a remarkable find.

11
00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:12.480
Yes, there ...

12
00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:19.040
Probably it is this, because there are wedged stones here.

13
00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:24.040
There are several who are wedged.

14
00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:29.600
It can be imagined, because here is a hole that they dug out.

15
00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:33.440
It was a Bronze Age find -

16
00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:38.240
- A largest in the country that has been found in one place.

17
00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:42.680
Neck rings, and I can't remember everything.

18
00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:49.560
And so what they call Loshultsmannen.
 Two such, yes.

19
00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:59.720
The Loshultsman is really two old men in a hat.

20
00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:03.920
And are there swimwear they wear?

21
00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:11.360
They are a bit naive in their production method, but they are expressive.

22
00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:19.160
You also see the powerful calves, which go back on the rock carvings.

23
00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:23.840
They have had arms - you have holes after your arms.

24
00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:28.480
They have probably had hands that have worn something.

25
00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:33.840
There is a high likelihood that they have had each cult ax -

26
00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:38.080
- Culture as the cult axes found in the find.

27
00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:43.560
The findings from Loshult are not only made up of the bronze men.

28
00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:47.440
Here are belt plates and shaft hole axes -

29
00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:52.520
- With decor found in southern Europe at this time.

30
00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:58.280
Here is a neck collar, which the women have had around their necks -

31
00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:02.280
-In the 1400s before Christ.

32
00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:06.720
Again, it's the fantastic spiral deck -

33
00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:12.360
- With connected spirals that run along the entire side.

34
00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:18.920
The spirals are something that probably lives in our lice buns today.

35
00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:29.840
The Bronze Age is a time of increasing trade relations and new knowledge.

36
00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:34.720
The alloy of copper and tin - bronze - has a low melting point -

37
00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:39.240
- And can be formed into gear, weapons and ornaments.

38
00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:43.400
Now the image motifs are given three -dimensional form.

39
00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:52.080
They wear hats with the board.

40
00:03:52.240 --> 00:03:59.680
On both sides of the boards there are small holes, probably where horns have been sitting.

41
00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:06.640
It is also a god symbol in almost all of Europe.

42
00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:15.040
If you have horns, you are some kind of religious leader or chief.

43
00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:25.520
It is a mixture of crafts, art and religious symbols.

44
00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:30.000
Probably the old men have stood on a small altar -

45
00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:37.120
- Or at season cult, funerals or other life stages you celebrated.

46
00:04:39.920 --> 00:04:45.240
Yes, a remarkable find.
 One of Sweden's largest, that is.

47
00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:50.560
But was it really the builders at the railway who found the objects?

48
00:04:50.720 --> 00:04:55.440
The land belonged to the potato farmer Mercury-Viktor Svensson.

49
00:04:55.600 --> 00:04:59.560
An old reputation was ...

50
00:04:59.720 --> 00:05:06.160
... that Viktor Svensson found the find two years earlier and hid them there.

51
00:05:06.320 --> 00:05:10.760
But we have no evidence of what it is.

52
00:05:10.920 --> 00:05:16.600
But it is written that it is not the right finding place ...

53
00:05:16.760 --> 00:05:20.440
... where they found this.

54
00:05:20.600 --> 00:05:26.360
It has not been there at all times, but it has been added there and hidden there.

55
00:05:30.560 --> 00:05:33.520
