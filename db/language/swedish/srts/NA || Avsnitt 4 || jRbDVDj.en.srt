1
00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:33.520
No ...!
 Is it true?
 Congratulations!
 How was it, then?

2
00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:40.960
The first time we did it was the lightning and light.
 Absolutely wonderful!

3
00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:46.640
First time with my new guy ...

4
00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:54.240
We were beyond time and space.
 There were only us all over the world.
 Wonderfully!

5
00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:06.360
The first time with Ulf was a bit like ... coffee on the food.

6
00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:11.640
A smooth cup.

7
00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:39.760
It was at a sausage kiosk in Jönköping.
 I ordered a thin bread roll.

8
00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:46.200
I was behind him in the queue.
 Maybe you should ask first ...?

9
00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:49.880
Is it ok if I light a joint?

10
00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:55.160
Is it okay to smoke a little?
 Grass!

11
00:03:55.320 --> 00:04:00.080
I thought we would play TP.

12
00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:05.600
- Then it is more fun to play TP.
 -I do not know...

13
00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:11.440
- It is clear that you should try!
 - Yeah, damn!

14
00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:15.320
I remember Roskilde –92.

15
00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:21.920
Someone in the tent next door had a hash.
 The smoke came straight into our tent.

16
00:04:22.080 --> 00:04:28.480
We got like crazy!
 - Do you remember that, Kristina?

17
00:04:28.640 --> 00:04:32.440
Kristina was completely gone.

18
00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:37.960
We danced naked at the campsite.

19
00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:44.560
- Don't remember that?
 -No.
 We were not together then, Ulf.

20
00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:49.360
You were in Roskilde with that Annika.

21
00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:55.040
-How is it going?
 Do you get the Hulk momentum?
 - The hole.

22
00:05:12.680 --> 00:05:20.160
You see nothing.We have to get closer.
 These are sensitive types.
 Not a sound!

23
00:05:38.120 --> 00:05:41.160
The alarm is howling

24
00:05:51.640 --> 00:05:58.000
There we got a bastard.
 Talk to damn lower case.

25
00:05:58.160 --> 00:06:04.320
We sneak in.
 Don't stand there and look stupid.
 Come now!

26
00:06:06.440 --> 00:06:12.480
A little fluffy music so we get in the right mood?

27
00:06:12.640 --> 00:06:18.560
Put something with him ... what is his name?
 Bob Marley!
 La - la - la ...

28
00:06:18.720 --> 00:06:23.520
This one is absolutely perfect!

29
00:06:25.680 --> 00:06:33.360
- Do you have to be in Amsterdam?
 -Oh God...!
 We were in a coffee shop.

30
00:06:33.520 --> 00:06:39.800
- Coffee they don't know what it is.
 - So you have tried ...?

31
00:06:39.960 --> 00:06:46.600
No, we never went in.
 We turned.
 Otherwise, we would have become high as ...

32
00:06:46.760 --> 00:06:53.440
You were another person at that time.
 Young and stupid.

33
00:07:59.920 --> 00:08:03.680
What 'damn is this?!

34
00:08:03.840 --> 00:08:09.800
I have been blown.
 This is tea, for damn.

35
00:08:09.960 --> 00:08:13.600
This is not grass!

36
00:08:18.560 --> 00:08:21.560
Coffee?

37
00:08:32.560 --> 00:08:38.800
Now we will round off.
 We thank Liselott with an applause.

38
00:08:40.120 --> 00:08:45.760
It has been fun to teach the flower language.

39
00:08:45.920 --> 00:08:49.760
Now use the new knowledge.

40
00:08:49.920 --> 00:08:56.040
As a farewell gift you get an Alstroemeria from me.

41
00:08:56.200 --> 00:09:02.520
Does anyone remember what it means in the flower language?

42
00:09:02.680 --> 00:09:08.080
It means "I wish you happiness and prosperity".

43
00:09:08.240 --> 00:09:14.200
Does anyone have a flower to me?
 Thanks.
 A pimpinella!

44
00:09:14.360 --> 00:09:22.080
- What do you want to say with it?
 - I am naked and vulnerable.

45
00:09:23.520 --> 00:09:28.640
Well ... - Jim, do you have a flower for me?

46
00:09:31.880 --> 00:09:38.600
Thank you.
 A lemon balm!
 Is anyone remembering what it means?

47
00:09:41.560 --> 00:09:45.480
No.
 We look in our compendiums.

48
00:09:45.640 --> 00:09:51.280
It means "I want to enjoy your body".

49
00:09:51.440 --> 00:09:56.200
Was that what you wanted to say, Jim?

50
00:09:56.360 --> 00:10:00.760
No.
 You just took a flower at random.

51
00:10:00.920 --> 00:10:05.560
I leave you with a poem by Edith Södergran.

52
00:10:05.720 --> 00:10:09.360
I am the last flower of the autumn

53
00:10:09.520 --> 00:10:16.280
I have seen the autumn's star worlds, I have seen light from warm hearths

54
00:10:16.440 --> 00:10:23.000
It is so easy to follow the same path I am the last flower of the autumn ...

55
00:10:26.600 --> 00:10:30.600
Jim is feeling bad.
 He ate up a crocus.

56
00:11:04.680 --> 00:11:09.920
- Here we sit and wait for the bus.
 -Yes.

57
00:11:11.240 --> 00:11:15.360
It is 08:36.

58
00:11:15.520 --> 00:11:19.360
08:41 it will come.

59
00:11:19.520 --> 00:11:23.960
Then we have a little while together.

60
00:11:25.760 --> 00:11:29.960
You… when you sit with your legs at cross-

61
00:11:30.120 --> 00:11:36.360
- Can not happen that you squeeze "the little" ...

62
00:11:36.520 --> 00:11:40.960
... and the little bag that is under?

63
00:11:41.120 --> 00:11:46.960
–Wa?
 - The little bag with the little balls.

64
00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:52.840
They can also be squeezed.

65
00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:59.040
But maybe he is not small, but big?

66
00:12:04.280 --> 00:12:09.880
-What are you talking about?
 - It may be big.

67
00:12:10.040 --> 00:12:15.760
- You are sick!
 - So you don't talk!

68
00:12:15.920 --> 00:12:19.760
So you don't tell a lady!

69
00:12:20.920 --> 00:12:27.520
Lasse, I know what you are doing!
 Who is this blonde Siamese?

70
00:12:30.040 --> 00:12:33.040
Can't you answer, Lasse?!

71
00:12:46.080 --> 00:12:50.840
Should we drink coffee during the meeting -

72
00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:56.880
- Or should we take a break and drink coffee then?

73
00:12:57.040 --> 00:13:01.080
We take the meeting first and the coffee later.

74
00:13:01.240 --> 00:13:06.560
- Should we say so?
 -Yes.

75
00:13:06.720 --> 00:13:11.120
Paragraph 1 on the agenda:

76
00:13:11.280 --> 00:13:14.680
Farm cleaning ...

77
00:13:14.840 --> 00:13:21.480
Can't you get a little cup of coffee during the meeting?
 I get so hungry!

78
00:13:21.640 --> 00:13:27.440
We have decided to have the meeting first.

79
00:13:27.600 --> 00:13:31.800
I am waiting for after the meeting.

80
00:13:31.960 --> 00:13:39.800
- I have Marianne on my speaker list.
 - The resting can have a cup of coffee anyway.

81
00:13:39.960 --> 00:13:43.920
How should we do now?

82
00:13:44.080 --> 00:13:49.720
-I am waiting.
 - There are buns and fruits too.

83
00:13:49.880 --> 00:13:54.880
-I am waiting.
 -Okay.
 - Be so good, Marianne.

84
00:13:55.040 --> 00:13:58.880
The farm cleaning is neglected ...

85
00:13:59.040 --> 00:14:03.000
May I take a small banana?

86
00:14:06.880 --> 00:14:11.440
We have decided to take the meeting first.

87
00:14:14.480 --> 00:14:17.800
The farm cleaning has been extremely ...

88
00:14:17.960 --> 00:14:22.280
Vilgot may take a banana if he wants to.

89
00:14:23.600 --> 00:14:27.400
Vilgot - a replica on this.

90
00:14:29.280 --> 00:14:32.920
A banana would be good.

91
00:14:33.080 --> 00:14:38.800
Should we decide that Vilgot may take a banana?

92
00:14:38.960 --> 00:14:45.760
Yes!
 I record this - that Vilgot takes a banana.

93
00:15:44.640 --> 00:15:48.240
I'm not going to take anymore now.

94
00:15:48.400 --> 00:15:55.200
- Don't you have a cup of coffee?
 - No now, Gunnel!
 After the meeting.

95
00:15:56.440 --> 00:16:01.280
- Can I continue now, Torsten?
 -Yes.

96
00:16:01.440 --> 00:16:08.760
We must decide whether to buy new outdoor furniture and how much they may cost

97
00:16:08.920 --> 00:16:14.360
It's no idea.
 No one listens to me.

98
00:16:14.520 --> 00:16:19.920
-I'm listening to you.
 - I also listen.

99
00:16:20.080 --> 00:16:26.160
- No, you don't listen!
 - See your bun, Vilgot.

100
00:16:26.320 --> 00:16:32.280
Let's return to the meeting now.
 - Continue, Marianne.

101
00:16:34.920 --> 00:16:41.760
- Jysk Bäddlager's website has ... –Oj!
 Now it is half past eight.

102
00:16:41.920 --> 00:16:48.880
Time runs away.
 I explain the meeting ended ... Yes, Marianne?

103
00:16:49.040 --> 00:16:55.280
In any case, we must determine time for a new meeting.

104
00:16:55.440 --> 00:17:02.520
We decide on a new date and then we drink coffee later.

105
00:17:02.680 --> 00:17:09.360
Or should we drink coffee first and make the decision after that?

106
00:17:29.440 --> 00:17:33.520
Nämen Lasse, you must not smoke here!

107
00:17:36.400 --> 00:17:41.200
-Is it true?
 -I promise.

108
00:17:41.360 --> 00:17:45.000
Can I order?

109
00:17:47.440 --> 00:17:51.080
CAN I ORDER?

110
00:17:56.640 --> 00:18:02.120
Would you like to adopt?

111
00:18:02.280 --> 00:18:08.040
I do not know.
 But ... yes, of course.

112
00:18:08.200 --> 00:18:12.200
If you can't have children, so ...

113
00:18:12.360 --> 00:18:18.880
Would you adopt from Sweden or from another country?

114
00:18:19.040 --> 00:18:24.680
Yes ... I don't know.
 God, what a hard time!

115
00:18:27.120 --> 00:18:33.520
But it does not matter.
 It's a child you want.
 And you?

116
00:18:33.680 --> 00:18:37.320
I would adopt a potter.

117
00:18:39.080 --> 00:18:44.560
–Wa?
 - A potter from Österlen.

118
00:18:44.720 --> 00:18:49.280
-What then?
 An adult ...?
 -Yes.

119
00:18:49.440 --> 00:18:56.800
She is to be called Margareta.
 She will make small ceramic bowls with dots on.

120
00:18:56.960 --> 00:19:02.360
-Why?
 - I like dots.

121
00:19:02.520 --> 00:19:07.160
But why should you adopt an adult?

122
00:19:07.320 --> 00:19:13.400
- Because I like her.
 - But she doesn't exist.

123
00:19:13.560 --> 00:19:20.000
You've only found her.
 And you don't adopt adults!

124
00:19:20.160 --> 00:19:24.000
No, but you can dream?

125
00:19:41.600 --> 00:19:48.120
-How is it at work?
 -I'm tired of it.

126
00:19:48.280 --> 00:19:55.440
I'm thinking of resigning.
 Start your own, move abroad ...

127
00:19:55.600 --> 00:20:02.960
- I want to go to Syria.
 - Yeah?
 What will you do there?

128
00:20:03.120 --> 00:20:10.800
Flags.
 There is a damn potential in flags down there now.

129
00:20:10.960 --> 00:20:18.040
They burn American flags every day.
 It goes to a damn mass.

130
00:20:18.200 --> 00:20:25.120
You should move to the Middle East and sell American flags?
 Brilliant.

131
00:20:25.280 --> 00:20:32.200
Yes.
 But Kristina is so negative.
 "There is no public dental care in Syria."

132
00:20:32.360 --> 00:20:36.000
But the last word is not said yet.

133
00:20:36.160 --> 00:20:40.160
Maybe she's afraid to move there?

134
00:20:40.320 --> 00:20:46.960
But what is she afraid of?
 Women are a mystery.

135
00:21:01.120 --> 00:21:07.960
- We kick off the conference.
 - I thought we would be more.

136
00:21:08.120 --> 00:21:11.680
It just becomes you and I today.

137
00:21:11.840 --> 00:21:18.640
We will look at the results of a fresh survey.

138
00:21:18.800 --> 00:21:22.800
What does our skills profile look like?

139
00:21:22.960 --> 00:21:29.320
I want to say that we have many competent employees.

140
00:21:29.480 --> 00:21:35.640
But you are a disappointment, however, you, Tord.
 "Stupid like a log."

141
00:21:37.240 --> 00:21:44.080
What is it?
 I asked the following question to all employees:

142
00:21:44.240 --> 00:21:49.320
"Who is the stupid - Tord or a donkey?"

143
00:21:49.480 --> 00:21:55.320
The result is striking.
 There is not much to talk about.

144
00:21:55.480 --> 00:22:01.560
- Is this fresh figures?
 -Yes.
 Now we will change the subject.

145
00:22:01.720 --> 00:22:06.840
We will talk about our indoor environment in the office.

146
00:22:07.000 --> 00:22:11.240
How is the air in the office really?

147
00:22:11.400 --> 00:22:18.440
We had a pretty good air - until you started, Tord.

148
00:22:18.600 --> 00:22:23.440
The air is basically unbearable today.

149
00:22:43.600 --> 00:22:49.520
- It was!
 - I would like to push in one thing ...

150
00:22:49.680 --> 00:22:53.840
I brought an information movie with me.

151
00:23:09.680 --> 00:23:16.320
The earth is a wonderful place, where we can live in harmony with nature.

152
00:23:16.480 --> 00:23:23.320
But in order to get there, we have to deal with a problem that can ruin everything

153
00:23:30.120 --> 00:23:33.920
Evil has many faces.

154
00:23:35.960 --> 00:23:39.960
The problem with Paul is growing more and more.

155
00:23:40.120 --> 00:23:45.960
I asked the prime minister what he thinks about Paul.

156
00:23:46.120 --> 00:23:50.160
How would you describe Paul?

157
00:23:50.320 --> 00:23:53.320
Tycoon.

158
00:23:53.480 --> 00:23:57.800
Drive with people, do not listen to others.

159
00:24:00.280 --> 00:24:03.280
Unpleasant.

160
00:24:03.440 --> 00:24:08.920
- Do you find that Paul is cash?
 -Maybe a bit.

161
00:24:09.080 --> 00:24:13.920
- Do you find that he is good looking?
 -No!

162
00:24:14.080 --> 00:24:17.560
If you compare me to Paul ...

163
00:24:17.720 --> 00:24:23.320
From the most beautiful beautiful to the ugliest ugly.

164
00:24:23.480 --> 00:24:27.520
What are you filming, Tord?

165
00:24:52.080 --> 00:24:59.000
I want us to talk about one thing now.
 It is important to me.
 Now, now, now!

166
00:25:01.560 --> 00:25:05.040
What should we talk about?

167
00:25:05.200 --> 00:25:10.560
-Do we have to?
 -Yes.
 You talk better then.

168
00:25:10.720 --> 00:25:16.360
-Hello Hello!
 - Don't larger yourself!

169
00:25:17.640 --> 00:25:25.280
- Mid heart has broken.
 - Does it feel like that, Barbie?
 Why?

170
00:25:25.440 --> 00:25:29.280
You don't love me anymore.

171
00:25:29.440 --> 00:25:35.440
I love you, Barbie.
 Oh, what I love you!
 Kiss!

172
00:25:35.600 --> 00:25:40.000
Not like that!
 I do not believe you.

173
00:25:41.720 --> 00:25:45.520
Why don't you believe me?
 What has ...

174
00:25:45.680 --> 00:25:52.360
- Why don't you believe me?
 - The front, maybe.
 But not anymore.

175
00:25:52.520 --> 00:25:58.080
-In order to?
 - The birthday present was so boring!

176
00:25:58.240 --> 00:26:02.040
It was six months ago!

177
00:26:02.200 --> 00:26:07.840
I haven't been able to pick it up before.
 I have been ashamed!

178
00:26:08.000 --> 00:26:12.480
I got a pair of long -distance skates!

179
00:26:12.640 --> 00:26:17.280
You said I got to buy what I wanted

180
00:26:17.440 --> 00:26:24.120
- Yes, but not a pair of skates!
 –And what did I get when I turned 30?

181
00:26:24.280 --> 00:26:27.840
I got two packages of ice cream boats.

182
00:26:28.000 --> 00:26:34.840
The year before I got a dish brush, the year before a baskets ...

183
00:26:35.000 --> 00:26:38.840
Can't we swim in the swimming pool?

184
00:26:39.000 --> 00:26:44.320
... and the year before I got lunch vouchers.

185
00:27:16.120 --> 00:27:22.000
Before we part, we should lighten the mood a bit.

186
00:27:22.160 --> 00:27:29.160
I have invited a very popular comedian here - Pontus Enhörning!

187
00:27:35.040 --> 00:27:39.240
Are you Tord?
 Oh, you were ugly!

188
00:27:39.400 --> 00:27:46.800
And what you smell!
 And the mustaches look like laces that have run out of your nose!

189
00:27:46.960 --> 00:27:51.200
Haven't you got fuck yet, Tord?
