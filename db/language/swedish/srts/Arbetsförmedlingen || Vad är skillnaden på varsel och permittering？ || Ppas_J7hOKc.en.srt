00:00:07.720 --> 00:00:15.300
Hello and welcome to this extra posted broadcast on the occasion of the great notice that is happening right now.

2
00:00:15.300 --> 00:00:23.220
Yes, the Coronavirus affects the labor market very heavy and many companies unfortunately have to notify or leave their employees.

3
00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:30.920
Today I have Annika SundÃ©n, Head of Analysis, and Mats Rubertson, qualified manager here at the Employment Service.

4
00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:33.460
You are warmly welcomed here.

5
00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:33.960
Thanks so much.

6
00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:42.680
I thought we might start by sorting out what warning actually means.
 Annika, what does it mean to be notified today

7
00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:47.620
A notice is that it is a company that tells its employees

8
00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:53.580
That we expect we will not be able to have work tasks for you so that you can be dismissed.

9
00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:57.860
So it is a notification that it may happen.

10
00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:03.280
And this is because of the fact that as a result of the Coronavirus

11
00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:06.080
So we live our lives in a different way.

12
00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:09.500
We do not go to a restaurant, we do not travel, we shop less.

13
00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:13.040
And then there are many companies that no longer

14
00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:17.640
yes cafes close, airlines no longer fly,

15
00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:20.860
There will be smaller people in the business and then there are no work tasks anymore.

16
00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:28.160
And Mats Lost is a fairly new concept for many, how would you explain what it means

17
00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:32.280
Leave Leave is an opportunity for employers that

18
00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:38.180
let the employees instead of resigning them go down in working hours

19
00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:45.340
And it is for the same reason as a result of the fact that there are fewer tasks to perform really.

20
00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:48.420
So it is an opportunity to go down in working hours.

21
00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:52.140
And what with layoffs right now is that this

22
00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:54.840
is a crisis that we know will end.

23
00:01:54.900 --> 00:01:57.660
It is a virus that will disappear

24
00:01:57.760 --> 00:01:59.660
And then the companies want

25
00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:07.340
What is important is that the companies remain when this has blown over or when the virus does not exist

26
00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:13.000
And therefore it can be good for a company to permit to be able to keep its employees,

27
00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:16.420
To be able to start then when the wheels start rolling again.

28
00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:21.420
Luminals are something that has always existed and

29
00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:25.100
that is an agreement between employers and employee organizations

30
00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:29.860
And now there is also the possibility of short -term work

31
00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:33.840
which is handled by the Growth Agency that makes it more advantageous

32
00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:38.360
for employers to use the instrument layoff.

33
00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:42.340
Yes there is a difference between notice and layoffs.

34
00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:47.940
What does the situation look like right now Annika have any statistics, how many are it that is notified?

35
00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:53.760
Normally if we should only have a comparison a normal month if we take Mars a year ago

36
00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:58.440
Then we had about 3000 people who were notified of dismissal.

37
00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:08.400
During these last two weeks, we have 18,400 people who have been notified of termination.

38
00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:12.060
And just last week there were 14,000 people almost.

39
00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:18.180
So there are very big numbers, so there are very many people affected by this.

40
00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:25.680
If we look back on previous crises, I think mainly in 2008 when the great economic crisis came last.

41
00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:30.340
How many people are notified will eventually be dismissed

42
00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:35.300
Yes it is important to remember to be notified does not mean getting rid of the job

43
00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:37.720
This means that you can lose the job.

44
00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:42.380
If we look at the financial crisis in 2008 then by those who were notified then

45
00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:47.660
It was six out of ten who were then dismissed from their job.

46
00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:52.040
But these were people who found new jobs pretty quickly so in the end

47
00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:55.660
So there were three out of ten who became unemployed.

48
00:03:56.280 --> 00:03:59.720
So it's not that you go directly into long -term unemployment

49
00:03:59.720 --> 00:04:02.760
Just because you have been notified, been dismissed, or not been terminated.

50
00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:07.620
After all, we have arrived until the Coronavirus had a good labor market

51
00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:12.160
And there have been plenty of jobs if you have at least one high school education.

52
00:04:13.320 --> 00:04:20.500
And these people who can now get rid of their jobs are people who have had experience

53
00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:24.280
and that has worked so they are quite close and have pretty good opportunities

54
00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:27.440
that when the economy then starts getting started again

55
00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:31.100
When we start living in our usual way,

56
00:04:31.100 --> 00:04:37.980
When we start going out again at a restaurant, shopping and traveling, these people will be able to get new jobs.

57
00:04:37.980 --> 00:04:41.520
And which industries and sectors do we see the most notice in

58
00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:45.940
We have gone into it a bit before, care is one of them for example.

59
00:04:45.940 --> 00:04:47.940
No care is not.

60
00:04:47.940 --> 00:04:49.940
Sorry, hotel and restaurant

61
00:04:49.940 --> 00:04:54.820
Yes about half of the warnings are located in hotels and restaurant

62
00:04:54.820 --> 00:04:56.820
And this is where they have come first.

63
00:04:56.820 --> 00:05:04.580
But we also see it in staffing companies, travel companies, in the transport sector and in the trade.

64
00:05:04.580 --> 00:05:06.580
If we take care and care as you mentioned

65
00:05:06.580 --> 00:05:10.540
so it is a sector where there is a very high demand

66
00:05:10.540 --> 00:05:14.880
And a lot of people are needed in sick and health care and care right now.

67
00:05:14.880 --> 00:05:19.480
We have seen that more job ads have been received for those jobs.

68
00:05:19.480 --> 00:05:24.840
So one thing to think about right now is that if there is something one would like to do in the future

69
00:05:24.840 --> 00:05:26.840
which you can now educate.

70
00:05:26.840 --> 00:05:31.120
After all, there is a great need in care and care.
 So to start thinking about an education within it.

71
00:05:31.120 --> 00:05:33.120
Yes a great point there.

72
00:05:33.820 --> 00:05:40.000
Mats, layoffs we have to go back to it.
 Are there any figures on what it looks like with layoffs

73
00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:44.060
The layers have 500650 pieces?

74
00:05:44.060 --> 00:05:49.980
Yes 650 pieces, there are not so many yet but we expect many more.

75
00:05:49.980 --> 00:05:55.660
After all, it is the Swedish Growth Agency that will register them.
 It will be done from April seventh.

76
00:05:55.660 --> 00:06:00.700
Are there any specific sectors where we believe the layoffs may increase

77
00:06:00.700 --> 00:06:06.600
One can imagine laying out of layouts can be something that appeals to industries

78
00:06:06.600 --> 00:06:10.640
or knowledge -intensive companies to a greater extent

79
00:06:13.080 --> 00:06:22.720
Where it is more advantageous to get people back to work fast.

80
00:06:24.560 --> 00:06:28.340
Yes this is important, as I said a health crisis

81
00:06:28.340 --> 00:06:31.020
Where this virus will eventually disappear.

82
00:06:31.020 --> 00:06:36.800
We do not know exactly when it is, but then it is important that these companies remain.

83
00:06:38.940 --> 00:06:43.340
The reason why layoffs have not been common in the past is that the companies themselves have been responsible for the cost.

84
00:06:43.340 --> 00:06:47.320
Now the government has entered with powerful efforts

85
00:06:47.320 --> 00:06:53.080
where one then goes in and helps pay the salaries of employees in order for them to be left

86
00:06:53.080 --> 00:06:55.080
And that companies should be able to live on.

87
00:06:55.080 --> 00:06:59.780
So it's a lot about keeping the economy or these companies up

88
00:07:01.020 --> 00:07:05.240
So that they are there and left that we can get started when this virus is gone.

89
00:07:05.240 --> 00:07:08.540
So traditionally, we have not seen so much layoffs

90
00:07:08.880 --> 00:07:13.640
But it has started to increase now, which shows that it is an extraordinary situation we are facing.

91
00:07:13.640 --> 00:07:15.640
Yes you could say that.

92
00:07:17.660 --> 00:07:21.540
And finally.
 If you are now faced with being notified.

93
00:07:21.560 --> 00:07:25.420
Do you have any tips on what to take with you already and start thinking about

94
00:07:26.360 --> 00:07:30.400
One thing to keep in mind is that many who also lose the job and not just be notified

95
00:07:30.400 --> 00:07:33.160
are, after all, hourly employees and have had fixed -term employment.

96
00:07:33.160 --> 00:07:37.100
Many of these industries are input industries so there are many young people

97
00:07:37.100 --> 00:07:39.100
Many who are at the beginning of their working life.

98
00:07:39.960 --> 00:07:43.220
This might be a time to think about if I might be educated

99
00:07:43.220 --> 00:07:45.840
I might take advantage of this time to find an education

100
00:07:47.020 --> 00:07:49.220
But also think about what can I do now in the short term

101
00:07:49.440 --> 00:07:54.440
For example, I saw that the Sophia home begins a very short education in three days

102
00:07:54.440 --> 00:07:59.140
To learn the basics to help in sickness and health care, for example in the kitchen.

103
00:08:00.140 --> 00:08:02.800
So to think about change.

104
00:08:02.800 --> 00:08:05.620
Then there are many services on the Employment Service's website

105
00:08:05.620 --> 00:08:10.020
Our digital services where you can get tips on how to think.

106
00:08:11.200 --> 00:08:13.200
Yes, you can create a profile.

107
00:08:13.200 --> 00:08:16.080
Yes create a profile and get ready.

108
00:08:16.080 --> 00:08:18.080
And then you become visible too

109
00:08:18.080 --> 00:08:24.300
For employers and get a faster contact where you are looking for skills for example.

110
00:08:24.300 --> 00:08:27.760
But it is only when you become unemployed that you have to sign up

111
00:08:27.820 --> 00:08:29.820
So you should not do that now that you are notified.

112
00:08:29.820 --> 00:08:32.360
But please take part in our digital services

113
00:08:32.460 --> 00:08:37.220
And other webinars to get tips on how the labor market works and what you can think of.

114
00:08:37.620 --> 00:08:46.780
And then it is important to write in digitally, it makes a lot easier.
 We must say that.

115
00:08:47.500 --> 00:08:49.500
It was all the time we had for today.

116
00:08:49.500 --> 00:08:54.380
I have to thank you for coming here and I thank you who sat and watched.

117
00:08:54.380 --> 00:08:55.440
Bye.
