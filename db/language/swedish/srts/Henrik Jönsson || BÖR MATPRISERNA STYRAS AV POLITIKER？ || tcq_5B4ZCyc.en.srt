1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.180
With us it becomes porridge for the whole family.
 And sandwiches with brass butter and liver pie.

2
00:00:05.180 --> 00:00:14.080
Food prices are shining and now more and more people demand that the government stop the price increases.

3
00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:17.280
Porridge, mutton, file.

4
00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:23.160
Why do food prices rise more in Sweden than in the other Nordic countries

5
00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:26.040
Milk chocolate or egg breakfast.

6
00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:37.040
Can politicians really control food prices and what happens to an economy that puts the market out of play?

7
00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:43.840
I address these questions in this week's video about "food prices".

8
00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:47.640
A real nutritional breakfast.
 It sounds awkward.

9
00:00:50.800 --> 00:01:00.160
For quick comments and clips, I ask you not to forget to follow my new Youtube channel "Henrik in brief" above

10
00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:08.760
And if you appreciate my movies, you will help me to continue to make them if you support me through any of the payment options below.

11
00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:20.060
It is only thanks to your generous and voluntary support that I can continue this work so a big big thank you to all of you who contribute!

12
00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:28.960
Today I talk about politics, money and price control.
 Come along!

13
00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:46.040
I have a plan.

14
00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:55.240
The character "Sickan" in the filmed crime game "Jönssonligan" always has a plan.

15
00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:58.580
It is a brilliant plan Sickan, brilliant.

16
00:01:58.580 --> 00:02:09.580
As with all grandiose plans, however, the league's hopes tend to be shattered, with all kinds of drops as a consequence.

17
00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:24.260
Significantly less dull, but the more disastrous, however, all the history of history has been found to be the social economy.

18
00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:32.640
From the totalitarian plan economies of the iron curtain to Venezuela's populist self -mutilation policy

19
00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:45.740
All attempts at state control of the economy have endlessly ended in rationing, poverty and economic collapse.

20
00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:53.740
It is therefore alarming that the war economy's swelling waves have now again given rise to populist requirements

21
00:02:53.740 --> 00:03:00.240
on exactly this type of economic self -destructiveness in Sweden.

22
00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:06.740
However, it is easy to understand the reason why these extreme ideas are again discussed,

23
00:03:06.740 --> 00:03:14.440
For both inflation and higher prices, households are currently hitting all households across Europe.

24
00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:25.440
Milk and eggs with 31 percent, bread with 20 percent, vegetables with 18.5 percent and meat with 17.5 percent.

25
00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:35.540
At the same time, food prices are rising faster than inflation, and is also slightly higher in Sweden than in our neighboring countries.

26
00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:41.740
And we have high inflation, but food prices have risen almost twice as much.

27
00:03:41.740 --> 00:03:51.740
This situation now leads conspiratorial socialists to the conclusion that Sweden's food market is a dysfunctional oligopoly

28
00:03:51.740 --> 00:03:56.440
that must be regulated for the good of the public.

29
00:03:56.440 --> 00:04:05.940
Three players who in practice pricing and it is something that has very bad effects for ordinary families with children.

30
00:04:05.940 --> 00:04:13.040
The Swedish grocery store is thus dominated by three major players, it is ICA, Coop and Axfood.

31
00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:18.640
A so -called oligopoly market, ie three companies own 90 percent of the market.

32
00:04:18.640 --> 00:04:26.420
The Left Party imagines that these perceived problems should be corrected by threatening political regulation

33
00:04:26.420 --> 00:04:30.220
force price controls on food.

34
00:04:30.220 --> 00:04:37.480
If you think you tell these actors that if we do not get an agreement,

35
00:04:37.480 --> 00:04:40.460
Then we are prepared to act politically in different ways.

36
00:04:40.460 --> 00:04:47.220
It indicates well that you need to take them into a room or context to talk to them

37
00:04:47.220 --> 00:04:51.620
and discuss how to hold on to these price increases

38
00:04:51.620 --> 00:05:00.520
This procedure is supposed to be able to help the people, fight an unhealthy market and push back inflation

39
00:05:00.520 --> 00:05:06.120
in a single hyper -efficient socialist Alexander chop.

40
00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:13.220
The fact that we are higher than many comparable countries depends on the situation we have right now in Sweden.

41
00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:19.200
And then we have a government in Sweden that could act but who chooses not to.

42
00:05:19.200 --> 00:05:26.000
Pressing food prices it is a very important way to push down inflation broadly.

43
00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:33.400
This audience -free faith is met by Finance Minister Elisabeth Svantesson with the argument that

44
00:05:33.400 --> 00:05:39.600
"Praise ceiling creates a shortage of deficiencies arising when you have a prize roof."

45
00:05:39.640 --> 00:05:48.480
Therefore, two things, pristakers do not solve the problem of inflation as a basis.
 The second is that when you put a price ceiling, a shortage arises.

46
00:05:48.480 --> 00:05:52.280
Why does a deficiency arise - it does that when you have a prize roof.

47
00:05:52.280 --> 00:05:59.680
Compared to the Left Party's plan -economic radicalism, unfortunately

48
00:05:59.680 --> 00:06:04.980
Like a slaughtered growth curve in the planning economy blown.

49
00:06:04.980 --> 00:06:10.980
We propose a concrete entrance to relate to a concrete market.

50
00:06:10.980 --> 00:06:19.580
It becomes very problematic to set the idea of markets against the reality that prevails.

51
00:06:19.580 --> 00:06:27.280
Despite the fact that the regulatory universal solution may appear solidarity with household's immediate needs,

52
00:06:27.280 --> 00:06:36.180
In fact, this type of simple solutions to complex problems is the very definition of populism.

53
00:06:36.180 --> 00:06:43.280
Therefore, let me point by point explain the real reasons for Sweden's price problems

54
00:06:43.280 --> 00:06:52.780
And why the Left Party's solutions would only make everything worse for everyone.

55
00:06:59.180 --> 00:07:06.760
Food prices in Sweden have increased than the throughout in the EU and more than our Nordic neighboring countries.

56
00:07:06.800 --> 00:07:12.880
It is true that Sweden's food prices have risen slightly more than in the other Nordic countries.

57
00:07:12.880 --> 00:07:20.280
However, the Left Party interprets this difference as that Sweden would have a unique dysfunctional food market

58
00:07:20.280 --> 00:07:25.280
which can only be corrected by state regulations.

59
00:07:37.600 --> 00:07:45.700
This is actually a double error.
 Because in fact, the Nordic countries' food markets are very similar.

60
00:07:45.700 --> 00:07:52.200
In fact, as recently as two years ago, Norway was investigated for cartel formation.

61
00:07:52.200 --> 00:07:59.600
Thus, there is no big difference in the Nordic markets that would explain Sweden's higher food prices

62
00:07:59.600 --> 00:08:07.000
Although a lush and more competitive food market would of course be desirable throughout the Nordic region.

63
00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:17.700
However, such a competitive development is counteracted by price regulations, which instead cement the current appearance of the market

64
00:08:17.700 --> 00:08:25.700
Through politically forced framework agreements that raise the market entry cost for new players.

65
00:08:25.700 --> 00:08:36.100
The real reasons for Sweden's slightly higher food price costs are actually politically distorted by the left government.

66
00:08:36.100 --> 00:08:45.000
But we will start tonight with food prices.
 In one year, they have increased by almost 20%.

67
00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:50.300
The price increase measure that Agenda refers to in this clip is the CPI

68
00:08:50.300 --> 00:08:58.000
Thus, the "consumer price index" that measures prices that Sweden's consumers actually pay.

69
00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:08.400
Already a year ago, Statistics Sweden warned that the consumer price index rose as a result of increased energy and fuel prices.

70
00:09:08.400 --> 00:09:17.300
“The high energy prices not only affect the CPI directly.
 They will also drive up other prices in society.
 [...]

71
00:09:17.300 --> 00:09:26.800
Producers such as farmers, taxi companies and car manufacturers meet all higher purchase prices for their input goods and transport.

72
00:09:26.800 --> 00:09:33.000
To preserve their margins, these in turn need to raise prices for their products.

73
00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:39.200
This is usually called an indirect effect of price increases on input goods. "

74
00:09:39.200 --> 00:09:47.680
Although CPI is largely affected by the international situation, Swedish decisions also have, for example

75
00:09:47.680 --> 00:09:55.980
Raising the reduction obligation for fuel and the forced nuclear closures expensive Sweden's domestic production.

76
00:09:55.980 --> 00:10:04.160
For several years, the agricultural sector has warned that Sweden's uniquely high reduction obligation would lead to expensive and even

77
00:10:04.160 --> 00:10:09.760
Settlement of Swedish agriculture and according to the research company Energiforsk

78
00:10:09.760 --> 00:10:15.660
Had Swedish energy prices been between 30 and 50 percent lower

79
00:10:15.660 --> 00:10:23.060
if the left government had not forced a settlement of four nuclear reactors in southern Sweden.

80
00:10:23.060 --> 00:10:30.760
In addition, the Swedish krona falls as a result of Sweden's uniquely low productivity.

81
00:10:30.760 --> 00:10:39.960
Sweden's economy is going the worst throughout the EU and it is the only country where growth backs and ends up at minus.

82
00:10:39.960 --> 00:10:51.260
… And this economic jumbop placement is in turn a result of both an careless monetary policy and unbudged integration costs.

83
00:10:51.260 --> 00:10:59.860
Thus, it is not a capitalist conspiracy that is behind Sweden's comparatively larger food price increases

84
00:10:59.860 --> 00:11:15.360
Without the fact that Sweden's left -wing government consciously carried out a policy that expensive both domestic production and imported goods.

85
00:11:15.360 --> 00:11:21.040
In the rear view mirror this can be described as the trinity of the "regulatory stupidity",

86
00:11:21.040 --> 00:11:27.840
Where power -hungry Social Democrats first became dependent on regulatory environmental parties,

87
00:11:27.840 --> 00:11:37.640
which together then regulated higher energy prices whose consequences The Left Party now wants to handle with price regulations.

88
00:11:37.640 --> 00:11:43.960
This strategy is like first drilling holes in the boat, then blaming the crew for sinking,

89
00:11:43.960 --> 00:11:50.760
And with the nose over the water finally requires a ban on drowning accidents.

90
00:11:50.760 --> 00:11:58.320
To try to regulate regulations with more regulations in this way in an almost poetic manner

91
00:11:58.320 --> 00:12:03.920
The unmatched path of socialism towards societal collapse.

92
00:12:03.920 --> 00:12:11.020
I will now explain exactly how this goes in ten simple steps

93
00:12:17.460 --> 00:12:28.860
In a free market, the price of a product is regulated by supply and demand.
 If many want to buy a certain item rises its price

94
00:12:28.860 --> 00:12:37.760
But great demand also stimulates the production of the product, until supply and demand is in balance.

95
00:12:37.760 --> 00:12:47.260
If a politician for price control of a commodity it becomes impossible for supply and demand to balanced

96
00:12:47.260 --> 00:12:57.960
Because this tells the producer: "If you can't produce this to be cheaper than this, it must not be sold."

97
00:12:57.960 --> 00:13:10.760
This means that less is produced by the product, even though demand continues to increase.
 Price regulation has now created a deficiency.

98
00:13:10.760 --> 00:13:21.160
In order to compensate for the deficiency created by price regulation, the state is now beginning to subsidize the production of the product.

99
00:13:21.160 --> 00:13:32.100
This, in turn, knocks out other producers of the product, who cannot compete with the state's tax subsidized production.

100
00:13:32.100 --> 00:13:38.900
Now the state's forecasts and tax capital control all production of the product,

101
00:13:38.900 --> 00:13:53.200
But because the pattern of consumption is irregular, unpredictable over and deficits, which means both queues and waste.

102
00:13:53.200 --> 00:14:04.500
In order to balance this unpredictability, people begin to hoard the goods, and black markets arise beyond the control of the state.

103
00:14:04.500 --> 00:14:10.400
As a result of the growing black market, the social economy begins to stagnate,

104
00:14:10.400 --> 00:14:21.100
And the state must invest more resources in both the price -regulated product and on fighting the black markets.

105
00:14:21.100 --> 00:14:30.900
The state's cost to manufacture the goods is therefore constantly rising, while the regulated price is firm.

106
00:14:30.900 --> 00:14:36.500
This leads to the entire economy starting to collapse.

107
00:14:36.500 --> 00:14:43.600
Due to the price regulation, the state's costs for the production of the product are now unsustainable,

108
00:14:43.600 --> 00:14:49.800
And because of the now -created deficiency, rationing is introduced.

109
00:14:49.800 --> 00:15:01.400
This means that the state forces an adaptation of demand so that it will match the range it can deliver.

110
00:15:01.400 --> 00:15:09.100
The state is now starting to regulate more and more prices increasingly harder to cover its rampant production costs,

111
00:15:09.100 --> 00:15:15.900
At the same time as the economy is shrinking in an accelerating vicious circle.

112
00:15:15.900 --> 00:15:28.100
Finally, the economy collapses completely and when society is crashed into misery and poverty, capitalism is blamed.

113
00:15:28.100 --> 00:15:38.040
These ten points depict how exactly all socialist countries in history have collapsed.
 This is so basic,

114
00:15:38.040 --> 00:15:48.140
So accepted and so empirically well -placed that everyone who has read economics at the upper secondary level can account for its relationship.

115
00:15:48.140 --> 00:15:54.440
This is probably also why Sweden's Perplexa Finance Minister could not explain to Camilla Kvartoft

116
00:15:54.440 --> 00:16:03.000
Why price regulations lead to deficiency: because the connection is so obvious that it would be like suddenly being held accountable for why

117
00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:07.700
gravity would cause objects to fall to the ground.

118
00:16:07.700 --> 00:16:16.600
So if Sweden's financial situation is partly self -inflicted and cannot be corrected with price regulations

119
00:16:16.600 --> 00:16:20.400
What should one really do

120
00:16:27.060 --> 00:16:34.620
It is telling that both the Left Party's economic spokesperson Ali Esbati and party leader Nooshi Dadgostar

121
00:16:34.620 --> 00:16:43.820
Completely dismisses the 75 years of consistent economic empiricism that contradicts their market interventionist policy.

122
00:16:43.820 --> 00:16:48.220
But that would not have any good effects, says Lars Jonung if you introduced price ceilings.

123
00:16:48.220 --> 00:16:56.580
But Lars talks about long historical events, many situations that have divorced dramatically

124
00:16:56.580 --> 00:16:58.620
And as there is still debate.

125
00:16:58.620 --> 00:17:06.120
There is a shortage, it also becomes bureaucratic, many economists think this is a bad idea simply,

126
00:17:06.120 --> 00:17:11.100
That you should not go in and control a market that way.
 There are many economists who also perceive that it is not.

127
00:17:11.100 --> 00:17:22.700
But outside the left's most pure study circles in Marxist revolutionary theory, there is no debate that planning economics does not work.

128
00:17:22.700 --> 00:17:31.900
It is also telling that some on the left flank now compare the ambition to lower the tax on fuel with price control

129
00:17:31.900 --> 00:17:40.200
Because it only shows how little this movement actually knows about finances.

130
00:17:40.200 --> 00:17:47.000
Namely, lowering a tax is essentially different from introducing a regulation,

131
00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:52.120
Then the former liberates the market forces so that they can correct

132
00:17:52.120 --> 00:17:57.420
While the latter locks both economy and market.

133
00:17:57.420 --> 00:18:01.980
Here are a couple of simple and most important of all

134
00:18:01.980 --> 00:18:11.180
Functioning suggestions for those who want lower prices and a more healthy social economy in both the short and long term:

135
00:18:11.180 --> 00:18:20.080
One: To help the households struggling with the high prices in the short term.

136
00:18:20.080 --> 00:18:29.880
It strengthens both the labor market and the survival capacity of households, completely without having to regulate the market.

137
00:18:29.880 --> 00:18:40.580
Two: To improve the Swedish economy in the long term and lower prices: Provide tax deductions for newly established small -scale grocery stores.

138
00:18:40.580 --> 00:18:51.580
Make the fuels cheaper to stimulate agriculture and logistics sector and create long -term conditions for rapid expansion of new nuclear power

139
00:18:51.580 --> 00:18:57.780
to drive down the production cost for input goods and consumer price indexes.

140
00:18:57.780 --> 00:19:12.380
For just like the "Sickans" well -being plans, the state's financial plans also put everyone involved in deep freedom.
