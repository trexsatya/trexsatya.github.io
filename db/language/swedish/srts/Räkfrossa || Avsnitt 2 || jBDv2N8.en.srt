1
00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.000
-Thanks so much.
 -Thanks.

2
00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:45.200
Welcome to shrimp frozen.
 We have had a stressful week.

3
00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:52.880
- We have had a premiere party with Johan.
 - It was fun to suck in praise.

4
00:00:53.040 --> 00:01:00.040
I walked around and wrote autographs.
 I almost wrote a girl on the tits.

5
00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:07.800
Some guy's new shirt - my name straight over.
 After all, they become cursed.

6
00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:14.120
"Stick from here, fucking idiot!"
 It's hopeless.
 But there were a lot of girls.

7
00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:17.280
Yes, it was very glamorous.

8
00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:24.920
I had sex with a model.
 It was on a scale of 1: 3.
 I myself built it.

9
00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:31.080
- A aircraft model?
 -Yes exactly.
 It was quite painful.

10
00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:35.240
There are tricks to get a good party.

11
00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:38.400
Some companies rent out look -alikes.

12
00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:45.800
Then you can take someone who looks like Bruce Willis or Julia Roberts.

13
00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:51.960
- We had a look -alike at our party.
 - Did it work well?

14
00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:55.240
No, he wasn't so similar ...

15
00:01:57.320 --> 00:02:00.920
Hello.
 Johan.
 It's my party.

16
00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:07.080
- We probably haven't met before.
 - I'm Phil Collins.

17
00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:12.080
Hey.
 Phil Collins.
 - Phil Collins.
 - Phil.

18
00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:17.320
 I can feel it coming in the air tonight

19
00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:23.480
 It's Another Day For You And Me In Paradise I was flown in this morning.

20
00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:29.640
 I can feel it ... many ask: "What is it like to be Phil Collins?"

21
00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:36.440
"How does it feel to be such a famous guy?"
 I am like ordinary people.

22
00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:39.760
 Oh, Lord!
 Oh, Lord ...

23
00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:44.920
- Do you have Tonic?
 - Yes, there at Phil Collins.

24
00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:50.480
Phil Collins is standing over there.
 The old man in gray beard.

25
00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:57.040
"Quiet in the studio! I don't sing a tone if it's not quiet in the studio."

26
00:02:57.200 --> 00:03:00.760
That is my style, so I want it.

27
00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:10.320
- Have you had a good week, Johan?
 - Yes, I've been hanging out with my friends.

28
00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:16.480
We meet in a cave in the forest and read poems for each other.

29
00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:20.640
We met during the boarding school.

30
00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:24.640
We had an incredibly good teacher.

31
00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:30.800
He always said, "Catch the day, guys. Suck the marrow out of life."

32
00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:33.960
Unfortunately, he was forced to quit.

33
00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:40.120
But then we stood on the benches and said: "Oh, Captain, My Captain!"

34
00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:44.280
You think of "Kill Poets Society".

35
00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:52.360
Yes I do!
 God, what stupid!
 Right.
 I've slept so badly tonight.

36
00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:58.320
-What have you done?
 - I've been out with the guys.

37
00:03:58.480 --> 00:04:04.480
We stand out and camp and sit around the campfire in the evening.

38
00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:07.640
Someone brings out a bottle of whiskey.

39
00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:14.800
We sat and played guitar and suddenly a banjo answered in the forest.

40
00:04:14.960 --> 00:04:20.960
Bo -Ro -Bom - Pom ... Hell!
 My friend went and checked what it was.

41
00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:27.920
He was raped by two foresters.
 He screamed like a pig: Ouuuiii!

42
00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:34.080
Terrible!
 Then Burt Reynolds came and shot them with a bow.

43
00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:37.440
Don't you think about "the last journey"?

44
00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:43.400
- Oh, yes!
 Sorry.
 - You are burnt out.
 You work too much.

45
00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:49.560
-What have you done then?
 - Not anything, sat at home with the acid.

46
00:04:49.720 --> 00:04:55.720
Our neighbor girl is completely crazy.
 She is strong.
 She is the world's richest girl.

47
00:04:55.880 --> 00:04:59.880
She has a whole jacket with money.

48
00:05:00.040 --> 00:05:06.040
The police come home and harass her.
 They are called Kling and Klang.

49
00:05:06.200 --> 00:05:09.200
She just raises their car.

50
00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:16.360
Pippi Longstocking.
 It is a book by Astrid Lindgren.
 What's with you?

51
00:05:16.520 --> 00:05:20.120
-Always!
 - You work too much.

52
00:05:20.280 --> 00:05:26.280
- You also work a lot.
 - Yes, I can't rest at home either.

53
00:05:26.440 --> 00:05:32.440
My two step sisters drive with me.
 I'll dust, clean, wash.

54
00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:41.560
Fortunately, I have nice mice and birds.
 They sewed a dress for me.

55
00:05:47.400 --> 00:05:53.400
- So dangerous was it not?
 - Yes, but the whole scare sounded sour.

56
00:05:53.560 --> 00:05:59.560
That they pay for such crap!
 And so you have to talk to them later.

57
00:05:59.720 --> 00:06:05.560
I hate going backstage when the show is bad.

58
00:06:05.720 --> 00:06:08.720
 Twinkle Twinkle Little Star

59
00:06:08.880 --> 00:06:11.880
 How I wonder where you are

60
00:06:12.040 --> 00:06:15.840
 Far are you attracting my vision

61
00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:19.720
- Is it your daughter?
 -No.

62
00:06:20.720 --> 00:06:24.600
How good you were!
 You sang so nicely!

63
00:06:28.280 --> 00:06:33.680
Does anyone have chlamydia?
 Raise one hand.

64
00:06:33.840 --> 00:06:37.520
No?
 You seem a little insecure.

65
00:06:37.680 --> 00:06:43.680
There is nothing to be ashamed of.
 I was on chlamydia test.
 That was interesting.

66
00:06:43.840 --> 00:06:49.840
Tops with which you pee your ears - they are available in many sizes.

67
00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:53.000
Did you also receive a yellow form -

68
00:06:53.160 --> 00:06:59.160
- Where you fill in the name of everyone you have had sex with the last month?

69
00:06:59.320 --> 00:07:04.320
They are called for sampling.
 If they do not come, they can be punished.

70
00:07:04.480 --> 00:07:10.480
I thought, "Here I have my chance!"
 I wrote all I am annoyed at:

71
00:07:10.640 --> 00:07:16.440
Gudrun Schyman, Arja Saijonmaa, Phil Collins ...

72
00:07:16.600 --> 00:07:22.600
That explains the notice I got to the Veneric Clinic.

73
00:07:23.600 --> 00:07:26.600
It's fun with bus and hood.

74
00:07:26.760 --> 00:07:32.760
You know when Jehovah's Witnesses come home and knock on the door.

75
00:07:32.920 --> 00:07:38.920
Then I do not get annoyed like others, but I find out where they live.

76
00:07:39.080 --> 00:07:45.080
Then I go to them and knock on: "Hi, I'm from ordinary people."

77
00:07:45.240 --> 00:07:48.840
"Here's a newspaper I've done."

78
00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:53.000
I am on the subtle revenge.

79
00:07:53.160 --> 00:07:59.160
If I get a lot of money, I'll buy a lot of accordion groups.

80
00:07:59.320 --> 00:08:05.760
Then they should be placed in every street corner in Peru.
 They send their guys here.

81
00:08:05.920 --> 00:08:09.920
We will talk a little about bus and hide.

82
00:08:10.080 --> 00:08:16.080
Before the program we called and ordered a taxi in false name.

83
00:08:22.200 --> 00:08:28.200
Has anyone in the audience made any fun bus or hush?
 Do we have anyone here?

84
00:08:28.360 --> 00:08:34.360
-Hey.
 You have made some fun bus.
 - Yes, it's fun with horror.

85
00:08:34.520 --> 00:08:40.520
It keeps a young to the mind.
 I can take my favorite.

86
00:08:40.680 --> 00:08:46.680
I go down to the cemetery in the middle of the night and park at a tombstone.

87
00:08:46.840 --> 00:08:53.840
Then I pull a line from the car to the tombstone.
 Then just gas.

88
00:08:55.160 --> 00:09:01.160
In the end, the whole stone overturns!
 Imagine the next day when people come ...

89
00:09:01.320 --> 00:09:06.920
Great fun!
 And I usually go to someone who is in a respirator at the hospital.

90
00:09:07.080 --> 00:09:10.080
We will move on.

91
00:09:10.240 --> 00:09:16.240
- Yes, you may have something there.
 - Yes, I'm here with an anonymous lady.

92
00:09:16.400 --> 00:09:22.400
- What are you finding for Unfog?
 - I usually bust in my workplace.

93
00:09:22.560 --> 00:09:27.160
We take turns getting coffee in the dining room.

94
00:09:27.320 --> 00:09:33.320
My colleague Ulla usually just wants a sugar bite in her coffee.

95
00:09:33.480 --> 00:09:38.080
But on Thursday I got full in fank -

96
00:09:38.240 --> 00:09:44.240
- And when she didn't see, I instead put in two pieces of sugar.

97
00:09:46.520 --> 00:09:49.120
Oh.

98
00:09:49.280 --> 00:09:55.280
Bus and Hyss can also have a best before -date.
 Everything doesn't always work.

99
00:09:55.440 --> 00:10:02.440
My nephew is five years old.
 He wants to cuddle with - scare life out of the kid.

100
00:10:02.600 --> 00:10:08.600
Last time I was thinking of ghosting.
 It worked when my brother haunted me.

101
00:10:08.760 --> 00:10:14.760
I brought out a big sheet and painted two large, disgusting, red eyes.

102
00:10:14.920 --> 00:10:19.320
He will call the police, I thought.

103
00:10:19.480 --> 00:10:25.480
I entered his room at night.
 "Bu! Uncle is ghost. I'm so dangerous."

104
00:10:25.640 --> 00:10:31.640
When a five -year -old in 2000 sees his uncle in a sheet of two spots -

105
00:10:31.800 --> 00:10:37.600
- He doesn't call the police.
 He called via directly.

106
00:10:37.760 --> 00:10:43.760
When a five -year -old calls via directly and asks how to remove stains -

107
00:10:43.920 --> 00:10:46.920
- Then it is they who call the police.

108
00:10:47.080 --> 00:10:53.480
You easily get lost in our new, fast society.
 You may need a guide.

109
00:10:53.640 --> 00:10:59.840
That is why we present with great pleasure our lifestyle consultant - Henrik Elmér.

110
00:11:03.600 --> 00:11:10.600
Thanks so much.
 Welcome to part two of the course "Meet Life with Henrik".

111
00:11:10.760 --> 00:11:15.760
Last time I said you could order the booklet.

112
00:11:15.920 --> 00:11:18.920
It has not come from the printing company -

113
00:11:19.080 --> 00:11:25.080
- But it only gives me the opportunity to demonstrate my positive attitude.

114
00:11:25.240 --> 00:11:31.240
The great art of life is to find solutions to small problems.

115
00:11:31.400 --> 00:11:34.400
Some of my friends have married.

116
00:11:34.560 --> 00:11:39.560
Then it is important to fix a neat kidnapping to the tail sex.

117
00:11:39.720 --> 00:11:45.720
Then you want to surprise him with something unexpected, but it never works.

118
00:11:45.880 --> 00:11:48.880
He realizes it's tail sex.

119
00:11:49.040 --> 00:11:55.040
So now I'm planning a tail sex for a guy who shouldn't get married.

120
00:11:55.200 --> 00:11:58.200
He is surprised.

121
00:11:58.360 --> 00:12:04.360
Another example from life is this when you are on the toilet.

122
00:12:04.520 --> 00:12:10.920
Outside you meet someone who you have to greet and your hand is wet.

123
00:12:11.080 --> 00:12:17.320
The person you say goodbye says, "It's not a kiss? - No, it's water."

124
00:12:17.480 --> 00:12:23.280
Why can't you be honest there?
 It's weird.

125
00:12:23.440 --> 00:12:26.440
He sounds strange

126
00:12:31.680 --> 00:12:37.680
I do this when itchy in my throat.
 It is also problem solving.

127
00:12:37.840 --> 00:12:40.840
If it scratches your neck, you scratch.

128
00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:47.000
But itch it inside most people think that there is nothing to do about it.

129
00:12:47.160 --> 00:12:54.160
Then you can do this ... because if you drive down your fingers you vomit.

130
00:12:55.840 --> 00:13:01.960
Which is unsuccessful for us into love.
 When one comes close to a woman -

131
00:13:02.120 --> 00:13:09.120
- So it is the same feeling as after vomiting - it is positive.

132
00:13:09.280 --> 00:13:15.320
Imagine if you get so close to a woman and then you vomit.

133
00:13:15.480 --> 00:13:22.280
It must be fantastic.
 But maybe you should let the girl vomit first.

134
00:13:22.440 --> 00:13:28.440
Girls are so whimsical.
 You never know how a girl should react.

135
00:13:28.600 --> 00:13:34.760
You follow a girl from the pub and think it will be cozy.

136
00:13:34.920 --> 00:13:41.520
But when you come home to her, she changes herself and gets angry.

137
00:13:41.680 --> 00:13:49.080
Last time I told you about my BC
 Girl Gunilla.
 She was so there.

138
00:13:49.240 --> 00:13:56.240
She lay all night, whining about a guy she went home.

139
00:13:56.400 --> 00:13:59.400
In the morning I got to comfort him.

140
00:13:59.560 --> 00:14:05.560
And I did, because I think you should take care of each other.

141
00:14:05.720 --> 00:14:09.680
We will continue next time.
 Thanks.

142
00:14:10.680 --> 00:14:15.520
Is Henrik a good lifestyle consultant?

143
00:14:15.680 --> 00:14:21.960
I think he is pretty good - at that price.
 We don't give him much.

144
00:14:22.120 --> 00:14:27.120
- He is kept away from the streets.
 - He's weird.

145
00:14:27.280 --> 00:14:33.280
- You should not talk shit, Johan.
 - No, that's the worst thing there is.

146
00:14:33.440 --> 00:14:39.440
My friend Martin talks shit about everyone.
 He's an idiot.

147
00:14:39.600 --> 00:14:45.600
- It's so fun that they are together.
 - It has been looking at each other.

148
00:14:46.360 --> 00:14:52.360
Malin has always wanted to have a relationship.
 I am going to go to the toilet.

149
00:14:54.080 --> 00:15:00.920
I don't want to talk shit, but do you know that Johan's family does not have Christmas tables?

150
00:15:01.080 --> 00:15:07.080
No ham - nothing.
 Isn't that a little sick?

151
00:15:07.240 --> 00:15:13.040
It is a holiday that you should celebrate together.

152
00:15:13.200 --> 00:15:19.200
How deep can you sink?
 - Johan, was it good to pee?

153
00:15:20.960 --> 00:15:26.960
- Should I take the next round, right?
 - But Erik, what a schyst.
 What a schyst.

154
00:15:27.120 --> 00:15:32.120
It's awful with those who talk shit about others -

155
00:15:32.280 --> 00:15:39.680
- But Erik was happy when his mother died.
 How swine can you be?

156
00:15:39.840 --> 00:15:46.240
His own mother.
 He inherited money and everything like that.

157
00:15:46.400 --> 00:15:52.400
It was almost as if he stood and laughed at her funeral.

158
00:15:52.560 --> 00:15:59.120
Now he is raising with her blood money.
 - Erik, always just as generous.

159
00:15:59.280 --> 00:16:04.880
- You can trust.
 - I should buy cigarettes.

160
00:16:05.040 --> 00:16:10.320
Excuse me, but ... Johan - it's a real asshole.

161
00:16:10.480 --> 00:16:16.480
- I heard that.
 - Are you paranoid?
 I didn't mean you.

162
00:16:17.120 --> 00:16:24.680
I don't want to talk shit, that's the worst thing there is. But Johan is an AS.

163
00:16:24.840 --> 00:16:28.840
- Well, don't you have a cig?
 -Yes.

164
00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:31.600
Phone signal

165
00:16:31.760 --> 00:16:38.880
No, it's Håkan.
 He is the dullest and most boring bastard I've met.

166
00:16:39.040 --> 00:16:44.840
Do you know what he did on holiday?
 Nothing, type.

167
00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:51.000
Tjena, Håkan.
 Lucky you call.
 I stand here with some idiots.

168
00:16:51.160 --> 00:16:58.160
You have to come here.
 I can't cope with them.
 Everyone just talks shit.

169
00:17:00.440 --> 00:17:08.320
Do you know that Erik's brother is working on Skanska, despite this with Rhoca Gil?

170
00:17:10.640 --> 00:17:14.760
Håkan, are you left?
 Yes, show up here.

171
00:17:14.920 --> 00:17:20.920
Yes, unfortunately - the evening is destroyed.
 That idiot comes here.

172
00:17:25.400 --> 00:17:30.400
- "Thelma and Louise." Have you seen it?
 -No.

173
00:17:30.560 --> 00:17:36.800
I was completely put when I saw it.
 It is the end that comes so unexpectedly.

174
00:17:36.960 --> 00:17:41.360
It will be SEK 45.
 Thank you.

175
00:17:42.360 --> 00:17:49.360
A fifth back.
 Then we will find the movie too.
 There we have it, yes.

176
00:17:49.520 --> 00:17:52.760
So ... they both die.

177
00:17:52.920 --> 00:17:58.920
They drive out for a cliff with the car - with diligence.
 It is not wise.

178
00:17:59.080 --> 00:18:01.880
Welcome back.

179
00:18:10.200 --> 00:18:16.200
We are fortunate to get paid to stand on TV and trampling.

180
00:18:16.360 --> 00:18:22.440
Many people find it difficult to find what to do in working life.
 "What is right?"

181
00:18:22.600 --> 00:18:25.600
It will easily be some prestige.

182
00:18:25.760 --> 00:18:31.760
I had a reunion with the high school class.
 Everyone has new, cool jobs.

183
00:18:31.920 --> 00:18:35.200
One is Global Key Account Manager.

184
00:18:35.360 --> 00:18:39.960
He sells vacuum cleaners throughout Sweden.

185
00:18:40.120 --> 00:18:45.120
Another friend is a layout - outlaws.

186
00:18:46.920 --> 00:18:53.680
- I have worked a lot with advertising.
 - You have distributed advertising.

187
00:18:53.840 --> 00:18:58.840
I never liked the advertising industry.
 There is so much to hold in your head.

188
00:18:59.000 --> 00:19:01.800
Gate codes and ...

189
00:19:01.960 --> 00:19:08.080
- It's so cold in the advertising industry.
 - Yes, you have to take a jacket on yourself.

190
00:19:09.400 --> 00:19:13.400
I have wanted to work with computers.

191
00:19:13.560 --> 00:19:19.560
This summer I would work at a company.
 I would work with the data.

192
00:19:19.720 --> 00:19:25.720
But it was a guy named Data, Datan Manevski.
 He packed cucumbers.

193
00:19:25.880 --> 00:19:31.880
It's a shame it didn't work.
 It is important to activate yourself.

194
00:19:32.040 --> 00:19:39.040
Last summer I traveled around the countryside and inseminated cows.

195
00:19:39.200 --> 00:19:42.200
You know that with the rubber glove.

196
00:19:42.360 --> 00:19:49.080
I was doing that for three weeks.
 I was forced to quit when a farmer saw me.

197
00:19:49.240 --> 00:19:55.520
I've had a real job.
 I was an IT consultant at a web agency.

198
00:19:55.680 --> 00:20:01.680
What I like best about the new economy is the distance work.

199
00:20:01.840 --> 00:20:08.440
The computer was my work tool, with it I came to the company's network.

200
00:20:08.600 --> 00:20:14.600
Communication is done via e -mail, but I had a separate fax as well.

201
00:20:14.760 --> 00:20:20.760
There were video conferencing.
 You see the little camera.

202
00:20:23.840 --> 00:20:27.440
The living room became my coffee room.

203
00:20:27.600 --> 00:20:31.600
It's just a matter of discipline.

204
00:20:31.760 --> 00:20:37.760
But you do not get away then when you have no one to babble with.

205
00:20:37.920 --> 00:20:44.520
A good thing about working at home is that you can dress how you want.

206
00:20:44.680 --> 00:20:50.680
After a while I realized that you can do the work from the bedroom.

207
00:20:50.840 --> 00:20:55.400
The important thing is to deliver on time.

208
00:20:55.560 --> 00:21:01.160
The more time you save, the more efficient you work.

209
00:21:01.320 --> 00:21:07.400
The network economy is based on being online all the time.

210
00:21:07.560 --> 00:21:13.760
I handled all my purchases online.
 I never had to leave the apartment.

211
00:21:13.920 --> 00:21:19.920
The disadvantage of the new economy is that people are connected all the time.

212
00:21:20.080 --> 00:21:23.080
You have to force yourself to be free.

213
00:21:24.920 --> 00:21:30.920
The less time you spend outside the bed, the more efficient the day.

214
00:21:31.080 --> 00:21:37.080
You never have to leave the bed.
 You can take care of all needs from there.

215
00:21:37.240 --> 00:21:43.240
The disadvantage is that many miss the exercise.
 You get some sleeping wounds.

216
00:21:43.400 --> 00:21:46.400
So it will be if you want to keep up.

217
00:21:50.800 --> 00:21:54.200
- I take them here.
 -Where are you going?

218
00:21:54.360 --> 00:21:57.360
I'll polish them.

219
00:21:57.520 --> 00:22:02.720
- Have you paid?
 - No, it's on an invoice.

220
00:22:02.880 --> 00:22:07.960
- I'll probably check that.
 - You get them back on Tuesday.

221
00:22:08.120 --> 00:22:11.120
I have not heard of that.

222
00:22:11.280 --> 00:22:14.280
- I talked to Evy.
 -Who?

223
00:22:14.440 --> 00:22:19.440
-What is her name?
 Elsa ...?
 - There's no one like this.

224
00:22:19.600 --> 00:22:24.600
- I have talked to the manager.
 - I am a manager here.

225
00:22:24.760 --> 00:22:30.840
No, I took a robber.
 If so, it goes.
 So you do, right?

226
00:22:31.000 --> 00:22:33.800
Yes, yes ... Hello then.

227
00:22:39.160 --> 00:22:45.160
It is said that many of our needs, fears and desires -

228
00:22:45.320 --> 00:22:48.800
- Dives into our dreams at night.

229
00:22:48.960 --> 00:22:55.560
We have studied some dream interpretation and will try to interpret our dreams.

230
00:22:55.720 --> 00:22:58.520
My most common dream-

231
00:22:58.680 --> 00:23:04.680
- Is I sit on a train that is on my way into a tunnel at full speed.

232
00:23:04.840 --> 00:23:10.840
But it derails just before, then it lies just asleep.

233
00:23:11.000 --> 00:23:17.680
You have to get it up again and get into the tunnel, but it is not possible.

234
00:23:17.840 --> 00:23:20.840
-No what is it?

235
00:23:21.920 --> 00:23:27.360
That is very typical.
 You have travel fever.

236
00:23:27.520 --> 00:23:33.520
You are worried about going train down to Skåne.
 It's a concern.

237
00:23:33.680 --> 00:23:39.680
I dream that I have a very beautiful rose that I want to water.

238
00:23:39.840 --> 00:23:44.840
But as soon as I touch the water hose, the water sprays out.

239
00:23:45.000 --> 00:23:51.600
Then you stand there with a slack hose and the rose dries again and withered.

240
00:23:52.640 --> 00:23:56.640
I have a theory.
 It's a little embarrassing.

241
00:23:56.800 --> 00:23:59.800
You are worried about the declaration.

242
00:23:59.960 --> 00:24:05.960
The rose is the tax office and the hose is deducted.

243
00:24:06.120 --> 00:24:10.120
You need mental keys to solve it.

244
00:24:10.280 --> 00:24:16.280
I often dream that I am a snake that will eel me into a tunnel.

245
00:24:16.440 --> 00:24:20.440
- There is chocolate.
 -Chocolate?

246
00:24:20.600 --> 00:24:24.040
It's a cocoa tunnel, you might say.

247
00:24:24.200 --> 00:24:30.560
I try to squeeze my head, but I get rid of.

248
00:24:30.720 --> 00:24:37.720
I have a similar dream - that I am going into the big Nutella Valley.

249
00:24:37.880 --> 00:24:40.880
But the guards stop me all the time.

250
00:24:41.040 --> 00:24:47.040
I say: "Please, all my friends have been here."
 But I don't get.

251
00:24:47.200 --> 00:24:54.720
- I don't understand what it might be.
 - You are burnt out.
 You work too much.

252
00:24:57.400 --> 00:25:03.400
- Eriksson went up 2 % today.
 -Is it true?
 Yesterday everything went down.

253
00:25:03.560 --> 00:25:06.560
The IT shares pull up the entire index.

254
00:25:06.720 --> 00:25:12.720
It is private individuals who account for most of the sales of IT shares.

255
00:25:12.880 --> 00:25:16.480
That bubble bursts at any time.

256
00:25:16.640 --> 00:25:22.680
Hello.
 - Don't be so sure.
 IT companies in the United States are much higher valued.

257
00:25:22.840 --> 00:25:28.840
- You have spilled something on the shirt.
 - Yes, you have something at the collar.

258
00:25:40.040 --> 00:25:46.440
She is so ego.
 When talking, she interrupts and changes the subject.

259
00:25:46.600 --> 00:25:52.160
She has neither artistic talent nor social skills.

260
00:25:52.320 --> 00:25:57.320
-I have drawn.
 -Can I see?
 What is it?

261
00:25:57.480 --> 00:26:01.480
-It is a horse.
 -How nice!

262
00:26:01.640 --> 00:26:07.800
Very nice!
 You have drawn four legs and one head, but you have forgotten the tail.

263
00:26:07.960 --> 00:26:11.960
I think it's great.

264
00:26:14.120 --> 00:26:19.120
She would not recognize a horse if it bit her in the ass.

265
00:26:22.360 --> 00:26:25.360
It's time to say thank you and hello.

266
00:26:25.520 --> 00:26:31.520
Yes, but next week we have a top program.
 Robert Gustafsson is coming.

267
00:26:31.680 --> 00:26:35.680
- We have had fun.
 - Have you had fun?

268
00:26:35.840 --> 00:26:38.240
Yeah.

269
00:26:39.880 --> 00:26:42.880
I haven't had much fun.

270
00:26:45.840 --> 00:26:52.840
I have a hard week.
 The husband is sick.
 You bring that bag here.

271
00:26:54.960 --> 00:27:01.280
- You can come back next time.
 - No, you, I don't think so.

272
00:27:01.440 --> 00:27:04.440
Okay.
 Yes, yes ... thank you.

273
00:27:04.600 --> 00:27:10.600
Don't forget: You are the audience, we are the comedians, here is the stage.

274
00:27:10.760 --> 00:27:14.760
- Oh bite!
 –Wa?
 - Wait wait...

275
00:27:14.920 --> 00:27:19.520
- It sat like a spear.
 -What was that?

276
00:27:19.680 --> 00:27:25.680
All programs have a "catchfrase".
 Peter Harryson has: Hi, Mom.

277
00:27:25.840 --> 00:27:31.240
We have: You are the audience, we are the comedians, here is the stage.
 Well!

278
00:27:31.400 --> 00:27:37.400
It means nothing.
 We talk through that.
 - Bye!

279
00:28:28.880 --> 00:28:31.880
SVT Program texting: Barbro Magnusson

280
00:28:32.080 --> 00:28:34.680
CRYING

281
00:28:36.320 --> 00:28:42.120
Come out now, Stefan.
 It is not the whole world.

282
00:28:43.800 --> 00:28:49.600
Sharpen now, Stefan!
 You can't bother the whole.
