1
00:00:06,600 --> 00:00:09,050
Then we are back with ten unnecessary

2
00:00:09,050 --> 00:00:14,200
Facts that you may not know about.

3
00:00:14,266 --> 00:00:16,766
I was going to start directly with a small question.

4
00:00:16,766 --> 00:00:21,900
What do you think first came the postit note or calculator?

5
00:00:21,983 --> 00:00:24,650
Do you think a bundle of paper with a faint glue

6
00:00:24,650 --> 00:00:27,850
As you can make small notes on Come first?

7
00:00:27,916 --> 00:00:31,750
Or do you think an electronic calculator who can math

8
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,966
came first?

9
00:00:34,966 --> 00:00:36,983
It was actually the calculator.

10
00:00:36,983 --> 00:00:38,850
Believe it or not.

11
00:00:38,850 --> 00:00:42,083
The first portable calculator was invented in 1967

12
00:00:42,083 --> 00:00:45,083
by Texas Instruments

13
00:00:45,150 --> 00:00:48,966
and could perform basic mathematical calculations as

14
00:00:49,050 --> 00:00:53,583
Addition, subtraction, multiplication and division.

15
00:00:53,666 --> 00:00:57,566
Post-it note came to the market in 1980.

16
00:00:57,650 --> 00:01:00,300
But the glue itself used to hold together

17
00:01:00,300 --> 00:01:06,216
The pieces of paper were actually invented in 1968 by Spencer Silver,

18
00:01:06,300 --> 00:01:10,066
a scientist at 3M, and was invented by a mistake by him

19
00:01:10,066 --> 00:01:13,066
tried to create a super strong glue,

20
00:01:13,250 --> 00:01:19,366
But instead ended with a weak pressure sensitive glue.

21
00:01:19,450 --> 00:01:20,250
Snails

22
00:01:20,250 --> 00:01:21,233
Teeth

23
00:01:21,233 --> 00:01:24,150
Have you ever seen a snail smile at you?

24
00:01:24,150 --> 00:01:29,516
Snails actually have thousands of small teeth lying on a band inside your mouth.

25
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:32,866
This band is called Radula and the teeth

26
00:01:32,866 --> 00:01:35,866
used to scrape or cut food.

27
00:01:35,966 --> 00:01:38,566
They are microscopically small so not so

28
00:01:38,566 --> 00:01:41,916
Strange that you don't notice when a snail smiles at you.

29
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,000
If now snails can smile at all,

30
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:53,816
What would a snail with human teeth look like?

31
00:01:53,900 --> 00:01:58,266
Okay, we're moving on.

32
00:01:58,350 --> 00:02:00,050
The smell of the moon.

33
00:02:00,050 --> 00:02:03,466
Astronauts who visited the moon reported afterwards

34
00:02:03,466 --> 00:02:07,233
that the moon's dust has a very distinct smell,

35
00:02:07,316 --> 00:02:13,766
Similar burnt powder or wet ash.

36
00:02:13,850 --> 00:02:15,600
According to Thai law it is

37
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:20,600
illegal to harm, destroy or show a lack of respect for banknotes or

38
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:26,133
Coins containing depictions of the king or other members of the royal family.

39
00:02:26,216 --> 00:02:30,450
This includes actions such as pedaling or tearing down banknotes.

40
00:02:30,533 --> 00:02:36,750
It is a crime to insult, threaten or slander the king, queen, successor or regent.

41
00:02:36,833 --> 00:02:45,216
The punishment for these crimes can be very serious, including long prison sentences.

42
00:02:45,300 --> 00:02:47,033
Koalor's sleep

43
00:02:47,033 --> 00:02:50,316
Koalor is among the mammals that sleep the longest.

44
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:55,050
They can sleep up to 18 to 22 hours a day.

45
00:02:55,133 --> 00:02:58,716
And if you didn't know it, a day has only 24 hours.

46
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:02,000
Their long sleep is an adaptation to their diet

47
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:06,000
which consists mostly of eucalyptus leaves.

48
00:03:06,083 --> 00:03:09,200
They contain very little nutrition but have a high fiber

49
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:13,766
slippery and requires a lot of energy to digest.

50
00:03:13,850 --> 00:03:17,250
Giraffes are among the mammals that sleep least.

51
00:03:17,333 --> 00:03:21,600
In the wild, giraffes sleep only about 30 minutes per day.

52
00:03:21,833 --> 00:03:24,650
This short sleeping time is often distributed in small

53
00:03:24,650 --> 00:03:27,933
Taps that last for a few minutes at a time.

54
00:03:28,016 --> 00:03:32,400
Because giraffes need to be alert to avoid predators' attacks.

55
00:03:32,483 --> 00:03:37,800
Newborn calves sleep more, but are also protected by other giraffes that watch over them.

56
00:03:37,883 --> 00:03:41,866
Giraffes can sleep both standing and lying down, but adult giraffes

57
00:03:41,866 --> 00:03:46,650
often prefer to sleep standing to be able to quickly escape from predators.

58
00:03:46,733 --> 00:03:49,433
In captivity you might be allowed to sleep longer

59
00:03:49,433 --> 00:03:55,600
up to 6 hours per day on average.

60
00:03:55,666 --> 00:03:58,816
Mercury is the only metallic element that is

61
00:03:58,816 --> 00:04:03,550
Liquid at room temperature, making it unique among metals.

62
00:04:03,616 --> 00:04:06,766
This is because of its very low melting point

63
00:04:06,766 --> 00:04:11,050
at -38.83 degrees Celsius.

64
00:04:11,116 --> 00:04:14,650
Most other metals have the melting point that is much higher,

65
00:04:14,716 --> 00:04:20,266
such as steel that melts at 1400 to 1500

66
00:04:20,266 --> 00:04:24,333
degrees Celsius

67
00:04:24,416 --> 00:04:26,900
The chlorine smell in swimming pools.

68
00:04:26,900 --> 00:04:29,250
The distinct chlorine smell that one often feels

69
00:04:29,250 --> 00:04:32,950
In swimming pools is not just from the chlorine itself.

70
00:04:33,016 --> 00:04:36,983
It is actually the result of chlorine reacting with urine,

71
00:04:36,983 --> 00:04:40,383
Sweat and dirt from those who bathe there.

72
00:04:40,466 --> 00:04:45,700
This means that a strong claw smell can mean that a high level

73
00:04:45,766 --> 00:04:52,750
of these pollutants.

74
00:04:52,816 --> 00:04:54,050
Have you ever looked down on

75
00:04:54,050 --> 00:04:58,166
Your keyboard and wondered why the letters are placed as they are?

76
00:04:58,250 --> 00:05:02,716
This layout, called qwerty after the first six letters

77
00:05:02,716 --> 00:05:08,250
in the top row, was created during the 1870s by Christopher Sholes

78
00:05:08,333 --> 00:05:10,883
the inventor of the typewriter.

79
00:05:10,883 --> 00:05:16,150
The reason why the keys seem to be holes about noise and not in alphabetical order

80
00:05:16,216 --> 00:05:19,216
Depends on the typewriter as mechanics.

81
00:05:19,316 --> 00:05:22,800
When you wrote on a typewriter in the past and pushed down a

82
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:28,566
The key went a metal arm out with a letter that hit the paper.

83
00:05:28,650 --> 00:05:32,316
To reduce the risk of these arms stuck in each other,

84
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:35,266
especially in case of quick writing, so separated

85
00:05:35,266 --> 00:05:38,466
Shole's commonly occurring letter pairs.

86
00:05:38,550 --> 00:05:45,116
And this led to the layout we use today.

87
00:05:45,200 --> 00:05:47,600
The longest place names in the world

88
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:53,616
Available in New Zealand and is a Maori term for a hill in the Hawke's Bay region.

89
00:05:53,700 --> 00:05:58,616
The name is often shortened to Taumata for the sake of simplicity,

90
00:05:58,700 --> 00:06:03,250
But this is how the correct pronunciation sounds

91
00:06:03,316 --> 00:06:05,250
for almost an hour.

92
00:06:05,250 --> 00:06:08,816
Thank you for being for food is to look at how

93
00:06:08,900 --> 00:06:11,900
You get lookup and here to find this house.

94
00:06:12,150 --> 00:06:16,150
But there are other places with very long names.

95
00:06:16,216 --> 00:06:20,766
There is a village in Vienna that has one of the longest names in Europe.

96
00:06:20,850 --> 00:06:23,300
It's called to become the ice princess.

97
00:06:23,300 --> 00:06:26,200
Do you have any Swedish speech ref

98
00:06:26,283 --> 00:06:28,650
that is in English and

99
00:06:28,650 --> 00:06:33,716
It does not sell Google.

100
00:06:33,750 --> 00:06:39,000
If we find ... you will not get it for me and no.

101
00:06:39,083 --> 00:06:43,350
Equally tagged I'm, but I'm pretty angry

102
00:06:43,383 --> 00:06:45,766
Is pretty mad.

103
00:06:45,766 --> 00:06:48,966
Often shortened to Lake Webster

104
00:06:49,050 --> 00:06:53,550
It is the name of a lake and is said to mean you fish on your side.

105
00:06:53,633 --> 00:07:00,450
I fish on my side and no fish in the middle.

106
00:07:00,533 --> 00:07:04,166
The world's first SMS that incidentally stands for short

107
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:07,500
Message Service was sent on December 3.

108
00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:10,500
1992 by Neil Papworth

109
00:07:10,700 --> 00:07:14,400
A test engineer in the UK.

110
00:07:14,483 --> 00:07:19,533
The message was sent from Neil's computer to a manager at Vodafone,

111
00:07:19,616 --> 00:07:24,150
Richard Jarvis, and obeyed Merry Christmas.

112
00:07:24,233 --> 00:07:27,450
This historic SMS marked the beginning of

113
00:07:27,450 --> 00:07:32,966
a new era in digital communication and although less sms is sent today

114
00:07:32,966 --> 00:07:38,450
Due to all apps used, such as WhatsApp, Snapchat and Messenger and so on,

115
00:07:38,633 --> 00:07:41,600
So it will still be sent about 23 \ hillion

116
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:46,416
SMS every day around the world.

117
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:48,833
There were ten unnecessary facts.

118
00:07:48,833 --> 00:07:52,866
Part two Don't forget to subscribe to this channel.

119
00:07:52,950 --> 00:07:55,950
Feel free to put a thumbs up on the channel if you liked the video.

120
00:07:56,183 --> 00:07:59,533
And as always thanks for looking!
