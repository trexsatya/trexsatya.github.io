00:00:01,280 --> 00:00:04,352
Tjena My name is Marcus & I Driver SpareCash.se

2
00:00:05,888 --> 00:00:10,496
VoiceOver: In today's video I thought about telling us why I started SpareCash

3
00:00:10,752 --> 00:00:13,312
And how I started with stocks

4
00:00:13,824 --> 00:00:19,968
I think you will find it interesting if it is so that you recognize it in what it is like to be

5
00:00:20,224 --> 00:00:20,736
Beginner

6
00:00:20,992 --> 00:00:27,136
And how to feel paralyzed and unaware of why one should invest

7
00:00:27,392 --> 00:00:33,536
Money and how shares and funds work simply

8
00:00:41,216 --> 00:00:44,288
The point of this video it to show you

9
00:00:44,544 --> 00:00:50,688
Exactly how much more you will be able to learn after you have taken hold of learning how it works with

10
00:00:50,944 --> 00:00:57,088
Investment.
 Investments that I always complain about involves risk.
 But the risk is

11
00:00:57,344 --> 00:01:03,488
Other thing when talking about life not to invest your money in shares funds

12
00:01:03,744 --> 00:01:06,048
Without risk generally in life

13
00:01:07,328 --> 00:01:08,864
And when we talk about risk

14
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:10,400
Then I want to back the tape

15
00:01:10,656 --> 00:01:12,192
To the year 2013

16
00:01:13,728 --> 00:01:14,496
The year is

17
00:01:14,752 --> 00:01:15,264
null

18
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:17,312
The same year Jimmie Ã…kesson gets

19
00:01:17,568 --> 00:01:18,592
Cake in the face

20
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:20,384
Usain Bolt

21
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:22,176
Continues to run home gold

22
00:01:22,688 --> 00:01:23,200
And I take the student.

23
00:01:36,256 --> 00:01:42,144
During this summer I get a summer job at the post 'Okay what the hell it's a horse here'

24
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:48,544
Tjenare * laughs * what the hell

25
00:01:55,712 --> 00:01:57,248
This money I saved

26
00:01:57,760 --> 00:01:58,784
What would I do with them

27
00:01:59,040 --> 00:01:59,552
Yes

28
00:02:00,064 --> 00:02:02,880
I knew one could invest the money in any way

29
00:02:03,648 --> 00:02:05,184
In shares or funds

30
00:02:05,952 --> 00:02:07,232
But how does it really work?

31
00:02:08,256 --> 00:02:09,792
I had no idea how it

32
00:02:10,048 --> 00:02:10,816
In fact, works

33
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:13,632
I had no one in my family

34
00:02:13,888 --> 00:02:15,168
That could teach me about shares and funds

35
00:02:16,448 --> 00:02:16,960
I was told

36
00:02:17,216 --> 00:02:18,752
One could save the money in shares

37
00:02:20,288 --> 00:02:21,056
But I had no one who could learn how it actually

38
00:02:21,824 --> 00:02:22,592
Works

39
00:02:23,104 --> 00:02:23,616
So

40
00:02:23,872 --> 00:02:25,152
What do you have to do then

41
00:02:25,664 --> 00:02:26,688
Grab yourself of course

42
00:02:27,712 --> 00:02:31,040
And if you google funds and shares where you end up

43
00:02:31,296 --> 00:02:32,832
Well, of course

44
00:02:33,088 --> 00:02:33,856
Flashback

45
00:02:37,952 --> 00:02:41,536
And that's why I then chose to invest in Avanza Zero

46
00:02:42,048 --> 00:02:43,584
A free fund at Avanza

47
00:02:44,096 --> 00:02:46,144
I create an account at Avanza and I have

48
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:47,168
No clue

49
00:02:47,424 --> 00:02:48,192
What the hell

50
00:02:48,448 --> 00:02:49,472
I was doing

51
00:02:49,984 --> 00:02:51,520
And my point is to say that

52
00:02:51,776 --> 00:02:52,544
It is not so important to

53
00:02:53,056 --> 00:02:54,080
Know how it

54
00:02:54,336 --> 00:02:55,360
Works without the important thing here

55
00:02:55,616 --> 00:02:56,128
It is to actually put

56
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:57,152
Running

57
00:02:57,408 --> 00:02:58,176
And that's what I'm

58
00:02:58,432 --> 00:02:59,200
So happy about

59
00:02:59,456 --> 00:02:59,968
Look back that I

60
00:03:00,736 --> 00:03:01,504
Actually did it

61
00:03:02,016 --> 00:03:03,808
That I actually dared to take that risk

62
00:03:04,576 --> 00:03:05,344
To dare to invest my money

63
00:03:07,136 --> 00:03:09,696
One does not have to be a brain surgeon to invest or save their money

64
00:03:12,256 --> 00:03:13,792
So if it is so that you are

65
00:03:14,048 --> 00:03:15,072
Just as I was

66
00:03:15,584 --> 00:03:16,096
7 years ago

67
00:03:16,864 --> 00:03:21,472
You may be alone and you have no one in your family or family who can teach you how

68
00:03:21,728 --> 00:03:22,496
it actually works with stocks o funds

69
00:03:23,776 --> 00:03:25,056
Internet is yours

70
00:03:25,312 --> 00:03:25,824
Best friend

71
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:28,128
And that is why I started saving cash

72
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:29,408
Because I want to

73
00:03:29,664 --> 00:03:30,688
That one as a beginner

74
00:03:31,712 --> 00:03:33,248
Be able to find easy to read

75
00:03:34,272 --> 00:03:35,040
and easy to understand information

76
00:03:35,296 --> 00:03:36,832
And that's why I started with this one

77
00:03:37,088 --> 00:03:39,648
the youtube channel so we do this in video format

78
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:40,928
So that you can easier

79
00:03:41,184 --> 00:03:43,232
Able to understand how it goes when one

80
00:03:43,744 --> 00:03:44,256
investing their money

81
00:03:44,512 --> 00:03:45,536
And why it is so incredibly important

82
00:03:48,096 --> 00:03:52,960
I know this may be a bit strange video and maybe not usually do but

83
00:03:53,216 --> 00:03:57,824
I just need to say then I need some background about how I actually started

84
00:03:58,080 --> 00:03:58,848
To

85
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:05,504
Not everyone is born with the knowledge of investing their money but also if you are a beginner so

86
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:07,808
Will you learn it only takes some time

87
00:04:08,064 --> 00:04:09,344
But dare to get started

88
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:11,648
Because otherwise you will never learn.

89
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:15,744
Thank you so much for watching this video I hope to see you in the next
