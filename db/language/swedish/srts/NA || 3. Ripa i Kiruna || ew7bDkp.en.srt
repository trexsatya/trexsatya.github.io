1
00:00:01.520 --> 00:00:04.480
-Go on!
 Go on!

2
00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:06.280
Oh, so good!

3
00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:21.800
Burning mountains in the background and a windy Kiruna.

4
00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:26.440
I make a hit in the city that one decided to move

5
00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:29.520
in favor of a mine.

6
00:00:30.520 --> 00:00:32.720
Here you see the heart of the new Kiruna:

7
00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:37.480
The belfry from the old town hall next to the new town hall.

8
00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:42.000
But I'm going to KaalasjÃ¤rvi, some miles outside Kiruna.

9
00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:47.640
I will go on a rip hunt.
 But I'll make a stop on the road.

10
00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:51.640
Thanks so much!
 Bye!

11
00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:57.120
So there, a little pure meat.
 Now I'm completely ready for the mountain.

12
00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:03.680
In the small village with only 34 inhabitants, chef Johan lives with his family.

13
00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:06.720
Here he runs what may be the world's smallest restaurant.

14
00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:09.240
In it we will cook dinner with Ripa.

15
00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:14.120
Hope we get hold of birds and what a lucky thing Johan is a hunter.

16
00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:20.720
- Are you doing a lot of rip?
 - Not as much as before.

17
00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:24.920
We hope we get some dinner.
 Everything hangs on you.

18
00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:28.200
Everything hangs on me - that's good.

19
00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:42.680
This is nice, then.

20
00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:45.440
What do you think about the chances of Ripa?

21
00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:50.840
Right in the area we are going to, Ripa has been good.

22
00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.160
It's just to hope that it lasts.

23
00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:06.880
I feel as embarrassed as the dog.
 Tell me, what happens now?

24
00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:11.000
She is well peppered.
 We will hunt a little rip.

25
00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:15.000
These are a little difficult conditions today, not so much wind.

26
00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:17.640
I feel a little breeze from here.

27
00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:22.520
These are very nice places for rips, they have water, food and protection.

28
00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:25.720
Then when she sets the bird beeping it in my GPS

29
00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:32.280
And then we go to the dog and Johan is completely open to shoot.

30
00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:34.600
Search!

31
00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:55.160
Okay, now she stands.

32
00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:59.360
The dog has set a bird and the hunt is up and running.

33
00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:09.360
Wait there, now.

34
00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:13.040
Now it is exciting.

35
00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:17.520
Yes Yes!
 Come on!

36
00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:22.920
Oh, so good!
 Oh, how good you were!

37
00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:25.560
Oh, how good you were!

38
00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:31.320
- It was almost food in the saucepan.
 -It was close.

39
00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:36.600
It became a boom on the first attempt.
 But the dog Tundra works on.

40
00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:38.680
Soon she stands for bird again

41
00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:43.040
And this time Johan gets a perfect shot.

42
00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:46.160
Great!
 Great, there!

43
00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:52.280
- We will see if we find the rip.
 - Here it lies.

44
00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:56.400
- A nice shot, Johan.
 -Thanks.

45
00:03:56.560 --> 00:03:59.600
Check.

46
00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:06.440
What a hunting day.
 We got some birds.

47
00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:10.560
- We got that.
 - Fun to see the dog work.

48
00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:14.360
So powerful.
 But we don't have time to stand here and enjoy.

49
00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:17.760
- No, we have some guests waiting.
 - I feel a little stressed.

50
00:04:17.920 --> 00:04:23.400
I have a plan, but no finished plan.
 It probably goes brilliant, I think.

51
00:04:25.480 --> 00:04:29.600
Johan has an idea of making a variant of a classic ceasar salad.

52
00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:33.160
It becomes cabbage and rip instead of chicken.

53
00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:36.040
He removes the cabbage from his own greenhouse.

54
00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:39.880
Because it is possible to grow vegetables so far north.

55
00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:43.840
- This looks like physalis.
 --Physalis ...

56
00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:50.760
And a little tomato and cucumber, of course.
 Heaven!

57
00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:57.240
We sit outside your nine square meter restaurant.

58
00:04:57.400 --> 00:05:02.800
It sounds crazy with just four seats.
 How did you think?

59
00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:06.920
It was a period in my career where I felt it was time

60
00:05:07.080 --> 00:05:10.400
To do something other than work for others.

61
00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:15.920
I still wanted to work with food, but not run a large restaurant.

62
00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:19.800
Then it became, it is today.

63
00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:27.240
I cook a more rustic right over open fire:

64
00:05:27.400 --> 00:05:32.240
Forally grilled rip with a broth that I made on the hull.

65
00:05:33.600 --> 00:05:37.240
We can only accommodate two guests in the tiny restaurant.

66
00:05:37.400 --> 00:05:39.600
Hope they like what we have cooked.

67
00:05:39.760 --> 00:05:44.880
A well -stocked cheese from Vuollerim made from milk from mountain cow.

68
00:05:47.760 --> 00:05:52.680
Rotated rip.
 It goes pretty fast, one must be careful with the heat

69
00:05:52.840 --> 00:05:57.160
Not to exceed the rip, but have some nice pink color.

70
00:05:57.320 --> 00:06:00.960
You have to turn a little sometimes.

71
00:06:05.840 --> 00:06:09.320
- Hi, welcome!
 -Hello!
 Welcome!

72
00:06:09.480 --> 00:06:12.240
This way.
 Come in!

73
00:06:16.520 --> 00:06:21.240
Now it is packed in Johan's small restaurant.

74
00:06:23.320 --> 00:06:27.480
- Thanks so much, what a wonderful.
 -How exiting!

75
00:06:27.640 --> 00:06:32.880
I could never have imagined ceasar salad with rip.
 Great!

76
00:06:33.040 --> 00:06:36.720
-It was really good!
 -So good.
 Thank you so much.

77
00:06:36.880 --> 00:06:41.000
- It's really a tasty meat.
 -Yes.

78
00:06:41.160 --> 00:06:46.400
- But it doesn't take over.
 - No, it balances well.

79
00:06:47.440 --> 00:06:52.560
Johan's right was super successful, now I feel an immense stress.

80
00:06:52.720 --> 00:06:55.800
What should they like about my slightly more crazy serving?

81
00:06:55.960 --> 00:07:00.680
But, uh.
 It's just going on a gut feeling.

82
00:07:01.560 --> 00:07:05.160
Here we have a roasted rip

83
00:07:05.320 --> 00:07:08.720
Served with a hot broth flavored with quanne.

84
00:07:08.880 --> 00:07:12.880
It is a chanterelle chill and fire -baked root vegetables

85
00:07:13.040 --> 00:07:16.160
A little sooty mangold and apple.

86
00:07:16.840 --> 00:07:19.320
- Fantastic.
 - Speaking broth.

87
00:07:19.480 --> 00:07:23.520
What a deep and lovely broth you got.

88
00:07:23.680 --> 00:07:26.280
-Very exciting.
 -How fun.

89
00:07:26.440 --> 00:07:28.640
Anyway!

90
00:07:28.800 --> 00:07:31.560
- You may come back.
 -How nice!

91
00:07:31.720 --> 00:07:36.040
Then we should know when you are here, and we will book in.

92
00:07:36.200 --> 00:07:39.160
- They seem satisfied and satisfied.
 -Yes.

93
00:07:39.320 --> 00:07:42.720
- Now we will end with waffles.
 - I usually do, yes.

94
00:07:42.880 --> 00:07:47.960
It is such a wonderful feeling to bake waffles on an open fire.

95
00:07:48.960 --> 00:07:51.600
I think it may go a little to ...
