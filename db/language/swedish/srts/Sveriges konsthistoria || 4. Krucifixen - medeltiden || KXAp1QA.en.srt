1
00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:09.520
Art - or weirdness.

2
00:00:12.040 --> 00:00:17.560
Sweden's art history is part of the huge story of our country.

3
00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:21.120
We will with some impacts show art-

4
00:00:21.280 --> 00:00:25.560
- As depicts changes and creation power.

5
00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:47.480
Between Viking Age and Christianity, our art history takes a huge leap.

6
00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:51.800
New techniques and strong influences from the south -

7
00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:55.840
-In the 12th century artwork like this.

8
00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.240
Hallelujah!

9
00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:00.360
Hallelujah!

10
00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:02.680
Hallelujah!
 Hallelujah!

11
00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:04.920
Hallelujah!

12
00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:08.000
This is top notch -

13
00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:13.360
- In our European art historical canon.

14
00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:17.960
That it is well -preserved polychromy is unique.

15
00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:21.760
A polychromy usually does not last long -

16
00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:27.840
-But do so with the right conditions for these 12th century techniques.

17
00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:35.320
This Jesus figure's polychromy - thus several different colors -

18
00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:39.840
- Has stayed intact for almost 900 years.

19
00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:46.000
The blue color is Lapis Lazuli, noble stone from Amu-Darja in Afghanistan-

20
00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:50.560
-Imported to the Nordic countries in the 12th century.

21
00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:55.600
HemsÃ¶ church is almost unchanged since the end of the 12th century-

22
00:01:55.760 --> 00:02:01.640
- With absid, cows and long houses.
 Crucifix was made on measurement.

23
00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:06.520
We see in the church what an important role it had.

24
00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:21.200
Now Christianity has been seriously broken.
 Churches are built everywhere.

25
00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:26.800
The Jesus image - the crucifix - may cost almost anything.

26
00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:37.920
It is genuine gold that has been used on the lumbar.

27
00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:41.320
It is simply leaf gold -

28
00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:47.280
- As applied with the help of oil.
 An oil gilding with genuine gold.

29
00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:53.800
It is an artistic way of expression that shows the triumphant Christ.

30
00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:56.840
He triumphs over death.

31
00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:02.960
So this is the arc in which we have Jesus placed.

32
00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:07.080
And we note: Jesus lives on the cross.

33
00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:11.040
The eyes are open.
 He looks down at us.

34
00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:26.200
Yes, down here we wear people.
 The ironworks develop in the 12th century.

35
00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:36.000
The church and the king strengthen their power and the population is growing.

36
00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:41.000
If you want to find the art you have to look in the churches.

37
00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:50.800
We have now arrived until the end of the 13th century.

38
00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:55.680
100 years after the crucifix we saw in Hemse.

39
00:03:55.840 --> 00:04:00.400
We are here facing an entire calf group.

40
00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:04.800
The place is the Calvary Mountain where Jesus was crucified.

41
00:04:04.960 --> 00:04:11.600
Calvary group is the same word.
 And here we get the entire release.

42
00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:16.560
We get the background to Jesus' crucifixion.

43
00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:22.640
To the left we see two figures that are naked -

44
00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:26.280
- And stands and munch on apples.

45
00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:30.520
We see how the snake winds around the tree -

46
00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:36.120
- And the head of the snake that has become human.

47
00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:43.040
This figure has a royal crown.

48
00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:47.000
But now many crucifix is changing.

49
00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:51.320
The living Jesus becomes the suffering Jesus.

50
00:04:51.480 --> 00:04:56.320
The crown of thorns, the torture tool, shows up on his head.

51
00:04:58.760 --> 00:05:05.880
When the crown of thorns becomes modern, it happens that you let a such thing -

52
00:05:06.040 --> 00:05:12.440
- And pushes it outside the royal crown, so you get the new one too ...

53
00:05:12.600 --> 00:05:17.440
... it sounds a bit anachronistic - the "fashion detail".

54
00:05:17.600 --> 00:05:22.880
But here Jesus still has the royal crown, as in Hemse.

55
00:05:23.040 --> 00:05:29.920
And this one is made of metal, so it's an exclusive presentation.

56
00:05:30.080 --> 00:05:37.520
On the continent there is occasional crucifix with ring that we have at Gotland -

57
00:05:37.680 --> 00:05:43.800
- But nothing that is as conceptual, as a whole concept, as here-

58
00:05:43.960 --> 00:05:47.200
- What is unique.

59
00:05:50.640 --> 00:05:52.640
