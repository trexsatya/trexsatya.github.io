1
00:00:05,760 --> 00:00:08,920
Being able to ask good questions is an important asset-

2
00:00:09,080 --> 00:00:13,560
-And interest in how nature works has led to many major discoveries.

3
00:00:13,720 --> 00:00:16,880
In all NO subjects you practice formulating questions-

4
00:00:17,040 --> 00:00:20,840
-To be able to conduct systematic examinations.

5
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:25,280
To assess the quality of your work and tell you what you can develop-

6
00:00:25,440 --> 00:00:28,920
-Your teacher always starts from the knowledge requirements.

7
00:00:29,080 --> 00:00:32,920
The knowledge requirements for all NO subjects in grade nine include:

8
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:45,960
Prior to a systematic study, it is important to do a planning.

9
00:00:46,120 --> 00:00:49,120
Identify a variable that you change.

10
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:55,640
Common variables are e.g.
 quantity, temperature, time or pressure.

11
00:00:55,800 --> 00:00:59,080
It is important to just change one variable at a time.

12
00:00:59,240 --> 00:01:02,640
Everything else should be equal, that is, constantly.

13
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:04,840
An example:

14
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:09,040
It is an ice spot just outside the entrance.
 Someone can slip!

15
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:12,400
Yes, we have to remove it as soon as possible.

16
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:17,400
Is there anything in the chemistry room that can make the ice melt quickly?

17
00:01:17,560 --> 00:01:20,960
Salt?
 Roads are salted in winter-

18
00:01:21,120 --> 00:01:24,880
-But there may be some special salt.
 Does regular table salt work?

19
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:28,520
How would you formulate that question-

20
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:33,520
-So that it is possible to do a systematic examination based on it?

21
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:41,680
Then you investigate whether the ice melts or not, but not how fast it goes.

22
00:01:44,920 --> 00:01:47,240
How much salt should you add?

23
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:50,480
That's what we want to investigate.

24
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:53,960
Well, then the investigative question becomes:

25
00:01:57,760 --> 00:02:02,960
Yes, that question works!
 And then the amount of salt becomes a variable.

26
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:05,800
Maybe you have a hypothesis?

27
00:02:05,960 --> 00:02:10,720
My hypothesis is that the ice melts faster the more salt we add.

28
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:14,640
So we need to measure how much water melts for a certain period of time.

29
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:17,520
And how should you measure it?

30
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:21,880
Now you have to do a plan for the investigation.

31
00:02:22,040 --> 00:02:25,320
We take two paper cups and make holes in the bottom.

32
00:02:25,480 --> 00:02:31,480
Then we both fill with 1 cup of crushed ice and place them in larger glass beachers.

33
00:02:31,640 --> 00:02:36,200
We will pour 1 teaspoon salt in one and mix with a glass rod.

34
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:40,840
In the other we pour 3 teaspoons of salt and stir.

35
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:44,840
We will investigate how fast the ice melts, so we have to take time.

36
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:49,840
With a ruler, we shall measure the water level between the mug and the beaker-

37
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,280
-And document how much melts.

38
00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:56,680
You should measure at regular intervals and use time intervals.

39
00:02:56,840 --> 00:02:59,760
Just.
 We were going to document the results-

40
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:05,000
-The our measurement values, in a table.
 We use the timer on my phone.

41
00:03:05,160 --> 00:03:10,960
Every three minutes we will measure the water level in both beakers.

42
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:16,760
We can create a chart as well, to show the results even clearer.

43
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:21,080
Exciting!
 And if your hypothesis seems tam-

44
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:25,160
-How do you know it wasn't a one -off phenomenon?

45
00:03:25,320 --> 00:03:30,680
True.
 We have to redo the survey to be completely safe.

46
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:33,840
We will conduct the same survey twice.

47
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,800
I enter it in planning.

48
00:03:35,960 --> 00:03:39,240
Now we leave the students and the survey.

49
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:44,280
Good questions in NO are formulated so that it is possible to investigate-

50
00:03:44,440 --> 00:03:50,040
-for example.
 that can be answered by measuring or observing changes.

51
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:54,360
Questions that start with "Why" are difficult to answer with surveys.

52
00:03:54,520 --> 00:03:57,520
Then more theory is needed.

53
00:03:57,680 --> 00:04:01,960
A systematic examination should measure one variable at the time-

54
00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:05,120
-And have a plan for how measurement data should be collected.

55
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:09,120
In this example, the amount of salt was examined.

56
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:14,840
Other, e.g.
 the amount of ice, the temperature of the environment, the size

57
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:19,600
-And stirring frequency, was constantly held.

58
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:23,880
The students have a high quality of their planning.

59
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:25,720
The question investigated

60
00:04:25,880 --> 00:04:30,320
-To observing and measuring the result of changing the amount of salt.

61
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:33,440
Students also plan that the experiment is repeated-

62
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:37,800
-And how the survey should be documented.

63
00:04:37,960 --> 00:04:43,200
The study shows that the amount of salt affects how quickly the ice melts.

64
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:46,320
And it happens more when salt and ice are mixed.

65
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:49,280
You could measure the temperature.

66
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:52,800
A survey usually provides new questions to investigate-

67
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:56,320
-And there is always more to learn.

68
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:04,040
