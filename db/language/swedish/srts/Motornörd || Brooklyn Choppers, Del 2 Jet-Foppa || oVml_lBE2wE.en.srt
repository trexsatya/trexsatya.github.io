00:00:20,780 --> 00:00:26,520
We are a whole bunch of Brooklyn Choppers who are playing and playing.

2
00:00:26,520 --> 00:00:31,060
Go home to Foppa and check out.
 He has strange stuff so it's worth a visit.

3
00:00:31,060 --> 00:00:34,460
-Tjena, Douglas.
 Hello Peter.

4
00:00:34,460 --> 00:00:36,900
-Here there were stuff.

5
00:00:36,900 --> 00:00:41,000
Do you think?
 A little crowded I can agree.

6
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:43,140
-But fun stuff.

7
00:00:43,140 --> 00:00:47,260
Yes, I think so.
 However, not my wife.

8
00:00:47,580 --> 00:00:52,035
-What's that?

9
00:00:52,040 --> 00:00:58,100
It is basically an HD engine and a frame in titanium so it should be lightweight and two pulse dick engines.

10
00:00:58,100 --> 00:01:03,780
The same type of pulse dough engines as Hitler's V-missiles during the Second World War with these are scaled down.

11
00:01:03,780 --> 00:01:06,580
-What do you get such an idea?

12
00:01:06,580 --> 00:01:09,080
On the internet there is a lot but ...

13
00:01:09,080 --> 00:01:13,220
... there are a couple of guys who call themselves black hole racing.

14
00:01:13,220 --> 00:01:19,480
They run with a large pulse -cutting scooter at Speed Weekend in Ã…rsunda every winter.

15
00:01:19,640 --> 00:01:24,720
Those guys inspired me to build my own pulse dots.

16
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:30,400
-Do you drive with this?
 This summer it has been resting because the thought burst.

17
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:35,720
It just can't run because it pulls about 8 liters of gasoline per minute.

18
00:01:35,720 --> 00:01:40,700
So I'm not going that far.
 -Haha, understands that it costs a lot to drive.

19
00:01:40,700 --> 00:01:43,700
-It's decent exhaust.

20
00:01:43,700 --> 00:01:48,600
Well, those who have been behind can certify how bad it sounds.

21
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:54,260
It over 180 dB and it is absolutely unbearable.
 It is not possible to stand there even with hearing protection.

22
00:02:05,900 --> 00:02:08,740
I'll fix the order for the summer.

23
00:02:08,740 --> 00:02:14,580
Thinking about mounting it down because it is quite a potent Harley engine to just have as a drag bike.

24
00:02:14,580 --> 00:02:18,020
Then I can use the pulse dick engines for something else.
 But I haven't decided yet.

25
00:02:18,020 --> 00:02:22,620
It is quite complicated, you have to be at least 2 in order to start it.

26
00:02:22,620 --> 00:02:25,120
Then it is a little dangerous.

27
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:30,800
There are 4 high pressure pumps that can handle 230 liters were flowing.

28
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:34,520
But if any gasoline management burst, it will be a disaster.

29
00:02:34,520 --> 00:02:37,880
I was lucky when the tank burst.
 The idea is below the spreaders.

30
00:02:37,880 --> 00:02:42,860
Had it splashing up gasoline on glowing pipes it could have been a fireball.

31
00:02:42,880 --> 00:02:47,860
The temperature increases about 100 degrees per second.
 And when it starts, you have to go right away.

32
00:02:47,860 --> 00:02:51,500
The pulse dirt engine can be up to 10-15 seconds.

33
00:02:51,500 --> 00:02:56,020
I have protective plates, but I can't sit as wide as possible.

34
00:02:56,020 --> 00:02:59,780
The plate is so close to the pipes so the heat is not against so long.

35
00:02:59,780 --> 00:03:04,580
When you stop gas, you have to move your feet from the footpegs.

36
00:03:04,580 --> 00:03:07,640
Otherwise, the heat goes through the leather stand.

37
00:03:07,640 --> 00:03:11,100
-You also has a bike that is a little special.
 This?

38
00:03:11,100 --> 00:03:15,580
Yes it is a smaller pulse seating than the motorcycle.

39
00:03:15,580 --> 00:03:17,960
This one goes 35 km/h.

40
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:32,400
It's fun to go on.

41
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:35,020
-Haha, lovely tube.

42
00:03:35,020 --> 00:03:39,440
-It's a classic 70s limp bike.

43
00:03:39,460 --> 00:03:41,900
Yes an old boy bike.

44
00:03:42,580 --> 00:03:46,700
-How often do you use it?
 On festive occasions.

45
00:03:46,700 --> 00:03:48,580
Does it also draw a lot of soup?

46
00:03:48,580 --> 00:03:52,920
It is so small so it is not so dangerous.

47
00:03:53,020 --> 00:03:57,000
You can run about 2 minutes on 2 liters of gasoline.

48
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:02,060
This is the economic vehicle.
 It sounds most bad and does not go so fast.

49
00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:06,560
-What are you in there?
 I have a jet grill.

50
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:09,540
It is probably Sweden's fastest grill.

51
00:04:09,740 --> 00:04:11,620
This is what it looks like.

52
00:04:12,980 --> 00:04:15,735
You screw it on appropriate ground.

53
00:04:15,740 --> 00:04:20,020
It takes about 30 seconds before it is red.

54
00:04:20,020 --> 00:04:22,560
After 1 minute it is white.

55
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:25,160
Then you have to spin the sausage quickly.

56
00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:28,340
Then it's done.

57
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:36,940
We tried to grill marshmallows but it became very bad.

58
00:04:36,940 --> 00:04:41,520
They all started burning.
 Sugar burns well we noticed.

59
00:04:44,840 --> 00:04:48,540
If you want a quick grill, this is the one you should have.

60
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:06,920
It is environmentally friendly and goes on gas.
 That's probably the only advantage.

61
00:05:07,740 --> 00:05:14,420
-You have snowed in on Jet.
 Yes, it goes fast and sounds fun.

62
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:21,760
-How often do you use the grill?
 That's when the whole Brooklyn Choppers is out at events.

63
00:05:21,760 --> 00:05:25,980
This is fast food, for real!

64
00:05:26,420 --> 00:05:31,760
It gets the surface first but then the sausage must remain to be finished on the inside.

65
00:05:31,760 --> 00:05:35,040
I would not grill pork on the grill.

66
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:40,500
Shall we go into the other room?
 -Do you have more things?

67
00:05:40,820 --> 00:05:45,060
Now you have missed the coffee maker.
 -Do you have a coffee maker.

68
00:05:45,380 --> 00:05:48,760
In this you make 30 cups of coffee in 3 minutes.

69
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:51,160
-Haha, jet coffee.

70
00:05:53,820 --> 00:05:57,780
This one also sounds a lot even when it is so small.

71
00:05:57,780 --> 00:06:00,220
In this coffee pot you see ..

72
00:06:00,500 --> 00:06:05,400
... this is the body and this jet engine.

73
00:06:07,660 --> 00:06:09,520
Simple!

74
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:14,020
We eat and drink coffee fast.

75
00:06:17,640 --> 00:06:19,760
Great!
 Thanks so much.

76
00:06:19,760 --> 00:06:21,440
Thanks!
 -Bye.

77
00:06:21,580 --> 00:06:24,120
-And we'll see you in the next section.
 Yeah!
