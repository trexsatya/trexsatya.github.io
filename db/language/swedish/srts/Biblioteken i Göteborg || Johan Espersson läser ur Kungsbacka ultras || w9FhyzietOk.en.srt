00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:09,840
Hi, my name is Johan Espersson

2
00:00:09,960 --> 00:00:12,460
And I have written the novel Kungsbacka Ultras.

3
00:00:13,820 --> 00:00:16,380
And I read the introduction from it.

4
00:00:22,020 --> 00:00:24,580
We would spend New Year in Paris

5
00:00:26,340 --> 00:00:28,640
Unable to change

6
00:00:29,620 --> 00:00:30,900
A compulsive action,

7
00:00:31,560 --> 00:00:33,860
something one must fulfill

8
00:00:35,620 --> 00:00:37,900
Even though we were no longer a couple

9
00:00:39,880 --> 00:00:43,540
During the Christmas days we had borrowed your dad's house by the sea

10
00:00:43,780 --> 00:00:46,840
While he was with his new fiancee in Roslagen

11
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:52,400
A gray palace overlooking Krokvik's boat docks,

12
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:58,040
the little bird island, and then the empty, vast, horizon

13
00:00:59,140 --> 00:01:03,500
I stood out at the beach edge and filmed the sea with my iPhone

14
00:01:04,240 --> 00:01:06,800
A documentary film about sand

15
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:12,300
The house was really far too big for a lonely man

16
00:01:13,240 --> 00:01:16,220
Only here and there were possessions from his past life,

17
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:19,200
But without any order or system

18
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,800
The walls were bare

19
00:01:24,180 --> 00:01:27,600
In the fridge stood a jar of salt cucumber that had gone out

20
00:01:27,700 --> 00:01:29,880
before he had even moved in

21
00:01:31,380 --> 00:01:35,660
A thick membrane of salt had settled over the panoramic windows

22
00:01:37,760 --> 00:01:42,660
People wandered over the rocks without contours, without faces

23
00:01:44,300 --> 00:01:46,340
We drank off your dad's spirits

24
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:51,220
When the gin first rose in the body we felt happy

25
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:53,660
See so gray the sea is

26
00:01:54,800 --> 00:01:56,600
So gray and motionless

27
00:01:57,960 --> 00:02:00,520
An endless smooth surface

28
00:02:01,300 --> 00:02:04,120
One can miss it for dirty steel

29
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:08,460
When it subsided, we felt a great fatigue come

30
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:11,580
The empty twilight light

31
00:02:14,020 --> 00:02:17,500
The next day took the flight from Landvetter to de Gaulle

32
00:02:18,460 --> 00:02:20,260
It was a strange New Year

33
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:23,240
Everything was abandoned

34
00:02:24,260 --> 00:02:27,680
We looked up at the sky but saw no fireworks

35
00:02:28,300 --> 00:02:30,260
Two women showed up around one corner

36
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:33,600
And when they saw us they screamed and cheered

37
00:02:34,740 --> 00:02:35,840
We screamed back

38
00:02:36,880 --> 00:02:37,900
"Bonne Année"

39
00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:42,040
It felt strange to celebrate the New Year

40
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:46,640
We knew it was going to take us apart

41
00:02:47,460 --> 00:02:49,260
Make us to other people

42
00:02:50,180 --> 00:02:51,740
Make us memories

43
00:02:53,180 --> 00:02:55,880
We walked close to each other, as children do

44
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,300
We found a photo machine

45
00:03:01,100 --> 00:03:03,040
We drank at a bar by a square

46
00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:05,720
We went taxi

47
00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:09,620
The whole trip I tagged on the driver

48
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:12,240
If bad it went for Paris Saint-Germain

49
00:03:13,020 --> 00:03:14,380
In the beginning he laughed

50
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:16,400
But in the end he just stared in front of him

51
00:03:16,420 --> 00:03:18,260
and said “peut —être”

52
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:21,380
We had sex in the hotel room

53
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:24,840
To take in felt strange

54
00:03:26,180 --> 00:03:28,920
I saw a documentary about a French man

55
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:31,620
that went with dog sledding, or what is called,

56
00:03:31,720 --> 00:03:33,120
From Russia to China

57
00:03:34,440 --> 00:03:37,400
He traveled over huge white plains

58
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:40,760
We drank wheat beer out of can

59
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:45,100
We must have fallen asleep at last and when we woke up

60
00:03:45,260 --> 00:03:48,340
showed the TV a talk show led by a child

61
00:03:49,060 --> 00:03:51,360
We dressed up and went out in the cold

62
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:53,740
The business was closed

63
00:03:55,640 --> 00:03:58,540
We had breakfast at a cafe where the waiter got angry

64
00:03:58,700 --> 00:04:01,140
because we did not greet him when we entered

65
00:04:02,140 --> 00:04:05,980
He spoke fast in French and it was hard to perceive everything

66
00:04:07,320 --> 00:04:09,700
He asked if we had a good evening

67
00:04:09,780 --> 00:04:12,920
And when I answered yes he said something about hospital

68
00:04:15,260 --> 00:04:17,480
A man we had taken for an alkis

69
00:04:17,620 --> 00:04:19,940
and that sat and drank beer yellow like juice,

70
00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:22,580
somehow gloomy or pondering,

71
00:04:22,700 --> 00:04:26,480
suddenly got life and began to hand out croissants to the guests

72
00:04:28,380 --> 00:04:31,160
I thought about the women we met on the street,

73
00:04:31,780 --> 00:04:33,320
How we went out on the street to check out

74
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:34,440
In the empty sky

75
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:38,200
We left the cafe

76
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:41,100
We went down Rue Lafayette

77
00:04:42,340 --> 00:04:46,180
Some say it dangerous to fall in love when you are too young

78
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:48,760
Others say just the opposite

79
00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:54,620
I don't know why love feels like such a wrong word

80
00:04:55,740 --> 00:04:58,300
Before I met you, I was a child

81
00:04:59,140 --> 00:05:00,680
A little kid just

82
00:05:02,760 --> 00:05:04,600
We drank to keep warm

83
00:05:05,660 --> 00:05:07,700
Wrapped in lethargy

84
00:05:09,080 --> 00:05:12,400
A borderland between intoxication and ignition

85
00:05:14,140 --> 00:05:17,700
We walked close to each other, shoulder toward shoulder,

86
00:05:18,180 --> 00:05:21,480
But we had already begun the huge work to forget,

87
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:22,820
to erase,

88
00:05:23,300 --> 00:05:26,880
to give way to the new one that would rush out of us

89
00:05:40,740 --> 00:05:43,600
Yes, that was a difficult question.

90
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:49,340
I have said before that I wrote the book

91
00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:51,860
in the explicit and the purpose of

92
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:55,880
Make Kungsbacka a mythological place.

93
00:05:56,600 --> 00:05:59,800
But I mean that I want to make it a

94
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:02,200
Literary place in some way.

95
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:07,360
Then I mean people with upbringing in Kungsbacka

96
00:06:09,020 --> 00:06:12,020
Always experienced when I lived there,

97
00:06:12,020 --> 00:06:13,760
That culture was somewhere else.

98
00:06:14,015 --> 00:06:18,140
That it was not in the municipality, so to speak,

99
00:06:18,140 --> 00:06:20,159
in Kungsbacka municipality.

100
00:06:20,420 --> 00:06:26,300
So this became a way to make it literary, kind of.

101
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:38,160
A great deal is autobiographical and

102
00:06:39,620 --> 00:06:43,100
An yet crucial part of fiction.

103
00:06:43,260 --> 00:06:45,760
It places itself somewhere in between,

104
00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:50,360
As I think many books do.

105
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:52,780
But is like

106
00:06:53,320 --> 00:06:56,060
Not completely loyal with any of the so to speak.

107
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:58,640
It is not entirely loyal with the autobiographical,

108
00:06:58,820 --> 00:07:01,100
But it is not completely fictitious either

109
00:07:01,100 --> 00:07:02,460
Without somewhere in between.

110
00:07:09,980 --> 00:07:14,520
Yes, I have chosen the book's format,

111
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:17,820
It was not a rational choice really.

112
00:07:18,460 --> 00:07:21,860
I got the most feeling in writing that way.

113
00:07:22,820 --> 00:07:25,880
Maybe because I experienced that I

114
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:30,060
In it could catch a certain kind of perception

115
00:07:30,300 --> 00:07:32,400
which is partly about the memory

116
00:07:32,480 --> 00:07:35,140
and how memory loads different images

117
00:07:35,380 --> 00:07:37,460
and that also has to do with

118
00:07:41,080 --> 00:07:42,880
anything

119
00:07:43,580 --> 00:07:46,160
Which is not completely arranged, so to speak.

120
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:50,540
It was a bit that kind of

121
00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:53,380
World and language I want to work in.

122
00:08:01,780 --> 00:08:03,980
Yeah, I may

123
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:07,560
mention two or three,

124
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:10,500
You have infinitely many sources of inspiration so clearly.

125
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:13,900
Many books man

126
00:08:14,520 --> 00:08:18,680
Has brought into one's own literary work.

127
00:08:20,520 --> 00:08:21,800
It has been

128
00:08:22,020 --> 00:08:25,360
Perhaps most inspired by Tua Forsström

129
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:29,260
and her poetry book snow leopard

130
00:08:30,500 --> 00:08:32,920
from late 80s or early 90's

131
00:08:33,100 --> 00:08:34,780
and then well

132
00:08:35,500 --> 00:08:38,780
the elevated factuality of her poetry as I

133
00:08:39,500 --> 00:08:41,700
is very weak for

134
00:08:41,960 --> 00:08:43,740
that has hit me very hard

135
00:08:45,620 --> 00:08:46,980
As I myself have wanted

136
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:49,300
write through in some way.

137
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:55,420
Right at the beginning with Kungsbacka Ultras

138
00:08:55,560 --> 00:08:57,880
so I read a damn against the Pacific Ocean

139
00:08:58,020 --> 00:08:59,580
by Marguerite Duras

140
00:08:59,580 --> 00:09:01,800
which was also such a tremendous experience

141
00:09:01,860 --> 00:09:04,180
Which I think changed worked very much.

142
00:09:04,260 --> 00:09:06,320
And it is well

143
00:09:06,980 --> 00:09:10,340
Type not to weigh for the brutal.

144
00:09:11,640 --> 00:09:13,840
To write very hard

145
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:15,460
And very violent

146
00:09:16,520 --> 00:09:18,560
but still in it

147
00:09:19,540 --> 00:09:21,246
sensual in any way.

148
00:09:21,246 --> 00:09:24,140
So it was very inspired by Duras.

149
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:28,710
Another favorite author that I have

150
00:09:28,710 --> 00:09:30,160
Is Roberto Bolaño

151
00:09:30,420 --> 00:09:33,120
that has written some kind of directory text

152
00:09:33,280 --> 00:09:36,000
Over different people

153
00:09:36,760 --> 00:09:38,400
and things like that

154
00:09:38,400 --> 00:09:42,900
And my book is also some kind of catalog of Kungsbacka.

155
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:48,800
The three I tried to bake into something "west coast".

156
00:09:55,700 --> 00:09:59,380
Right now, Carina Rydberg is actually reading, in fact, reading Carina Rydberg

157
00:09:59,540 --> 00:10:01,600
The highest throw.

158
00:10:02,580 --> 00:10:05,380
It has started well, I have not come that far.

159
00:10:05,540 --> 00:10:07,000
I'm reading it right now.

160
00:10:07,220 --> 00:10:09,960
A book that I have recently read that I liked very much was

161
00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:12,740
Manhattan by Zara Kjellner

162
00:10:13,900 --> 00:10:17,920
Which was really a nice book that has come now in recent years.

163
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:20,200
The two I recommend.

164
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:31,060
For your own part, the literature is crap important

165
00:10:31,140 --> 00:10:33,120
I don't know what I would have done otherwise.

166
00:10:34,020 --> 00:10:35,540
I had well been

167
00:10:35,720 --> 00:10:38,800
The material manager in any local football team type.

168
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:44,160
Yes, World Book Day,

169
00:10:44,340 --> 00:10:46,400
I didn't really know it.

170
00:10:46,820 --> 00:10:48,620
I think the culture has

171
00:10:48,900 --> 00:10:52,820
Overall have a fairly marginalized status like that

172
00:10:53,060 --> 00:10:56,800
anything that can highlight it is probably pretty good just because

173
00:10:57,800 --> 00:11:00,300
I very much believe in art

174
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:02,838
and on literature as a very specific

175
00:11:02,840 --> 00:11:04,940
artistic experience like that there

176
00:11:06,620 --> 00:11:09,700
As one gets just through books and

177
00:11:09,951 --> 00:11:13,535
that has a lot to give to people.
