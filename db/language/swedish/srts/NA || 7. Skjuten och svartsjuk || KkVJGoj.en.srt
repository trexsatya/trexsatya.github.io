1
00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:09.720
-How are you?
 -What do you think?

2
00:00:09.880 --> 00:00:17.360
I feel dizzy and feverish.
 Now they will operate at two.

3
00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:24.400
Operate?
 You just got a scratch off that rifle ball in the ham?

4
00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:32.160
The body is well in shock, or it is blood poisoning.

5
00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:40.160
Yes ... Elin told you not to shoot at the can in front of the stone.

6
00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:45.120
- It can be rich schett.
 - Burk devil!

7
00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:56.520
It was your fault.
 You set the can obliquely.
 Now I stay here for a long time.

8
00:00:56.680 --> 00:01:01.400
They said I could pick you up at three.

9
00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:07.520
You know how it is.
 Once they cut into the body, they find other diseases.

10
00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:14.600
In such an old body it can be anything.
 I feel a lump.

11
00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:19.400
-Can I see?
 - Don't pill!

12
00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:26.600
There will be a lot to fix in the yard for you when I'm gone.

13
00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:32.720
- Remember to check the boiler.
 - I keep track of that.

14
00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:36.400
Turn off the stove when you leave home.

15
00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:42.520
Now we have no home insurance, Billy.
 Check twice when boiling coffee.

16
00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:46.240
Maybe I should write this down.

17
00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:51.760
Lets see.

18
00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:58.240
- The boiler ... look if the post has come.

19
00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:00.640
The mail.

20
00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:05.880
Take a praise down to the swamp and witness the traps.

21
00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:10.200
Check out the traps in the swamp ...

22
00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:13.400
And dress warm, Billy.

23
00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:18.520
If you also end up here, no one can take care of the yard.

24
00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:24.680
- Dress me warmly ... - you don't have to write that!

25
00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:28.720
Cough attack

26
00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:31.040
-How is it?
 Should I shout on someone?
 -No.

27
00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:37.960
They say that I will not stress myself too much.
 Go and fix the yard.

28
00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:47.280
Okay.
 You should not have to worry about the farm, Leif.
 I arrange everything.

29
00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:51.480
Get on you, the brother.
 Talk to you soon.

30
00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:56.240
Hello then, Billy.

31
00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:14.000
Should the little brother take care of the yard just by itself?

32
00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:17.400
- Hi, Billy!
 -Hi Elin.

33
00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:19.880
What the hell?

34
00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:24.080
He is doing all right.
 I'll pick him up.

35
00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:28.240
I'm fine for fucking int 'good!

36
00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:33.600
- But should we go and have a drink for so long?
 -It would be nice.

37
00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:41.000
- I am so damn coffee.
 - Something calls ... It's Leif.

38
00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:43.520
Hi, Leif.

39
00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:49.040
- Hallå, Billy.
 Now it's bad.
 -What has happened?

40
00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:56.240
I was with the specialist.
 It's not good at all.

41
00:03:56.400 --> 00:04:02.200
They say I'm really sick.
 We'll see if I survive the night.

42
00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:10.360
- What are you too sick?
 - Blood poisoning and bird flu.

43
00:04:10.520 --> 00:04:14.960
But shit in it, Billy.
 I can handle myself...

44
00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:18.120
But my God, Leif!

45
00:04:19.960 --> 00:04:25.600
Leif!
 - The doctors say that Leif will not do well.

46
00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:30.920
What?
 After all, he had only got a little scratch.

47
00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:37.480
This is really strange.
 We talk to the doctors.
 Come!

48
00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:51.160
- Here he lies.
 —Leif?
 Hello?

49
00:04:51.320 --> 00:04:55.840
Leif?
 The brother?
 - Are we getting too late?

50
00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:58.960
Give me a sign, at least!

51
00:04:59.120 --> 00:05:03.520
Damn, damn, Billy Ödman, you came back.

52
00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:08.680
- The brother!
 You are alive!
 - I just saw the light.

53
00:05:10.920 --> 00:05:17.360
- What is she doing there?
 - We bumped into each other outside.

54
00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:20.640
What have the doctors said?

55
00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:27.920
It's really bad.
 There are blood viruses, parasites and bird flu.

56
00:05:28.080 --> 00:05:31.040
The body is declining.

57
00:05:31.200 --> 00:05:35.720
Bird flu?
 How did you get it?

58
00:05:35.880 --> 00:05:40.880
It was well through that damn spirit you stopped.

59
00:05:41.040 --> 00:05:44.120
Strange.
 Are there no doctors here?

60
00:05:44.280 --> 00:05:47.240
Elin, go int '!

61
00:05:47.400 --> 00:05:51.760
I don't want more bad messages.
 I just want to fall asleep.

62
00:05:51.920 --> 00:05:56.680
-Do not say so.
 - Now the light comes in the tunnel.

63
00:05:56.840 --> 00:06:00.080
Focus!
 Be with me!

64
00:06:00.240 --> 00:06:05.040
Good, Leif.
 Breathe with the abdomen.
 I will help you.

65
00:06:07.840 --> 00:06:14.000
Leif says he has received the bird flu and that he is dying.

66
00:06:14.160 --> 00:06:19.040
He has only a little metal splits in the ham.

67
00:06:19.200 --> 00:06:22.800
But ... so he doesn't have bird flu?

68
00:06:22.960 --> 00:06:29.880
- Who told you?
 - A doctor who took samples on me.

69
00:06:30.040 --> 00:06:33.320
But it's just me here today.

70
00:06:33.480 --> 00:06:38.760
How can I see the difference?
 It was probably some specialist physician.

71
00:06:38.920 --> 00:06:42.040
Or I hallucinated.

72
00:06:43.960 --> 00:06:47.920
Here it just says that you have splits in the ham.

73
00:06:48.080 --> 00:06:53.120
Just sounded very serious.
 And now...

74
00:06:54.280 --> 00:06:57.760
Leif, how are you, really?

75
00:06:59.960 --> 00:07:05.840
Yes, what should I say?
 It swayes in the skull and the inside measurement is weak.

76
00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:13.640
I am eaten from the inside.
 That light comes all the time against me.

77
00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:20.360
I get to take more samples.
 He remains overnight.

78
00:07:20.520 --> 00:07:26.720
But now ... it still feels pretty good.
 How nice.
 Now everything released.

79
00:07:26.880 --> 00:07:30.520
Billy, you can pick me up at three anyway.

80
00:07:30.680 --> 00:07:33.960
No, you stay here.

81
00:07:34.120 --> 00:07:40.600
Billy, then we pull.
 - You can do your job.
 We hear when you know more.

82
00:07:40.760 --> 00:07:45.760
-Absolutely.
 I'll let you know.
 - Yes, but we ...

83
00:07:48.840 --> 00:07:53.840
Remember to arrange everything in the yard, Billy.

84
00:07:56.440 --> 00:08:04.520
When you touch my arm I get tenderness

85
00:08:05.760 --> 00:08:13.880
When I see how you smile with your beauty

86
00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:19.320
When you say that everything

87
00:08:19.480 --> 00:08:24.120
will be arranged in the end

88
00:08:24.280 --> 00:08:28.680
When I see that you love

89
00:08:28.840 --> 00:08:33.320
I get love

90
00:08:33.480 --> 00:08:42.360
When you lie with me I get close

91
00:08:42.520 --> 00:08:45.080
Satan!

92
00:08:45.240 --> 00:08:50.760
You whisper to me words about faithfulness

93
00:08:50.920 --> 00:08:53.120
What the hell!

94
00:08:53.280 --> 00:08:59.120
When you see all the beautiful in the world as you do

95
00:08:59.280 --> 00:09:02.360
The little brother and I ...

96
00:09:02.520 --> 00:09:05.560
When you give everything you own

97
00:09:05.720 --> 00:09:11.280
I get love

98
00:09:12.640 --> 00:09:15.680
BUSY TONE

99
00:09:25.360 --> 00:09:30.800
Well, you find a new company when the brother is for death.

100
00:09:30.960 --> 00:09:34.040
Cursed, Billy.
 Now it's enough!

101
00:10:20.240 --> 00:10:24.080
Tonight, tonight came and give, come and take

102
00:10:24.240 --> 00:10:27.240
Come and dance with me you are all i want

103
00:10:27.400 --> 00:10:33.080
Nothing we do is tabu nothing stops us now

104
00:10:39.280 --> 00:10:42.640
Damn.
 Leif!

105
00:10:42.800 --> 00:10:45.480
What are you doing?

106
00:10:48.880 --> 00:10:51.920
God, damn ...

107
00:10:54.960 --> 00:10:57.000
Leif!

108
00:11:01.520 --> 00:11:04.800
Tjena, thick-Leffe.

109
00:11:07.520 --> 00:11:12.480
A naked man is a naked man

110
00:11:12.640 --> 00:11:18.840
I dress i dress up naked

111
00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:22.000
Here I am

112
00:11:27.880 --> 00:11:30.440
