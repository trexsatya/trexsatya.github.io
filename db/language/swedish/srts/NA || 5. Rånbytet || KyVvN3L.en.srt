1
00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:19.920
Fy Satan!
 What a fucking weather, Leif.
 Have you been out, right?

2
00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:25.080
Shouldn't we go down and swim?

3
00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:31.320
We can sneak up Andersson's boat and go down to the floating bridge.

4
00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:37.600
What are you saying?
 We can bring the fishing rods and fish a little.

5
00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:44.080
Leif?

6
00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:48.840
Leif, how are you?

7
00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:55.440
God damnit!
 Leif!

8
00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:59.680
How are you?
 Leif!

9
00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:15.600
Your liver values have shot a lot in the ceiling, I see.

10
00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:21.280
-You have to change your way of life.
 -Oh my God...

11
00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:27.280
-Do you just eat a canned potato?
 -Yes.

12
00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:42.920
Poor little boy.
 You should see that it will be preparing soon.

13
00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:48.720
Yes ... I don't think it will work out this time.

14
00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:53.400
Totally fucking broke.
 They will take the house away from us now.

15
00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:56.280
Uh-oh.

16
00:01:56.440 --> 00:02:01.160
-You have to eat more varied diet.
 -OK, I understand.

17
00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:05.960
Print some pills.
 I don't have all day on me.

18
00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:10.160
There is nothing I can do just like that.

19
00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:17.480
Oh my God!
 Did you get your fucking medical certificate in a cheek egg?

20
00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:24.880
Here you have paid taxes all your life, but you get no help.

21
00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:29.680
No, for Leif Öhman you do not spend any resources on.

22
00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:33.960
How did it go?

23
00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:38.520
Yes ... I'll die.
 I'll die, Billy.

24
00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:44.240
-What are you saying?
 You should not die.
 -Do I not?

25
00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:50.240
Do you mean that the women's corner lied?
 Or have you gone and become a doctor?

26
00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:55.440
-Give me a second statement, then.
 -Take it a little quiet.

27
00:02:55.600 --> 00:03:00.280
Calm?
 - Do you also think I should take it easy?

28
00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:04.000
We take the opportunity to take it easy, then!

29
00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:09.800
I don't care about my disgusting liver from Chernobyl, who have been able to heal.

30
00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:14.120
You know what?
 I have also become a communist physician.

31
00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:19.440
Well, then we have a chubby who suffers from chronic obesity.

32
00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:24.920
He looks like an albinogris and completely lacks brain cells.

33
00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:33.520
Well ... sorry.

34
00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:47.240
Bye bye, nice times you get to go wherever you want

35
00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:53.440
But only if you promise it is because you want to

36
00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:59.320
If it is somewhere that you are actually afraid

37
00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:06.400
To let me in yes, then it's not right

38
00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:26.920
You may be able to take my liver.

39
00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:31.120
What should you put in there, then?

40
00:04:33.640 --> 00:04:37.600
Do you know what these pictures have in common?

41
00:04:37.760 --> 00:04:40.280
No.

42
00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:44.640
They are all taken here in Sörbäcken.

43
00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:49.040
I have only left the municipality four times.

44
00:05:00.320 --> 00:05:04.640
I have always loved Sörbäcken, Billy.

45
00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:09.560
But I've always dreamed of traveling and seeing the world.

46
00:05:11.840 --> 00:05:18.120
Imagine how many times you and I have talked about going Finnish boat.

47
00:05:18.280 --> 00:05:24.720
We have.
 We would have our own cabin, eat breakfast buffet and have women ...

48
00:05:24.880 --> 00:05:31.600
Who runs around the kneecaps on us at Karaokken.
 I know.

49
00:05:33.440 --> 00:05:40.000
Now you stand here with a route Dadel to liver and wait for the liaman.

50
00:05:48.880 --> 00:05:55.320
We do, just.
 We just do, Leif.
 Come on!

51
00:05:55.480 --> 00:06:00.120
If it is your dream to travel we will pack and stick.

52
00:06:00.280 --> 00:06:03.920
Wow.
 What a good idea.

53
00:06:04.080 --> 00:06:11.280
We have a debt of 600,000, and it is absolutely fucking empty in the account.

54
00:06:11.440 --> 00:06:18.600
But be sure to book a luxury cruise so we can shop.

55
00:06:18.760 --> 00:06:23.960
You can pay with monopoly money.
 It's run, Billy.

56
00:06:41.840 --> 00:06:47.160
SEK 50,000?
 Even you have to understand that it is not possible.

57
00:06:47.320 --> 00:06:51.800
Okay, I'll put the cards on the table.

58
00:06:51.960 --> 00:06:58.160
Leif is seriously ill.
 I don't know how long he has left to live.

59
00:06:58.320 --> 00:07:05.200
I want to make his last time nice and invite him on a trip.

60
00:07:05.360 --> 00:07:08.280
Please.

61
00:07:09.920 --> 00:07:14.520
I'm sorry.
 There is nothing I can do.

62
00:07:33.480 --> 00:07:36.720
Move you, for fuck!

63
00:07:42.440 --> 00:07:47.360
"Remove you," I said!
 -Okay...

64
00:07:47.520 --> 00:07:50.920
Put down!

65
00:07:51.080 --> 00:07:54.080
Several shots

66
00:07:55.840 --> 00:07:58.400
Damn!

67
00:07:58.560 --> 00:08:02.440
Police ... a ... no!

68
00:08:02.600 --> 00:08:05.680
112!

69
00:08:05.840 --> 00:08:10.480
-Sos 112. -It's a robbery here.

70
00:08:10.640 --> 00:08:13.960
-Where are you?
 -At the bank!

71
00:08:14.120 --> 00:08:16.560
-What bank?
 -On...

72
00:08:16.720 --> 00:08:20.280
To the train station!
 Drive!

73
00:08:33.880 --> 00:08:37.960
Hello?
 Are you still there?

74
00:09:35.360 --> 00:09:41.680
Here is a cutting schedule you can use.
 Burial becomes too expensive.

75
00:09:41.840 --> 00:09:47.000
I don't want to leave you with debts, so you can cremate me in the oven.

76
00:09:47.160 --> 00:09:53.800
-Leif, I've done something stupid.
 -Splace this bastard at 300 degrees.

77
00:09:53.960 --> 00:09:57.560
Stop the head here and it goes well.

78
00:09:57.720 --> 00:10:01.240
For hell, I've robbed a bank!

79
00:10:10.400 --> 00:10:16.000
It was not me who robbed the bank.
 There were two others.

80
00:10:16.160 --> 00:10:23.120
When they were to go, they dropped the bag, and I took it.
 What have I done?

81
00:10:23.280 --> 00:10:28.120
-Where was anyone seeing you?
 -I do not think so.

82
00:10:29.840 --> 00:10:36.080
-It's not possible.
 I'll submit it.
 -But ... stop and evidence!

83
00:10:36.240 --> 00:10:40.160
-Release!
 -It's the bank's money.

84
00:10:40.320 --> 00:10:46.080
No.
 Yes, though ... This is like when you find a wallet.

85
00:10:46.240 --> 00:10:50.880
You can choose whether you want to take the content or not.

86
00:10:51.040 --> 00:10:56.080
-It's a little worse anyway?
 -You are a hero.

87
00:10:56.240 --> 00:11:03.360
You have taken from the rich and given to the poor.

88
00:11:03.520 --> 00:11:07.280
-Are you sure?
 -It's clear.

89
00:11:07.440 --> 00:11:14.720
Trust me.
 You are pure Rama Robin Hood.
 This is a gift from above.

90
00:11:14.880 --> 00:11:19.040
-Do you think?
 -I have had anxiety every night.

91
00:11:19.200 --> 00:11:26.160
I have prayed to the gods, Muhammad, Buddha and all the fucking men.

92
00:11:26.320 --> 00:11:32.000
Here is the reward for all prayers, and you are the envoy.

93
00:11:32.160 --> 00:11:35.760
-Sörbäcken's little Robin Hood.
 -Okay.

94
00:11:35.920 --> 00:11:42.760
-I have goose bumps all over my body.
 -It's damn cool.

95
00:11:42.920 --> 00:11:46.480
It's like being in a movie.

96
00:11:47.320 --> 00:11:51.720
-Where do you want to go?
 -To Stockholm, maybe.

97
00:11:51.880 --> 00:11:55.280
And then the ferry over to Finland.

98
00:12:09.280 --> 00:12:13.880
-Commissioner Hermansson, coffee.
 -Thanks.

99
00:12:30.880 --> 00:12:36.720
So there.
 I take eight logs snuff, and I have refueled the second.

100
00:12:36.880 --> 00:12:41.040
Leif, you may not shop on chalk anymore.

101
00:12:41.200 --> 00:12:43.920
Chalk...

102
00:12:47.280 --> 00:12:53.440
Keep the change.
 Or ... Throw on a mash tray too.

103
00:12:53.600 --> 00:12:56.080
Extra mustard.

104
00:12:57.400 --> 00:13:00.120
Money Talks.

105
00:13:09.240 --> 00:13:12.880
Is it Biggest Loser final in town?

106
00:13:13.040 --> 00:13:18.600
-Tjena, can.
 -And the little pig is included.

107
00:13:19.840 --> 00:13:24.600
Well ... where the hell are you going, then?

108
00:13:24.760 --> 00:13:28.360
We are going on a caravan holiday.

109
00:13:28.520 --> 00:13:34.800
With the mash tray in the highest cut.
 It's going well for the fat brothers now.

110
00:13:37.600 --> 00:13:39.760
Gosh!

111
00:13:44.120 --> 00:13:50.440
Thanks, Leif.
 I needed some gasoline money.

112
00:13:59.160 --> 00:14:03.600
You may have a nice holiday.

113
00:14:11.920 --> 00:14:15.400
Here, take the sausage.
 Take the sausage!

114
00:14:17.040 --> 00:14:19.760
In the Summertime When The Weather is Hot

115
00:14:19.920 --> 00:14:22.680
You can stretch right up and touch the sky

116
00:14:22.840 --> 00:14:28.560
When The Weather's Fine, You got women, you got women on your mind

117
00:14:28.720 --> 00:14:33.440
Have a drink, have a drive go out and see what you can find

118
00:14:46.040 --> 00:14:50.200
-Are you thirsty?
 -Absolutely!

119
00:14:50.360 --> 00:14:53.960
-A to the brother.
 -Thanks.

120
00:14:54.120 --> 00:14:56.160
Fy fuck.

121
00:14:57.800 --> 00:15:01.000
-This is life.
 -Yes.

122
00:15:01.160 --> 00:15:05.360
It won't be better than this.

123
00:15:05.520 --> 00:15:12.040
Shit.
 We stay here until tomorrow, then we go down towards ...

124
00:15:12.200 --> 00:15:16.080
Turn to hell, what a grid.

125
00:15:17.280 --> 00:15:21.600
Satan, what a fucking puma.

126
00:15:21.760 --> 00:15:25.600
Not she, the brain.
 She!

127
00:15:28.440 --> 00:15:32.240
See and learn, Billy.

128
00:15:37.040 --> 00:15:40.280
Servant, brides.

129
00:15:46.880 --> 00:15:50.040
You should greet the neighbors.

130
00:15:50.200 --> 00:15:53.040
-Jasmine.
 -Wind.

131
00:15:53.200 --> 00:15:56.040
Leif.

132
00:15:57.400 --> 00:16:00.560
Fine.

133
00:16:00.720 --> 00:16:05.920
-What do you have plans tonight?
 -We thought about having a barbecue party.

134
00:16:06.080 --> 00:16:12.400
How fun!
 Me and my brother also thought to have a sausage party ... sausage grill party.

135
00:16:12.560 --> 00:16:18.280
So that ... maybe we can merge our sausages?

136
00:16:20.280 --> 00:16:26.920
No thanks.
 We will manage.
 My brother and his friends are coming soon.

137
00:16:27.080 --> 00:16:31.600
-It gets too crowded on the grill.
 -We have its own grill.

138
00:16:31.760 --> 00:16:37.280
But no thanks.
 If you apologize, we'll talk a little private now.

139
00:16:38.560 --> 00:16:41.120
Well.

140
00:16:41.280 --> 00:16:44.120
Thanks.

141
00:16:55.520 --> 00:17:00.240
Yes, the can ... Where was you at the moment of the robbery?

142
00:17:00.400 --> 00:17:07.440
Is there any fucking echo in here?
 After all, I was home watching TV.

143
00:17:07.600 --> 00:17:13.360
-Where is this banknote from, then?
 -Min back pocket.

144
00:17:13.520 --> 00:17:17.640
The banknote has a serial number.

145
00:17:17.800 --> 00:17:23.200
It tells me that it comes from the robbery in Sörbyn.

146
00:17:23.360 --> 00:17:28.160
I got it in gear when I was shopping on the station.

147
00:17:37.120 --> 00:17:42.760
Both you and I know what a little fucking piss rat you are.

148
00:17:42.920 --> 00:17:48.480
I'll put you there for this, whether you want to or not.

149
00:17:53.360 --> 00:17:58.000
-We shall see.
 -We shall see.

150
00:18:15.920 --> 00:18:19.440
-Shit that it should be so.
 -Really.

151
00:18:19.600 --> 00:18:25.840
-Jasse?
 Didn't you buy worn?
 -It's you who would do it.

152
00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:33.280
-No.
 What should we drink tonight?
 -There are some slices left.

153
00:18:33.440 --> 00:18:37.000
What a fucking garbage.

154
00:18:42.360 --> 00:18:47.000
-They have beer.
 -Jasmine, you have to put on the charm.

155
00:18:47.160 --> 00:18:52.040
-Fan either.
 I would rather be without.
 -You have to take one for the team.

156
00:18:52.200 --> 00:18:58.200
Talk to us a little worn.
 Go and talk to us a little bit now!

157
00:19:28.440 --> 00:19:32.600
-What heroes you are!
 -Hello.
 Leif.

158
00:19:32.760 --> 00:19:39.160
-Kalle.
 -You are welcome.
 Here we have stuff.

159
00:19:39.320 --> 00:19:43.200
Hey.
 Kalle.

160
00:19:52.960 --> 00:19:55.960
-Hello?
 -Wo?

161
00:19:56.120 --> 00:20:01.240
-Is anyone at home?
 Do you have a name?
 -Billy.

162
00:20:01.400 --> 00:20:04.240
Tjena, Billy.
 Sit down.

163
00:20:05.320 --> 00:20:08.440
Sit down!

164
00:20:16.160 --> 00:20:19.760
I fuck you recognize you.

165
00:20:24.200 --> 00:20:29.400
-Where did you make the bump anywhere?
 -I didn't do the lump.

166
00:20:33.480 --> 00:20:36.760
Wait...

167
00:20:36.920 --> 00:20:39.480
Now I know.

168
00:20:39.640 --> 00:20:42.640
We attended the bartender school at Kos.

169
00:20:42.800 --> 00:20:46.440
No, I haven't been to anything like that.

170
00:20:46.600 --> 00:20:52.360
I have a strange face, which makes people recognize me.

171
00:20:54.760 --> 00:21:00.240
-Where is it from?
 -Who want the first one?

172
00:21:05.360 --> 00:21:08.320
Glass is crushed

173
00:21:43.360 --> 00:21:46.680
Have you robbed a bank, your fucking?

174
00:21:47.840 --> 00:21:52.600
-Yeah ... do you have any boyfriend?
 -No.

175
00:21:52.760 --> 00:21:57.840
Neither do I.
 No girl.
 I like to be free.

176
00:21:59.840 --> 00:22:04.320
I do not live in celebrity, like any monk.

177
00:22:04.480 --> 00:22:09.520
-I can have sex and stuff.
 -Yeah.

178
00:22:09.680 --> 00:22:15.640
-I have to talk to you, Leif.
 -Not now.
 I converse with Jasse.

179
00:22:15.800 --> 00:22:21.000
-It is important.
 -What is so important?

180
00:22:21.160 --> 00:22:25.400
Have you got hair on the scrotum, right?

181
00:22:25.560 --> 00:22:31.520
Leif, not now.
 This is really important and private shit.
 Come!

182
00:22:31.680 --> 00:22:35.880
Not now, Billy.

183
00:22:36.040 --> 00:22:42.920
He's a little behind.
 Maybe we can merge our parties and travel together?

184
00:22:43.080 --> 00:22:47.680
Someone has taken the bag from the caravan.

185
00:22:47.840 --> 00:22:51.600
Yes, that bag.
 Come.

186
00:22:51.760 --> 00:22:56.000
Fuck off!
 Sorry, I have to ... we'll hear soon.

187
00:23:11.560 --> 00:23:16.560
-What do you mushrooms about?
 -Augoze, Leif.

188
00:23:16.720 --> 00:23:21.280
Billy, what do you mow about?
 What are you doing?

189
00:23:36.200 --> 00:23:39.480
Adrian!
 Start the car!

190
00:23:42.160 --> 00:23:44.160
Billy!

191
00:23:44.320 --> 00:23:49.320
-Jump in the car!
 -What happened?

192
00:23:49.480 --> 00:23:53.880
Cursed, Billy!
 Stop the car!

193
00:23:56.520 --> 00:23:58.520
Cursed!

194
00:24:16.560 --> 00:24:20.160
Billy Öhman!
 Open the door!

195
00:24:22.200 --> 00:24:25.280
-Hello!
 -Quiet.

196
00:24:27.040 --> 00:24:31.800
What the hell are you doing?
 Has it been struck in the brain beam?

197
00:24:31.960 --> 00:24:37.680
-I can explain.
 -I will explain one thing to you.

198
00:24:37.840 --> 00:24:44.120
I am a virgin.
 I have never felt a woman's skin against mine.

199
00:24:44.280 --> 00:24:48.880
-And my brother got a free game!
 -It were the robbers!

200
00:24:49.040 --> 00:24:54.920
-No, she's my soulmate.
 -She didn't.
 Kalle and Adrian, for fuck!

201
00:24:55.080 --> 00:25:01.480
It was they who robbed the bank.
 I saw Kalle's tattoo on the wrist.

202
00:25:01.640 --> 00:25:05.040
They are.
 I know that.

203
00:25:08.960 --> 00:25:13.520
Listen ... You don't cry?

204
00:25:15.640 --> 00:25:19.600
-Do you, Leif?
 -Shucks.

205
00:25:34.360 --> 00:25:40.320
-What should we do now?
 -Give me the pain tablets.

206
00:25:45.920 --> 00:25:49.680
We forgot them.

207
00:25:49.840 --> 00:25:55.520
-forgotten?
 -Yes, they remain at the campsite.

208
00:25:57.520 --> 00:26:02.520
That was exactly what you needed.
 Get the car key here.

209
00:26:02.680 --> 00:26:08.680
-I can drive.
 -You have been running enough.
 Get the car key here.

210
00:26:11.960 --> 00:26:15.440
-Are you sure it was he?
 -Yes.

211
00:26:15.600 --> 00:26:21.680
They pulled away in a blue Volvo, and another gang followed them.

212
00:26:28.880 --> 00:26:31.880
Door knocking

213
00:26:32.040 --> 00:26:36.600
-What quick you were.
 -Polisen, open the door.

214
00:26:38.600 --> 00:26:41.480
Open the door now!

215
00:26:47.480 --> 00:26:50.760
What the hell...?

216
00:26:50.920 --> 00:26:54.360
No, no ... damn!

217
00:26:55.640 --> 00:26:57.640
Hell.

218
00:26:57.800 --> 00:27:00.720
Satan!
 Cursed!

219
00:27:00.880 --> 00:27:04.440
-Billy!
 -Drive, drive, drive!

220
00:27:18.360 --> 00:27:24.640
I didn't get the money with me.
 I'm sorry.
 I panicked.

221
00:27:28.520 --> 00:27:33.880
Sorry.
 I wanted us to get a nice last trip-

222
00:27:34.040 --> 00:27:37.920
-But everything just got shit instead.

223
00:27:40.720 --> 00:27:47.760
Do you know something?
 Although everything happened and we have the cop after us-

224
00:27:47.920 --> 00:27:51.800
-I don't sing a single second.

225
00:27:51.960 --> 00:27:58.600
You tried to do something extra for me.
 It happened, but you tried.

226
00:27:59.840 --> 00:28:06.320
Do you know what the best is?
 That I have been with you, the brother.

227
00:28:08.840 --> 00:28:13.000
Tomorrow we go home to Sörbäcken again.

228
00:28:15.120 --> 00:28:18.920
Gone well, but at home best, the brother.

229
00:28:20.080 --> 00:28:26.440
Yes ... sorry for not losing the innocence, Leif.

230
00:28:28.680 --> 00:28:33.040
-I'm really sorry.
 -It was a joke.

231
00:28:33.200 --> 00:28:36.680
I was joking, do you understand?

232
00:28:36.840 --> 00:28:39.880
Sure I have ... yes.

233
00:28:42.360 --> 00:28:46.720
What are you saying?
 The latter in is a goat cock.
