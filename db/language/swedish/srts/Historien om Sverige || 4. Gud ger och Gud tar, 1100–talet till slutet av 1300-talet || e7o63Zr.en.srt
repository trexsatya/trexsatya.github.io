1
00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:36.400
She will be one of the most powerful Middle Ages.

2
00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:42.840
After this day, people will think that she is in contact with God.

3
00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:50.200
She will be one of the Catholic Church's most important saints.

4
00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:54.280
Known in the world as the Holy Birgitta.

5
00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:12.320
We are in the early Middle Ages.

6
00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:20.320
It starts well, these are good times.
 The Swedes have become Christians.

7
00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:25.280
The economy is booming, the harvests are good and the population is growing.

8
00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:28.400
The Swedish Empire is being built, step by step.

9
00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:36.960
But everything is challenged when times get worse, the climate becomes colder -

10
00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:43.240
- And the plague pulls out and wipes out a third of the population.

11
00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:46.960
Christianity promises eternal life-

12
00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:50.440
- But many people get to meet hell here on earth.

13
00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:01.760
This is the story of our country.

14
00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:06.600
About the people and forces that have shaped it -

15
00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:10.760
- Endure from the ice age until our days.

16
00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:29.600
This is the story of Sweden.

17
00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:46.480
Today, many people do not care that Christmas is about Jesus' birth.

18
00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:50.560
So it was not in the Middle Ages.
 Then faith was strong.

19
00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:55.200
Christmas night was known to be filled with ghosts.

20
00:02:55.360 --> 00:03:01.440
It was said that it was when the boundary between living and dead was blurred.

21
00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:15.560
It is the mid-1100s, and King Sverker is on his way to Santa.

22
00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:22.240
Sverker has been king for over 20 years.

23
00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:27.360
It is a long time for a king in the Nordic countries at this time.

24
00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:33.840
Rarely do you survive as long as king.

25
00:03:58.080 --> 00:04:00.120
/BLEATING/

26
00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:02.120
/LAUGH/

27
00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:14.400
Sverker is murdered by one of his own men.

28
00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:19.360
No unusual fate for a king during the early Middle Ages.

29
00:04:19.520 --> 00:04:22.960
Different great men are constantly fighting for power.

30
00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:27.160
The kings are weak and not very rich.

31
00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:31.640
Sweden is a fairly small kingdom at this time.

32
00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:33.840
The king's power is limited.

33
00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:37.640
Instead, there are great men and bishops who are strong.

34
00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:42.160
In different alliances, they decide who is to become king.

35
00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:48.440
It takes 100 years before the royal power is strong enough and rich -

36
00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:54.720
- To be able to control the whole country and become a real national power.

37
00:04:55.760 --> 00:04:58.160
But we're not there yet.

38
00:04:58.320 --> 00:05:01.960
It is not so important who is king over Sweden.

39
00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:15.840
Instead, God and faith play the greatest role in the lives of people.

40
00:05:17.160 --> 00:05:22.800
Sweden has become Christian.
 Churches are being built around the country-

41
00:05:22.960 --> 00:05:26.120
- And monastery, like this in Alvastra.

42
00:05:28.840 --> 00:05:34.040
With Christianity, the belief will that everyone can have a life after death.

43
00:05:34.200 --> 00:05:39.440
People have been given a new worldview and their lives a new meaning.

44
00:05:49.640 --> 00:05:55.760
In the churches, the priests preach how man should have eternal life.

45
00:05:59.560 --> 00:06:03.080
Christianity gave man new opportunities.

46
00:06:03.240 --> 00:06:09.680
During the Viking Age, only the warriors came to Valhall, a heavenly nest.

47
00:06:11.200 --> 00:06:17.640
Now everyone can have a life after death, if you just follow God's commandments.

48
00:06:22.680 --> 00:06:25.720
Everyone is given the opportunity to get to heaven.

49
00:06:25.880 --> 00:06:29.080
And that becomes your own responsibility.

50
00:06:29.240 --> 00:06:34.800
You get greater responsibility and greater opportunities in this way.

51
00:06:34.960 --> 00:06:40.520
The ideals in society change with the values of the Christian Church.

52
00:06:40.680 --> 00:06:44.240
The poor and vulnerable also have a soul.

53
00:06:44.400 --> 00:06:47.440
You should be humble and include them in society.

54
00:06:50.040 --> 00:06:55.920
The rites in Christianity also mean some news.

55
00:06:56.080 --> 00:06:58.840
There is a lot of magic in them.

56
00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:01.200
Hoc est enim ...

57
00:07:01.360 --> 00:07:07.880
Hoc est Enim Corpus MEM - Hocus Pocus comes from those words.

58
00:07:08.040 --> 00:07:12.040
They were heard in the fair and could not place them.

59
00:07:13.280 --> 00:07:19.520
The priest turns wine and bread into the blood and body of Christ.

60
00:07:21.720 --> 00:07:28.760
The Catholic Church and Christianity affect the Swedes in many ways.

61
00:07:28.920 --> 00:07:35.680
The worldview is changing.
 Christianity explains both heaven and earth.

62
00:07:35.840 --> 00:07:41.280
Society is changing.
 This applies to healing arts, it applies to agriculture ...

63
00:07:41.440 --> 00:07:45.000
... mining.
 Everything, really.

64
00:07:47.040 --> 00:07:51.880
Many people think of the Middle Ages as dark, but that is not true.

65
00:07:52.040 --> 00:07:58.280
During the early Middle Ages, in the 12th century, life is quite good.

66
00:07:58.440 --> 00:08:04.320
The climate is warm and comfortable, the harvesters good, the country is booming.

67
00:08:05.680 --> 00:08:11.720
Maybe you connect this with the new faith and the Christian God.

68
00:08:11.880 --> 00:08:17.400
It seemed that God appreciated hard work and faith -

69
00:08:17.560 --> 00:08:20.600
- And that he heard their prayers.

70
00:08:20.760 --> 00:08:25.760
The people had earned themselves the good times.

71
00:08:25.920 --> 00:08:27.960
God was behind everything.

72
00:08:43.240 --> 00:08:48.360
The good harvests also cause Sweden's population to grow.

73
00:08:48.520 --> 00:08:51.960
They become about twice as many -

74
00:08:52.120 --> 00:08:57.560
- During the first two centuries in medieval Sweden.

75
00:08:57.720 --> 00:09:03.280
Agricultural technology is changing, and we have access to iron.

76
00:09:03.440 --> 00:09:07.720
Then we can improve the tools we work with.

77
00:09:07.880 --> 00:09:13.040
The shovel comes as a tool, you work more with dika ur-

78
00:09:13.200 --> 00:09:16.800
â€“And use chips that one did not use before-

79
00:09:16.960 --> 00:09:21.320
- But now needed to grow food for the entire population.

80
00:09:26.360 --> 00:09:31.680
Increased productivity means that tax revenue for royal power increases.

81
00:09:34.880 --> 00:09:38.240
Over time, it will strengthen it.

82
00:09:38.400 --> 00:09:41.880
The church also serves on the good times.

83
00:09:43.720 --> 00:09:48.520
The church benefits from agriculture expanding and providing surplus.

84
00:09:48.680 --> 00:09:53.520
Here you drum in our first permanent tax - tiondet -

85
00:09:53.680 --> 00:09:59.240
- A tenth of everything is given to the church.
 The basis for our municipal tax.

86
00:09:59.400 --> 00:10:06.560
It took a long time to drum through, but people saw where the riches went.

87
00:10:06.720 --> 00:10:13.040
They were channeled to the church, which could then repair bridges and roads -

88
00:10:13.200 --> 00:10:19.400
- Pay for someone to plug.
 When you saw where it went, it was accepted.

89
00:10:24.480 --> 00:10:30.360
Something new the Catholic Church brings with it is the belief in saints.

90
00:10:30.520 --> 00:10:34.320
Saints are people who are considered sacred after their death.

91
00:10:34.480 --> 00:10:38.080
In the Middle Ages, they are hugely popular.

92
00:10:38.240 --> 00:10:43.000
One of Sweden's first saints will be this woman.

93
00:10:43.160 --> 00:10:49.480
With her life, and dramatic death, she writes in Swedish history -

94
00:10:49.640 --> 00:10:55.240
- And becomes known as Holy Elin, or Saint Helena.

95
00:10:55.400 --> 00:10:58.240
She is still honored today.

96
00:10:59.200 --> 00:11:04.040
She is a rich widow with large properties in the SkÃ¶vdetrakt.

97
00:11:04.200 --> 00:11:10.200
She gives many gifts to the church, and lives a godly life.

98
00:11:11.440 --> 00:11:16.760
She marries one of her daughters, but the marriage is not successful.

99
00:11:16.920 --> 00:11:22.040
Instead, it causes Elin's life to take a violent turn.

100
00:11:22.200 --> 00:11:26.000
The son -in -law abuses Elin's daughter.

101
00:11:26.160 --> 00:11:30.680
In the area you start talking behind Elin's back.

102
00:11:30.840 --> 00:11:37.320
The situation must of course have plagued Elin personally a lot.

103
00:11:37.480 --> 00:11:42.440
But in addition, it is serious for her social position.

104
00:11:42.600 --> 00:11:46.560
She must be able to protect her child.
 How else can she protect the countryside?

105
00:11:46.720 --> 00:11:51.280
/Tormented screams and angry cries/

106
00:12:40.320 --> 00:12:45.920
When the son -in -law is murdered, Elin is suspected of being behind his death.

107
00:12:48.200 --> 00:12:51.800
Whether she is guilty or not, we do not know.

108
00:12:51.960 --> 00:12:58.040
Shortly after the murder, Elin leaves on a pilgrimage, and is away for a long time.

109
00:13:00.600 --> 00:13:03.480
Pilgrimage trips, as well as crusades -

110
00:13:03.640 --> 00:13:07.920
- to search for sacred places, wander in the footsteps of Jesus -

111
00:13:08.080 --> 00:13:14.120
- Is a spiritual investment in life after this and one's own bliss.

112
00:13:14.280 --> 00:13:20.840
Elin is one of the first Swedes to visit Holy Jerusalem.

113
00:13:39.840 --> 00:13:44.240
Elin is gone for almost two years before she returns home.

114
00:13:58.760 --> 00:14:04.240
The son -in -law's family is still said to suspect Elin for the murder.

115
00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:19.160
Shortly after Elin's return, a church will be opened nearby.

116
00:14:19.320 --> 00:14:24.560
Elin has donated money to the building, and moves to the inauguration.

117
00:14:32.920 --> 00:14:36.200
But she never arrives.

118
00:15:22.600 --> 00:15:28.920
According to the story, it is the son -in -law's family that ensures that Elin is killed.

119
00:15:30.600 --> 00:15:35.280
A water source is said to break forward at the site where she is murdered -

120
00:15:35.440 --> 00:15:38.600
- And it is followed by more miracles.

121
00:15:38.760 --> 00:15:42.960
Soon Elin will be declared.

122
00:15:43.120 --> 00:15:48.640
With his pious life, the gifts to the church, the pilgrimage to Jerusalem -

123
00:15:48.800 --> 00:15:52.880
- And since the awful death, Elin was a perfect saint.

124
00:15:53.040 --> 00:15:57.560
Then she becomes a great spiritual resource for her survivors -

125
00:15:57.720 --> 00:16:03.560
- As a saint in the family.
 And SkÃ¶vdebygden gets a saint.

126
00:16:03.720 --> 00:16:07.960
Saint, miracles, sacred relics, spiritual wonders -

127
00:16:08.120 --> 00:16:11.160
- Are big during this era.

128
00:16:11.320 --> 00:16:16.360
Not everyone can afford Jerusalem, but you can go to SkÃ¶vde.

129
00:16:39.440 --> 00:16:45.280
It was to this church in GÃ¶tene that Elin was on her way when she was murdered.

130
00:16:45.440 --> 00:16:48.640
In here, something unusual is hidden.

131
00:17:09.960 --> 00:17:15.120
In the altar, a shrine has been walled since the Middle Ages.

132
00:17:22.680 --> 00:17:28.320
In it, Elin's finger is said to lie, wrapped in linen fabric.

133
00:17:29.480 --> 00:17:34.920
In the stories of Elin a blind man stroked his finger over his eyes -

134
00:17:35.080 --> 00:17:37.840
- And got the sight back.

135
00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:42.320
This little skeleton part is thus a relic.

136
00:17:44.960 --> 00:17:48.040
In the Middle Ages, relics were worth gold.

137
00:17:48.200 --> 00:17:51.440
They were said to cure diseases and protect against evil.

138
00:17:51.600 --> 00:17:57.480
The person or institution that had a chip from the Holy Cross-

139
00:17:57.640 --> 00:18:01.880
-A tag from Jesus' thorn crown or a finger joint from a saint -

140
00:18:02.040 --> 00:18:08.000
- Kundde is happy.
 Then they stood under the protection of a saint.

141
00:18:08.160 --> 00:18:12.240
Where the relics were there, it was also believed that the saints were.

142
00:18:14.960 --> 00:18:21.280
The relationship with a saint could be more personal than the one to God.

143
00:18:21.440 --> 00:18:25.680
As a saint, women can also be revered in the same way as men.

144
00:18:25.840 --> 00:18:29.680
But this ends with the Reformation in the 16th century.

145
00:18:29.840 --> 00:18:35.480
Then the saint worship is banned, and relics are destroyed throughout the country.

146
00:18:35.640 --> 00:18:40.360
But Elin's finger was rescued and walled into the altar.

147
00:18:40.520 --> 00:18:45.880
As one of Sweden's earliest saints, she is present today.

148
00:18:46.040 --> 00:18:49.040
SkÃ¶vde has her on her city weapon.

149
00:18:49.200 --> 00:18:53.240
Here you still honor her in the Catholic congregation.

150
00:18:59.360 --> 00:19:05.280
Christianity affects both faith, everyday life and the whole of Sweden's development.

151
00:19:07.320 --> 00:19:14.000
With the Catholic Church comes the monasteries, and with them new knowledge.

152
00:19:18.840 --> 00:19:24.440
In the monasteries you sit and write, you study.

153
00:19:24.600 --> 00:19:30.120
You develop what we call science today.

154
00:19:31.400 --> 00:19:38.120
The monasteries offer the only training of the time, the center of knowledge.

155
00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:46.720
You start using Latin, and then you can communicate across national borders.

156
00:19:47.600 --> 00:19:53.000
The monasteries and the church in Sweden exchange letters with the Pope Church in Rome.

157
00:19:53.160 --> 00:19:56.360
Now we can follow Sweden's history in text.

158
00:19:56.520 --> 00:20:00.640
The letters say that Sweden gets its first archbishop -

159
00:20:00.800 --> 00:20:04.640
- Out of the Pope in 1164.

160
00:20:04.800 --> 00:20:09.040
With the appointment, Sweden is recognized by the Catholic Church -

161
00:20:09.200 --> 00:20:13.560
- As a private Christian kingdom with its own Swedish kings.

162
00:20:13.720 --> 00:20:20.520
Many historians believe that it is now Sweden becomes a kingdom to be expected.

163
00:20:20.680 --> 00:20:25.640
The church is involved in the national formation of Sweden.

164
00:20:33.120 --> 00:20:37.960
In the Swedish forests, in the bedrock, something - hides - hides -

165
00:20:38.120 --> 00:20:43.080
- As over time, Sweden contributes to a national power:

166
00:20:43.240 --> 00:20:45.600
The iron ore.

167
00:20:47.440 --> 00:20:52.040
The trade in the iron over time makes the royal power richer -

168
00:20:52.200 --> 00:20:57.040
- So the king, step by step, can increase his control over the kingdom.

169
00:20:57.200 --> 00:21:00.640
The blast furnaces extract the iron from the ore.

170
00:21:00.800 --> 00:21:05.080
We are probably the first in Europe to develop the blast furnaces.

171
00:21:10.840 --> 00:21:15.800
They make iron to such an extent that there will be a large -scale industrial -

172
00:21:15.960 --> 00:21:19.040
- Which is important in Sweden today.

173
00:21:21.920 --> 00:21:29.320
When we start using the blast furnace, we can melt rock ore.

174
00:21:29.480 --> 00:21:36.160
We can have a continuous production, without having to stop the oven.

175
00:21:37.880 --> 00:21:44.360
We go from zero production to maybe upwards of 300 tonnes per year -

176
00:21:44.520 --> 00:21:50.920
- On only maybe 150 years.
 The development is going very fast.

177
00:21:57.600 --> 00:22:03.760
You have a production where people move up to Bergslagen.

178
00:22:06.720 --> 00:22:11.440
They get work there, they receive pay.

179
00:22:11.600 --> 00:22:14.960
We get a type of monetary system.

180
00:22:16.920 --> 00:22:21.160
Bergslagen is almost the first to develop just wage work.

181
00:22:21.320 --> 00:22:26.840
When working in agriculture you were often paid in food and shelter.

182
00:22:27.000 --> 00:22:30.640
But here you got paid in money.

183
00:22:30.800 --> 00:22:35.400
Here we meet both women and children as labor -

184
00:22:35.560 --> 00:22:40.440
- When it comes to crushing the ore down to thumb size.

185
00:22:44.360 --> 00:22:47.240
One builds an entire network -

186
00:22:47.400 --> 00:22:55.040
- With coaling, blast furnace operation, mining, exports and trade.

187
00:22:58.960 --> 00:23:03.520
The blast furnaces cause the forests in Bergslagen to be populated.

188
00:23:03.680 --> 00:23:07.560
Many move here to get rich in the iron production.

189
00:23:07.720 --> 00:23:14.560
The demand for iron in Europe is high and trade is very profitable.

190
00:23:14.720 --> 00:23:20.960
Over time, the blast furnace owners form a new class of society - the mountain men.

191
00:23:22.520 --> 00:23:28.840
When it comes to the blast furnace mill and working on getting iron -

192
00:23:29.000 --> 00:23:34.360
- So there is no older dated blast furnace in Europe -

193
00:23:34.520 --> 00:23:38.520
- It is outside Norberg, in Lapphyttan.

194
00:23:38.680 --> 00:23:43.840
Based on what we know today we are first in Europe.

195
00:24:18.760 --> 00:24:21.640
In the winter, the watercourses freeze.

196
00:24:21.800 --> 00:24:25.280
The blast furnaces go out when the drive wheels stop.

197
00:24:33.080 --> 00:24:37.560
But in the smiths, the mountain men continue their work.

198
00:25:50.200 --> 00:25:54.440
When it is dark and cold, there is less to be done on the farms.

199
00:25:54.600 --> 00:25:58.560
Then you take the opportunity to celebrate holidays.

200
00:26:03.000 --> 00:26:08.240
The church is a gathering place at baptism, funeral and wedding -

201
00:26:08.400 --> 00:26:12.960
- And both the church and the cemetery also serve as a party room.

202
00:26:16.880 --> 00:26:23.560
It is the duty of the great men to stand for party and spectacle.

203
00:26:23.720 --> 00:26:27.400
They should bid on food and drink, and be generous.

204
00:26:27.560 --> 00:26:33.720
It is also the duty of the church.
 Church and great men stand for the public.

205
00:26:33.880 --> 00:26:38.320
They should be generous, especially at major holidays.

206
00:26:39.680 --> 00:26:46.440
Weddings, funerals and holidays were celebrated in the church with ceremonies -

207
00:26:46.600 --> 00:26:51.800
- But also with dance and music and a lot of beer.

208
00:26:54.280 --> 00:26:57.600
It took time for the Swedes to be sedated in the church.

209
00:26:57.760 --> 00:27:01.040
Historical sources say that they drank Christmas.

210
00:27:01.200 --> 00:27:05.600
In medieval calendars, the holidays had been engraved with symbols.

211
00:27:05.760 --> 00:27:08.920
For Christmas, there was a beer stop.

212
00:27:11.240 --> 00:27:14.880
/Joint song/

213
00:27:24.960 --> 00:27:30.200
What the word Christmas has does not know.
 It goes a long way back.

214
00:27:30.360 --> 00:27:35.840
But the Urethian word Juhla probably meant that they were partying.

215
00:27:36.000 --> 00:27:39.960
/Music and Song/

216
00:28:06.920 --> 00:28:11.840
Holidays were of great importance, they had a supernatural touch.

217
00:28:12.000 --> 00:28:14.680
Crime was also punished harder.

218
00:28:14.840 --> 00:28:21.960
There were higher fines for murder and other crimes during holidays, like Christmas.

219
00:28:22.120 --> 00:28:27.880
You could be sentenced to peacelessness and forced to leave everything behind.

220
00:28:44.080 --> 00:28:47.080
/Suffocated sound/

221
00:29:07.400 --> 00:29:10.080
/CRY/

222
00:29:17.200 --> 00:29:22.160
If you are guilty of murder or murder during Christmas, and want to survive -

223
00:29:22.320 --> 00:29:28.600
- Make it to get as far away as possible.
 Maybe even abroad.

224
00:29:29.920 --> 00:29:34.080
People in the early Middle Ages were more moving than we usually think.

225
00:29:34.240 --> 00:29:37.320
It was easy to follow the old trade routes -

226
00:29:37.480 --> 00:29:42.680
- And you could move to cities, which increased in number during the period.

227
00:29:44.360 --> 00:29:48.400
People moved into the cities a little everywhere.

228
00:29:52.440 --> 00:29:56.920
Lund is already an established city in the late 12th century-

229
00:29:57.080 --> 00:30:00.120
- But it belongs to Denmark, not Sweden.

230
00:30:01.960 --> 00:30:08.000
There were more in the cities as interregional trade increased.

231
00:30:08.160 --> 00:30:11.920
The raw material volumes are increasing, and consumption is increasing.

232
00:30:12.080 --> 00:30:17.600
It becomes a much greater volume to both intensity and quantity.

233
00:30:17.760 --> 00:30:23.480
It pulls people into the cities, a lot from other countries.

234
00:30:23.640 --> 00:30:29.240
People who speak German, Englishmen, Slavic guests as well.

235
00:30:31.880 --> 00:30:36.920
All trade in the cities is also profitable for the Kings of Middle Ages.

236
00:30:37.080 --> 00:30:41.360
The king promises to protect the cities against attackers.

237
00:30:41.520 --> 00:30:46.400
For that, the royal power receives taxes and customs fees from the inhabitants.

238
00:30:57.680 --> 00:31:01.400
Residents are allowed to solve waste management and sewer.

239
00:31:01.560 --> 00:31:04.560
They certainly did their best, because purity was important.

240
00:31:04.720 --> 00:31:10.880
But a saying said that you felt the stench of a city before you saw it.

241
00:32:17.640 --> 00:32:22.520
Injuries and illnesses could be treated by doctors and heroes.

242
00:32:25.280 --> 00:32:30.280
One could treat wounds, cut up and sew the ulcers -

243
00:32:30.440 --> 00:32:34.080
â€“And you could cure fractures.

244
00:32:34.240 --> 00:32:40.880
In fact, most fractures have healed as well as a fracture today.

245
00:32:46.120 --> 00:32:51.960
Excavations in Lund have found veins, scalpels -

246
00:32:52.120 --> 00:32:55.840
- Surgery pliers and other surgical instruments.

247
00:32:56.000 --> 00:32:59.240
The best care was given at a monastery.

248
00:32:59.400 --> 00:33:03.320
Monks and nuns brought with them medical knowledge from the continent.

249
00:33:03.480 --> 00:33:07.520
There was also an experience -based medical knowledge -

250
00:33:07.680 --> 00:33:12.800
- As often inherited, and was a little anywhere in society.

251
00:33:14.640 --> 00:33:20.280
The medieval knowledge of how the body works has its limitations.

252
00:33:20.440 --> 00:33:26.000
There are some standard methods used for all possible diseases.

253
00:33:26.160 --> 00:33:29.760
One of the most popular is vein.

254
00:33:31.840 --> 00:33:37.600
The logic behind it was that the body must be at healthy fluids.

255
00:33:37.760 --> 00:33:41.720
It was believed that diseases were generated by imbalance between the fluids:

256
00:33:41.880 --> 00:33:45.080
Yellow bile, black bile, mucus and blood.

257
00:33:45.240 --> 00:33:52.080
By reducing it that it was too much of, the disease symptoms decreased.

258
00:33:52.240 --> 00:33:57.640
So vein was a universal remedy to make the sick healthy.

259
00:34:03.280 --> 00:34:08.640
Cities change over time.
 New houses are being built where old ones stood.

260
00:34:12.800 --> 00:34:17.880
This church ruin is located under a contemporary pub in central Lund.

261
00:34:21.880 --> 00:34:26.920
That is what is left of a church built in the early Middle Ages.

262
00:34:29.080 --> 00:34:32.120
Next to the church was the cemetery.

263
00:34:32.280 --> 00:34:35.240
The legs buried here-

264
00:34:35.400 --> 00:34:41.280
-Can be told a lot about what it was like to live in Lund in the 12th century.

265
00:34:41.440 --> 00:34:48.800
In the Lund material I have examined just over 4,500 skeletons.

266
00:34:48.960 --> 00:34:52.120
After all, people have lived in the city.

267
00:34:52.280 --> 00:34:55.720
For example, we have some bone fractures -

268
00:34:55.880 --> 00:35:02.240
- This can be linked to the construction when the city expanded.

269
00:35:02.400 --> 00:35:08.720
People have fallen, squeezed.
 We see fractures and other types of damage.

270
00:35:12.520 --> 00:35:18.840
One of the skeletons testifies that the art had its shortcomings.

271
00:35:19.000 --> 00:35:25.280
This person, a man, has broken the femur just above the knee.

272
00:35:25.440 --> 00:35:32.080
They have tried to help him.
 He could not support on the femur -

273
00:35:32.240 --> 00:35:38.720
- So you have tied up the lower leg behind him, and then he had crutches.

274
00:35:38.880 --> 00:35:43.600
But this binding of the leg has lasted so long -

275
00:35:43.760 --> 00:35:47.600
â€“So when it was time to remove it -

276
00:35:47.760 --> 00:35:51.880
- Had the kneecap simply stuck in that position.

277
00:35:52.040 --> 00:35:56.680
So he could never support the leg again, but had crutches life.

278
00:36:04.600 --> 00:36:07.440
Lund is a Christian city.

279
00:36:07.600 --> 00:36:12.280
Christianity has strong perceptions of what is sinful and not.

280
00:36:13.920 --> 00:36:17.320
The rules can hit women hard.

281
00:36:17.480 --> 00:36:21.280
Especially if you become pregnant without being married.

282
00:36:21.440 --> 00:36:27.560
Young women are exposed.
 Christianity prohibits sex outside of marriage.

283
00:36:27.720 --> 00:36:32.800
Unmarried women who become pregnant are not just a moral problem.

284
00:36:32.960 --> 00:36:37.720
An extra -marital child draws disgrace throughout the family.

285
00:36:43.600 --> 00:36:50.040
During an excavation of a house in Lund, an unexpected finding is made.

286
00:36:51.640 --> 00:36:56.480
Inside the house, something has buried an infant in secret.

287
00:36:56.640 --> 00:36:59.760
We had been digging for a while.

288
00:36:59.920 --> 00:37:05.160
When small, small legs showed up, I recognized it - a small child.

289
00:37:05.320 --> 00:37:09.680
It was right next to the hearth in the house.

290
00:37:11.840 --> 00:37:16.680
The child must have been born in secret, inside the house.

291
00:37:16.840 --> 00:37:21.160
It deviates from norms and ethics during this time.

292
00:37:38.000 --> 00:37:41.920
Respect for the children was great.

293
00:37:42.080 --> 00:37:48.120
It is seen among stillborn children that they were taken care of according to the laws.

294
00:37:53.840 --> 00:37:59.760
In all likelihood, the child is both born and buried in secret.

295
00:37:59.920 --> 00:38:05.440
We do not know the background, but probably the family wanted to avoid disgrace.

296
00:38:05.600 --> 00:38:10.320
It is a sign of how hard one looked at extra -marital children -

297
00:38:10.480 --> 00:38:16.440
- And how vulnerable unmarried women were when they became pregnant.

298
00:38:30.640 --> 00:38:35.720
When we enter the 13th century, Finland has become part of Sweden.

299
00:38:38.480 --> 00:38:41.440
Sweden does not conquer Finland.

300
00:38:41.600 --> 00:38:46.880
It is Finland who chooses to become part of the Swedish Empire.

301
00:38:47.040 --> 00:38:50.600
The Finns are not many, maybe 50,000 people.

302
00:38:50.760 --> 00:38:55.280
They feel threatened by the Russians who are growing strong in the east.

303
00:38:55.440 --> 00:39:02.040
By paying taxes to Sweden, they buy security and protection.

304
00:39:03.760 --> 00:39:07.120
You can see it as a win-win situation.

305
00:39:07.280 --> 00:39:13.640
Sweden gets new taxpayers, you get a buffer zone in the east.

306
00:39:13.800 --> 00:39:18.200
Finns get the security they realize they need.

307
00:39:18.360 --> 00:39:24.720
Finland is a good deal for Sweden.
 During the good times of the 13th century-

308
00:39:24.880 --> 00:39:30.120
- The Swedish royal power is growing increasingly richer and stronger.

309
00:39:31.320 --> 00:39:35.200
The good harvests of the farmers, the trade in iron, and the new cities -

310
00:39:35.360 --> 00:39:39.800
- For increased revenue for the royal power through customs and taxes.

311
00:39:39.960 --> 00:39:45.080
The king lives well on what the Swedish people perform.

312
00:39:45.240 --> 00:39:49.720
But now the king is starting to be able to give back something.

313
00:39:49.880 --> 00:39:55.520
The time when the Swedish kings do not play any role is soon over.

314
00:39:55.680 --> 00:39:59.480
The one who will change it is called Birger Jarl.

315
00:40:02.200 --> 00:40:05.400
Birger Jarl is a cunning and skilled power player.

316
00:40:05.560 --> 00:40:12.560
He can be cruel and violent, but is good at building alliances.

317
00:40:12.720 --> 00:40:18.680
Birger never becomes king himself, but he is the king's closest man -

318
00:40:18.840 --> 00:40:22.520
- And he decides through the king.

319
00:40:22.680 --> 00:40:27.960
What Birger wants, is to make the Swedish kingdom strong and stable.

320
00:40:34.160 --> 00:40:38.240
Birger Jarl, an important name in Swedish history.

321
00:40:38.400 --> 00:40:44.440
By the middle of the 13th century, he lets build a fortress here at Helgeandsholmen.

322
00:40:44.600 --> 00:40:49.040
The purpose is to prevent the pirates on the Baltic Sea from entering Lake MÃ¤laren.

323
00:40:49.200 --> 00:40:54.800
Here Stockholm is now formed, which far later becomes the capital in Sweden.

324
00:40:54.960 --> 00:41:01.160
But Birger Jarl has just begun.
 He has grand plans for Sweden.

325
00:41:02.840 --> 00:41:09.480
Birger Jarl has great power, and he works to strengthen the royal power.

326
00:41:09.640 --> 00:41:14.880
He executes opponents who can claim the Swedish throne.

327
00:41:15.040 --> 00:41:21.680
If you avoid constant power struggle for the throne, then it will be stability.

328
00:41:21.840 --> 00:41:29.040
He understands that he has to bring the people with him to get through this.

329
00:41:29.200 --> 00:41:32.760
And what the people need is security.

330
00:41:32.920 --> 00:41:37.160
Security can be created with law and order.

331
00:41:37.320 --> 00:41:42.080
The previous laws were different depending on where they lived in the kingdom.

332
00:41:42.240 --> 00:41:46.640
Birger Jarl creates uniform laws called peace laws.

333
00:41:46.800 --> 00:41:50.040
They aimed to create just peace.

334
00:41:51.720 --> 00:41:58.040
Birger Jarl's laws were followed by district negotiations around the kingdom.

335
00:42:08.840 --> 00:42:13.480
The laws were read by local lawmen who represented the king.

336
00:42:13.640 --> 00:42:19.440
There is a lot of evidence that people knew laws and regulations.

337
00:42:24.880 --> 00:42:29.840
As the cities are emerging, the penalty becomes harsher.

338
00:42:30.000 --> 00:42:34.840
It is easier to judge someone you do not know of harsh punishment.

339
00:42:36.880 --> 00:42:42.440
The punishment could be a shame - it would appear that you were a criminal.

340
00:42:42.600 --> 00:42:45.440
A thief could have the ear cut off.

341
00:42:45.600 --> 00:42:51.480
An unfaithful woman could have her hair cut off, or her nose cut off.

342
00:42:52.920 --> 00:42:58.840
One of the most nasty punishment must be to be stepped.

343
00:42:59.000 --> 00:43:05.200
First counseled - man mashes man, cracking the bones in the body -

344
00:43:05.360 --> 00:43:11.360
- And then you take the body and braid it into a wheel on the gallows.

345
00:43:11.520 --> 00:43:17.120
The one who becomes counseled and intimidated in the Stegling Wheel -

346
00:43:17.280 --> 00:43:21.920
- Can often survive for a few days with terrible pain.

347
00:43:22.080 --> 00:43:25.560
It is probably one of the worst punishments.

348
00:43:28.000 --> 00:43:31.000
The punishment can be very cruel.

349
00:43:31.160 --> 00:43:35.680
But the medieval judicial order has gained unnecessarily bad reputation.

350
00:43:35.840 --> 00:43:39.680
Most crimes were punished with fines.

351
00:43:39.840 --> 00:43:45.440
The most severe penalties were mainly deterrent and were rarely used.

352
00:43:45.600 --> 00:43:50.480
You were pretty pragmatic.
 It was about resolving conflicts -

353
00:43:50.640 --> 00:43:53.520
- And to make society work.

354
00:43:55.880 --> 00:44:01.600
Birger Jarl's Peace Laws are liked by the people.
 They create order in the country.

355
00:44:02.800 --> 00:44:07.120
Birger Jarl's influence and power are growing in line with his success.

356
00:44:07.280 --> 00:44:11.720
When the old king dies, he places his son on the Swedish throne.

357
00:44:11.880 --> 00:44:16.520
But it is still Birger who governs, without being king.

358
00:44:16.680 --> 00:44:21.200
In this way he gets stability in the state and royal power.

359
00:44:21.360 --> 00:44:26.640
It is during Birger Jarl's time that Sweden becomes a national power with a king -

360
00:44:26.800 --> 00:44:32.320
- rich and powerful enough to control the entire kingdom through laws and bailiffs.

361
00:44:39.320 --> 00:44:43.320
The only thing missing is an organized military defense.

362
00:44:43.480 --> 00:44:49.960
Birger Jarl's son, Magnus LadulÃ¥s, will realize that.

363
00:44:50.120 --> 00:44:54.520
King Magnus LadulÃ¥s makes a deal with Swedish great men and big farmers.

364
00:44:54.680 --> 00:44:59.400
He gives them tax exemption, against the fact that they put up with men and weapons at war.

365
00:44:59.560 --> 00:45:06.760
In this way, the royal power gets weapons and knights to defend the kingdom.

366
00:45:06.920 --> 00:45:13.640
The agreement is called AlsnÃ¶ Stat.
 With that, the foundation is laid for the Swedish nobility.

367
00:45:23.520 --> 00:45:27.520
Darkness and cold pull over the country.

368
00:45:27.680 --> 00:45:32.960
It is the beginning of the 1300s, and the good times end.

369
00:45:34.080 --> 00:45:40.520
The climate is getting colder.
 The period called the Little Ice Age begins.

370
00:45:40.680 --> 00:45:45.600
The domestic animals are lacking in bait, and the harvests become bad.

371
00:45:47.960 --> 00:45:54.840
People starve and have a hard time - and it is believed that God is dissatisfied.

372
00:45:59.600 --> 00:46:05.720
Someone who claims to know the cause of the bad times is Holy Birgitta.

373
00:46:08.160 --> 00:46:13.680
She will be one of the Catholic Church's most important saints.

374
00:46:13.840 --> 00:46:17.920
But so far she is just a mourning widow.

375
00:46:19.720 --> 00:46:25.240
Birgitta was the daughter of a rich man.
 Her mother was related to the king.

376
00:46:25.400 --> 00:46:30.000
As a kid, she was special.
 She saw things that others did not see.

377
00:46:30.160 --> 00:46:35.760
Some meant that she was crazy, others that she was in contact with God.

378
00:46:39.600 --> 00:46:44.120
When her husband dies, she begins to get revelations.

379
00:46:58.120 --> 00:47:02.840
She first thinks that it is the devil who haunts her.

380
00:47:14.040 --> 00:47:20.200
In the end, she understands that it is Jesus.
 He convinces her.

381
00:47:20.360 --> 00:47:25.440
They should work together, and she will be his bride.

382
00:47:25.600 --> 00:47:29.680
Then she has the task of saving humanity -

383
00:47:29.840 --> 00:47:34.000
- And work against pride and evil, throughout the world.

384
00:47:56.880 --> 00:48:02.880
Birgitta had direct contact with God, Christ and the Virgin Mary -

385
00:48:03.040 --> 00:48:09.280
- As their language tubes, to bring their words to humanity.

386
00:48:09.440 --> 00:48:14.280
And she would found a monastery in their name.

387
00:48:17.120 --> 00:48:22.600
Birgitta's revelations were taken very seriously.
 Guidance was needed.

388
00:48:22.760 --> 00:48:28.320
And she was consulting on leadership in these difficult times.

389
00:48:30.440 --> 00:48:33.640
Birgitta's revelations are convincing.

390
00:48:33.800 --> 00:48:38.440
They describe a reality that people recognize themselves in.

391
00:48:38.600 --> 00:48:44.320
In the revelations, God explains that the famine and the suffering of the people depend on -

392
00:48:44.480 --> 00:48:49.960
- That the powerful are boastful and just care about their wealth.

393
00:48:50.120 --> 00:48:56.360
If the suffering is to end, they must think more about God and less about themselves.

394
00:48:57.880 --> 00:49:04.600
In the revelations, it is often an aggressive and vulgar language.

395
00:49:04.760 --> 00:49:08.400
She criticizes both Pope, church and royalty.

396
00:49:08.560 --> 00:49:14.040
A bishop was like a snail bathing in poop.
 A pope is compared to Judas.

397
00:49:14.200 --> 00:49:21.040
Queen Johanna of Naples an Aphhona that smells on her stinking buttocks.

398
00:49:26.040 --> 00:49:32.280
Birgitta has a credibility that makes her get away with her criticism.

399
00:49:32.440 --> 00:49:36.440
Her background made her high reputation.

400
00:49:36.600 --> 00:49:41.080
This was true both in Sweden and internationally.

401
00:49:42.640 --> 00:49:47.640
During the 1340s, Birgitta is close to the royal power.

402
00:49:47.800 --> 00:49:52.320
She is related to the king, and moves freely in the corridors of power.

403
00:49:55.200 --> 00:49:59.680
The one now sits on the Swedish throne is Magnus Eriksson.

404
00:49:59.840 --> 00:50:05.400
A strong and powerful king of both Sweden and Norway.

405
00:50:05.560 --> 00:50:11.040
He reverses the greatest empire in Europe at this time.

406
00:50:11.200 --> 00:50:16.520
It extends from Finland in the east to Greenland in the west.

407
00:50:16.680 --> 00:50:20.720
But it is a great power that is based on a loose foundation.

408
00:50:20.880 --> 00:50:25.840
Magnus has borrowed a lot of money to buy SkÃ¥ne from the Danes.

409
00:50:26.000 --> 00:50:29.040
A deal he will regret.

410
00:50:29.200 --> 00:50:32.280
For now, King Magnus is starting to have problems.

411
00:50:32.440 --> 00:50:35.560
King Magnus has loaned considerably.

412
00:50:35.720 --> 00:50:41.600
Now he has trouble paying the debts to the church and the Pope.

413
00:50:41.760 --> 00:50:47.680
But there is someone who thinks they have the solution to the problems - Birgitta.

414
00:50:47.840 --> 00:50:50.000
She has a plan.

415
00:50:50.160 --> 00:50:56.720
Birgitta persuades the king to go out on a crusade east, towards Novgorod.

416
00:50:56.880 --> 00:51:01.160
As the crusades occur in the name of God, for the Catholic Church -

417
00:51:01.320 --> 00:51:05.280
- Can King Magnus wait to pay the debts to the Pope.

418
00:51:05.440 --> 00:51:11.480
If the crusades succeed, both Magnus and the Pope can benefit from it.

419
00:51:11.640 --> 00:51:14.440
The crusades are religious companies.

420
00:51:14.600 --> 00:51:19.000
Catholicism should be spread.
 It is important for the papacy.

421
00:51:19.160 --> 00:51:21.760
It is also a political company.

422
00:51:21.920 --> 00:51:26.160
Different kingdoms want to expand, and then the crusades are used for it.

423
00:51:26.320 --> 00:51:31.880
Magnus Eriksson is driven by the fact that he wants crusades against Novgorod -

424
00:51:32.040 --> 00:51:35.960
â€“And expand the Swedish national power in that direction.

425
00:51:38.880 --> 00:51:44.360
Initially, at least military, you are successful.

426
00:51:51.960 --> 00:51:55.000
But it will not end well.

427
00:52:00.400 --> 00:52:05.520
If times have already become bad, they will be even worse.

428
00:52:09.480 --> 00:52:15.960
No crusades or prayers can save Sweden from the darkness that is on their way.

429
00:52:25.800 --> 00:52:31.760
In 1349, a boat from England adds to the harbor of Berg.

430
00:52:33.440 --> 00:52:39.080
On board the crews are sick or already dead.

431
00:52:39.240 --> 00:52:42.000
The plague has come.

432
00:52:42.160 --> 00:52:45.600
One year later, it comes across the border to Sweden.

433
00:52:47.440 --> 00:52:52.680
It is the race bites that infect.
 The fleas are spread with the help of the rats.

434
00:52:56.640 --> 00:53:01.120
Often a plague epidemic began with flea bite -

435
00:53:01.280 --> 00:53:04.600
- As resulted in bulbs in armpits or groin.

436
00:53:04.760 --> 00:53:08.720
It leads to death in about half of the cases.

437
00:53:08.880 --> 00:53:13.920
But worse was whether the bloodstream brought the bacteria to the lungs.

438
00:53:14.080 --> 00:53:20.120
In pneumonia, the bacteria were coughed to all around -

439
00:53:20.280 --> 00:53:23.560
- So that it became the spread of infection through the air.

440
00:53:23.720 --> 00:53:29.440
Then there is a hundred percent mortality, and many more who fall ill.

441
00:53:33.440 --> 00:53:40.040
The plague, the deaths, spreads across Europe during the mid-1300s.

442
00:53:44.920 --> 00:53:48.120
The people were, of course, completely terrified.

443
00:53:48.280 --> 00:53:52.520
For them, it must have been God's punishment and the downfall of the world.

444
00:53:59.840 --> 00:54:07.040
One third of all in Sweden die when the plague epidemics pull over the country.

445
00:54:09.640 --> 00:54:16.760
In 1350, the death of death emerges like a Lieman and harvests victims in Sweden.

446
00:54:19.760 --> 00:54:23.800
Thus, the Swedish tax base becomes more than halved -

447
00:54:23.960 --> 00:54:29.800
- And Magnus Eriksson has no opportunity to continue war.

448
00:54:29.960 --> 00:54:34.320
This will be the beginning of Magnus Eriksson's many accidents.

449
00:54:34.480 --> 00:54:39.360
The crusade against Novgorod and NÃ¶teborg becomes a failure.

450
00:54:39.520 --> 00:54:42.280
He has lost NÃ¶teborg.

451
00:54:42.440 --> 00:54:48.240
He owes the Pope and the Church so much money that he is banned.

452
00:54:48.400 --> 00:54:53.800
While it is bad for King Magnus, Birgitta is far away.

453
00:54:53.960 --> 00:54:58.280
She is in Rome to seek the Pope's support for her monastery.

454
00:55:06.280 --> 00:55:12.160
The rumor of Birgitta and her revelations is spread in Europe.

455
00:55:12.320 --> 00:55:18.000
It is difficult today to understand what influence her revelations had -

456
00:55:18.160 --> 00:55:21.960
- In the Christian world during this time.

457
00:55:26.600 --> 00:55:30.920
Birgitta never revisites Sweden.
 She dies in Rome 1373.

458
00:55:34.920 --> 00:55:41.320
But her revelations are spread, they are gathered and published in book form.

459
00:55:41.480 --> 00:55:47.240
Birgitta's ideas about reforming the relaxed Christianity -

460
00:55:47.400 --> 00:55:52.520
- And giving women influence, affects the entire Christian world.

461
00:55:56.960 --> 00:56:01.000
Birgitta Klosterorden opens in Vadstena 1384.

462
00:56:01.160 --> 00:56:07.000
Birgitta herself is declared saint in 1391, just 18 years after his death.

463
00:56:15.000 --> 00:56:18.040
I don't think any Swedish -

464
00:56:18.200 --> 00:56:22.640
- Have had the same meaning in the world as Birgitta.

465
00:56:36.760 --> 00:56:42.800
But how is it for Sweden and King Magnus Eriksson?
 Not so good.

466
00:56:42.960 --> 00:56:46.800
Magnus has a hard time repaying his huge debts.

467
00:56:46.960 --> 00:56:52.360
He tries to solve it in other ways - by making new money.

468
00:56:54.240 --> 00:56:59.800
The new coins are cheaper and are faster to manufacture.

469
00:56:59.960 --> 00:57:05.520
But at the same time they contain less silver than the previous coins.

470
00:57:05.680 --> 00:57:12.800
Then King Magnus forces people to switch old valuable to the new ones.

471
00:57:12.960 --> 00:57:20.720
But the new coins have such low quality that the church refuses to receive them.

472
00:57:20.880 --> 00:57:24.560
King Magnus money is useless.

473
00:57:31.160 --> 00:57:35.160
The kingdom is now in deep economic and political crisis.

474
00:57:35.320 --> 00:57:40.000
In addition, the plague continues to ravage in the country.

475
00:57:40.160 --> 00:57:47.080
The stability they managed to create in Sweden is now far away.

476
00:57:51.160 --> 00:57:56.320
It will take several hundred years before that change will be changed.

477
00:57:57.920 --> 00:58:02.480
Many will try to take control of the country.

478
00:58:02.640 --> 00:58:05.400
But only one will succeed.

479
00:58:18.000 --> 00:58:21.000
