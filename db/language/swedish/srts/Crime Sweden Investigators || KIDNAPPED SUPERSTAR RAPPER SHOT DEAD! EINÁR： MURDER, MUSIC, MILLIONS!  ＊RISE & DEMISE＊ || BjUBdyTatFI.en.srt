12
00:00:58,947 --> 00:01:03,251
And he was early recognized as a talented rapper in this area.

13
00:01:10,223 --> 00:01:15,127
Einar had problems in school and started acting and ended up in trouble.
 He was taken from

00:01:15,127 --> 00:01:19,363
her mother and was placed in state premises for troubled children on several occasions.

15
00:01:20,664 --> 00:01:28,304
February 18, 2018 When Einar was only 15 years old he and a friend divorced a teenager

16
00:01:28,304 --> 00:01:33,174
from his other friends, he beat the other boy and then tried to take him down to the ground

17
00:01:33,174 --> 00:01:38,545
.
 The stomach then continued

18
00:01:38,545 --> 00:01:47,185
to steal his jacket.
 Einar releases "Ducks Popo" with a music video on May 24, 2018.

19
00:01:48,787 --> 00:01:54,058
It gets a lot of attention but also a lot of counter -reactions with people who are wondering the quote "why

20
00:01:54,058 --> 00:01:59,929
pretend this little white boy be gangster. "Later that year, just three days after Einars

21
00:01:59,929 --> 00:02:06,501
16th birthday, September 8, 2018, he cut and cut another teenager in his arm with a knife, he

22
00:02:06,501 --> 00:02:13,239
was charged as a minor for abuse with a deadly weapon.
 At the beginning of his career

23
00:02:13,239 --> 00:02:19,911
got Einar support from SSTV (Southside TV) who supported him with money to make songs and music videos that also gave him

24
00:02:19,911 --> 00:02:26,550
much needed backup and "street cred" in the gangstarap genre Einar made music in. He had a hood

25
00:02:26,550 --> 00:02:33,088
to claim and the "valley" network as his muscle he was managed at that time by "Paki" and "Chapo"

26
00:02:49,268 --> 00:02:57,341
December 16, 2018 Einar close friend and manager "Paki" is shot to death inside an apartment in

27
00:02:57,341 --> 00:03:07,816
"Dalen" at least seven shots were fired and "Paki" was shot in the head and chest several times

28
00:03:23,995 --> 00:03:29,700
Chapo is brought to trial for the murder of "Paki" but the charges are not stuck and he is found innocent

29
00:03:29,700 --> 00:03:36,772
First in the "District Court" and then in the "High Court".
 Einar continues to release several songs and

30
00:03:36,772 --> 00:03:42,610
Videos on Youtube But it was in January 2019 that the rapper was blown up overnight

31
00:03:42,610 --> 00:03:47,981
When he released the song "The Cat in the area" that solved can be translated to

32
00:03:47,981 --> 00:03:53,185
The neighboring villain.
 At that time, Einar got into a rap beef when he and another rapper named

33
00:03:53,185 --> 00:03:59,257
"MPL" went back and forth online on social media with DISS song stands that acted insults and threats

34
00:04:24,810 --> 00:04:34,051
Einar and MPL had collaborated on a song with Dilly D released in early 2018 but the two rappers had problems

35
00:04:34,051 --> 00:04:36,186
with each other after that for unknown reason, at one

36
00:04:39,188 --> 00:04:44,860
Opportunity Einar uploads a story on Instagram where his armed with a gun says he is looking for "MPL"

37
00:04:49,864 --> 00:04:54,534
on his overnight star with the "cat in the neighborhood" Einar had this to say "I first released it on

38
00:04:55,501 --> 00:05:00,605
Youtube and there the trend as number one started and it received 400,000 views in five days

39
00:05:01,239 --> 00:05:07,911
Then I dropped it on Spotify and the next day it had 250,000 streams it was blown up

40
00:05:07,911 --> 00:05:12,548
things got completely crazy I couldn't understand it and it was number one

41
00:05:12,548 --> 00:05:18,053
In Sweden, the most played song in the whole country, the numbers just grew and grew "

42
00:05:19,821 --> 00:05:24,057
After his first banger became all that the gold child touched gold

43
00:05:24,057 --> 00:05:28,728
and took first place on the lists.
 d his song with over one hundred million streams

44
00:05:29,295 --> 00:05:36,000
was the common theme in Einar's music violence and gang crime.
 Einar's texts often referred to

45
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:42,472
Arms violence and drugs and his music videos also show both weapons and well -known criminals.

46
00:05:42,472 --> 00:05:47,643
Most of these music videos are recorded and took place in the "Enskededalen" which is an area of

47
00:05:47,643 --> 00:05:53,180
the south side of Stockholm and in this neighborhood there is a group of active that the police have

48
00:05:53,180 --> 00:05:59,485
Identified as a criminal network after the success of success with the success.
 “The cat in the area”

49
00:05:59,485 --> 00:06:06,624
Then it was time for Einar to introduce himself to real he then delivered his debut album

50
00:06:06,624 --> 00:06:13,530
"First class (first class)" The record had elements from the rappers "K27" and "Adaam".
 on the record were found, among other things

51
00:06:13,530 --> 00:06:19,401
The acclaimed title track "First Class (First Class)" which today has over 40 million streams

52
00:06:19,968 --> 00:06:27,408
the magazine "Expressen" and reported that Einar in just 10 weeks in the fall of 2019 had one

53
00:06:27,408 --> 00:06:34,547
60's list placements that completely crushed all competition after the extremely successful year

54
00:06:34,547 --> 00:06:41,352
2019 when Einar the light -skinned gangster rapper basically became Sweden's gold boy he

55
00:06:41,352 --> 00:06:48,624
Praised in media on television and in interviews he becomes Sweden's most played artist extremely fast

56
00:06:48,624 --> 00:06:55,697
at his rapid rise to fame in retrospect might be too fast for a 16-year-old boy at the end of

57
00:06:55,697 --> 00:07:03,403
In 2019, Einar had released both his debut album "First Class (First Class)" and his second album called "Number 1 (number one)" which was released

58
00:07:03,403 --> 00:07:09,975
on the rapper's birthday.
 At the beginning of 2020, the rapper ends with winning the prize for this year's newcomer

59
00:07:09,975 --> 00:07:16,246
At the Grammy Awards, he also won this year's hip hop.
 on another

60
00:07:16,280 --> 00:07:23,852
Price exhibition "P3 Gold Gala" he took home the category of this year's song for the super hit "The cat in the area"

61
00:07:42,167 --> 00:07:48,372
But at the same time, Einar has huge and unseen commercial successes as rappers and artist, his

62
00:07:48,405 --> 00:07:54,710
Personal relationships deteriorate and there is a dispute about money where the record companies'

63
00:07:54,710 --> 00:07:59,814
Production companies and criminal elements that support Einar early in career

64
00:07:59,814 --> 00:08:06,386
Feeling stiff on profits when Einar begins to generate million income.
 The details

65
00:08:06,386 --> 00:08:12,291
differs, but Einar's mother is said to have started another company "NS Production Scandinavia"

66
00:08:12,291 --> 00:08:17,295
In order for Einar to release music that would legally allow him to break his contract

67
00:08:17,295 --> 00:08:21,765
and keep all the money he comes in for himself, this did not fit well with

68
00:08:21,765 --> 00:08:26,602
People on the street.
 Einar lost his backup and was vulnerable to being attacked.

69
00:08:28,704 --> 00:08:34,775
In April 2020, Einar believes that he is going to a studio session with rapper "Haval" but

70
00:08:34,775 --> 00:08:41,881
Instead, kidnapped by a criminal organization called "Vårbynätverket (Vårby network / gang)".
 he gets beaten degraded

71
00:08:41,881 --> 00:08:48,286
and stolen by its prisoners on a Rolex watch worth more than SEK 300,000, two gold chains

72
00:08:48,286 --> 00:08:55,892
worth over SEK 160,000 and a gun.
 not just that his kidnapper also tries to push him after they

73
00:08:55,892 --> 00:09:01,930
released him and said they want 3 million or they will release humiliating pictures they took on him during

74
00:09:01,930 --> 00:09:08,302
the kidnapping itself.
 When the blackmail does not seem to work, the gang contact another gang

75
00:09:08,302 --> 00:09:14,707
and pays them for a bomb to be built.
 they want them to take the bomb and blast it outside einars or

76
00:09:14,707 --> 00:09:20,545
His parents' home, members of the gang are on the way with an explosive charge in a car to Einars

77
00:09:20,545 --> 00:09:27,750
Home but they turn when they are met by the police on the spot.
 So the kidnappers released

78
00:09:27,750 --> 00:09:33,655
The pictures on the net but it did not have the effect they were looking for.
 Einar's career was not destroyed and

79
00:09:33,655 --> 00:09:39,860
He briefly commented on this on social media and basically said that "anyone can be kidnapped"

80
00:10:04,446 --> 00:10:11,018
Instead of paying, Einar sought protection for "May network (May Network / Gang)" and "Västerås Network (Västerås Network / Gang)"

81
00:10:11,018 --> 00:10:16,689
which are the arch rivals and number one for the "spring village network (Vårby Network / gang as kidnapped Einar)" allegedly pay them one

82
00:10:16,689 --> 00:10:24,162
Cash sum and percentages on their music career.
 "Free Mayk (Mike) Makyil Yokhanna" "Free Namo (" Namo Stress "Boss of Västerås Gang)" Free Ali "" Free Alan "Shoutout" Kardå (Namo Stress Little Brother).

83
00:10:25,063 --> 00:10:30,500
With the Encrochat network cracked, Encrochat was a European-based communication network and

84
00:10:30,500 --> 00:10:35,971
service provider used primarily by organized crime to plan criminal activities,

85
00:10:35,971 --> 00:10:40,775
The gang's kidnapping of Einar was revealed and good evidence of the crime was given

86
00:10:40,775 --> 00:10:45,245
Because Einar never reported this event to the authorities and never cooperated with

87
00:10:45,245 --> 00:10:50,449
law enforcement agencies.
 During the police's work on the case, it was revealed that another famous rapper

88
00:10:50,449 --> 00:10:56,621
"Yasin" was involved in a previously failed kidnapping attempt by Einar, where Yasin's role

89
00:10:56,621 --> 00:11:02,792
was to attract Einar to a specific place so that the kidnappers could take him.
 “Yasin” was found

90
00:11:02,792 --> 00:11:07,863
guilty and imprisoned for his involvement in the preparations for the kidnapping he has

91
00:11:07,863 --> 00:11:13,267
already served their time and "yasin" is a free man "yasin" is coupled and considered to be a member

92
00:11:13,267 --> 00:11:20,373
In the infamous Stockholm gang "Shottaz" which has close ties to the gang "Filterless guys" or "flg"

93
00:11:22,942 --> 00:11:28,213
Another famous rapper and "friend" to Einar "Haval" later took over Yasin's role in it

94
00:11:28,213 --> 00:11:34,217
Successful kidnapping and attracted Einar in the kidnapper's hands.
 Haval could be seen on pictures

95
00:11:34,217 --> 00:11:39,188
When he and Einar arrived at the kidnapper's apartment and later dressed in Einar's gold chains

96
00:11:39,188 --> 00:11:44,058
received "Haval" a penalty of two and a half years in prison for his role in the kidnapping

97
00:11:44,058 --> 00:11:50,263
he will probably be released in the summer of 2022. "Haval" is considered close to one of

98
00:11:50,263 --> 00:11:56,702
the leaders of one side of the "valley network (valley network/gang)" with the nickname * Super Mario * He is also considered mostly having

99
00:11:56,702 --> 00:12:02,606
Control of nearby neighborhoods "Bagarmossen" and "Skarpnäck" where "Haval" comes from at that time.

100
00:12:02,606 --> 00:12:07,977
several other people involved in the kidnapping had previously been seen standing side by side with

101
00:12:07,977 --> 00:12:14,216
Einar's music videos and pictures not long before this event Einar was at least robbed

102
00:12:14,216 --> 00:12:21,321
once with gun threats in the fall of 2020. At the end of 2020 and early 2021, Einar will start to dismay

103
00:12:21,321 --> 00:12:27,726
Yasin but most rapper Haval and other people who "lit on" him both on social media and with

104
00:12:27,726 --> 00:12:34,332
Subliminal diss and on a live on Instagram he calls "Haval" a snake and a son to AB! TCH.

105
00:12:48,309 --> 00:12:52,613
At the beginning of 2021, Einar goes through Haval's district "Skarpnäck"

106
00:12:52,613 --> 00:12:56,683
in a car and plays Haval's verse of their collaboration track before the beef called

107
00:12:56,683 --> 00:12:59,485
"Hell Ye" is sent a clear message to Haval

108
00:13:05,490 --> 00:13:10,794
Which is reportedly responsible for Haval's Instagram account since Haval was locked then for Einar's kidnapping.

109
00:13:10,794 --> 00:13:14,730
answered Einár with an Instagram story where they stand on exactly

110
00:13:14,730 --> 00:13:21,736
The same place as Einar was hours before he posed with weapons.
 Einar posts more stories

111
00:13:21,736 --> 00:13:24,371
With automatic weapons in response ...

112
00:13:34,446 --> 00:13:39,483
On February 18, 2021, Einar was arrested for a serious weapons offense when two guns

113
00:13:39,483 --> 00:13:45,655
found by police in his home.
 Einar releases a song along with rapper “23” in

114
00:13:45,655 --> 00:13:53,528
early April 2021. "23" is backed up and supported by "May network (May network/gang, leader is Mayk)" and that gang is led by Mayk (Mike)) *Real name Maykil Yokhanna *

115
00:13:53,528 --> 00:13:58,799
And they are at war with the spring village network (the gang that kidnapped Einar) that Einar hate for obvious reasons.

116
00:14:04,069 --> 00:14:09,807
In the song "Trendsetter", both rappers take shot at the spring village network.

117
00:14:50,373 --> 00:14:56,845
On April 18, Haval's little brother "Dara" is shot dead in Kista, Stockholm.
 stands

118
00:14:56,845 --> 00:15:02,149
Outside his apartment building and smokes with his girlfriend at night.
 he has been shot several

119
00:15:02,149 --> 00:15:07,987
times and two masked men leave the crime scene on electric scooters, allegedly killed "Dara"

120
00:15:07,987 --> 00:15:13,591
Because Haval was imprisoned at that time for the kidnapping of Einar.
 Einar laid according to the police

121
00:15:13,591 --> 00:15:20,163
Theories money on "Darras" head as revenge.
 After this, Einar spent most of his time 2021

122
00:15:20,163 --> 00:15:26,134
Abroad in Dubai, Amsterdam and Spain to record their fifth album.
 it has been said to

123
00:15:26,134 --> 00:15:31,505
There was a great reward on "Einár", a large sum of money to be paid to the one who killed him.

124
00:15:38,044 --> 00:15:45,183
In September 2021, Einar releases a song with rapper "Adaam" from Märsta, Stockholm called "Dance".

125
00:15:46,684 --> 00:15:48,052
After the release of this song it was strongly speculated that

126
00:15:48,052 --> 00:15:55,091
Einar in his verse takes on the honor of having killed Haval's little brother "Dara"

127
00:15:55,091 --> 00:16:03,130
"Brother I'm going to pull up on your block and spill blood tonight after you are away imma make your brother ..."

128
00:16:03,130 --> 00:16:07,834
When he returns to Sweden after the summer he is often seen with the older rapper

129
00:16:07,834 --> 00:16:13,806
"Nobility".
 With Einar's own words, "Adel" had served as a mentor and big brother for him in

130
00:16:13,806 --> 00:16:19,977
The music industry.
 "Adel" has a long criminal record and thread bands.
 Near “Husby Hyenor”

131
00:16:19,977 --> 00:16:23,747
and other criminal organizations in the area "Husby" and "Järva" (Rinkeby, Tensta, Akalla)

132
00:16:24,281 --> 00:16:29,585
Until the autumn of 2021, there had been much gang violence in Stockholm with abuse, gunfire and

133
00:16:29,585 --> 00:16:39,826
Murder is at a record level and former friends turn to each other at a rapid pace.

134
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:54,871
newly released from prison and now the prospective rapper "Dumlee"

135
00:16:54,871 --> 00:17:00,443
He is the old friend of "Adel" and "Dumlee" is a member of the "Death Patrol" who is in a

136
00:17:00,443 --> 00:17:08,816
brutally and deadly gang war often called "Shottaz vs. Death Patrol" dating back to 2015 as we

137
00:17:15,988 --> 00:17:19,257
mentioned earlier is rapper Yasin who was convicted of involvement in the kidnapping of

138
00:17:19,257 --> 00:17:27,064
Einar a member of the gang "Shottaz. The rapper" Ze "is also seen hanging out with Einar, Adel and

139
00:17:27,064 --> 00:17:33,569
