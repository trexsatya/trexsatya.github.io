00:00:04,160 --> 00:00:09,120
If you want to share an opinion, you can write a submitter.

2
00:00:09,280 --> 00:00:14,360
It should have a clear thesis and be subjective.
 That's your opinion.

3
00:00:14,520 --> 00:00:20,680
Catch readers' interest.
 Persuade them with your reasoning and argue.

4
00:00:20,840 --> 00:00:23,960
All can send a submitter-

5
00:00:24,120 --> 00:00:28,040
-But the newspaper decides if it is taken in.

6
00:00:28,200 --> 00:00:31,320
To think about when writing:

7
00:00:31,480 --> 00:00:37,120
Have a red thread throughout the submitter.
 Then it is easier to keep up.

8
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:42,440
Road arguments against each other.
 If you think someone doesn't hold with-

9
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:46,040
-Then explain why your opinion is better.

10
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:50,200
Finish with a feedback to the introductory-

11
00:00:50,360 --> 00:00:53,400
-To encourage readers.

12
00:00:53,560 --> 00:00:59,760
Write the submitter with name.
 Then you put a personal touch on it.
