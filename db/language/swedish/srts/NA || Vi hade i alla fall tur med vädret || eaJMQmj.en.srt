1
00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:54.920
- Did you have to wear that?
 - I want to swim now!

2
00:00:56.680 --> 00:01:02.440
- I don't want to go.
 - It is final discussed.
 Lend a hand!

3
00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:09.680
You can't be home alone for several weeks, you have to understand that.

4
00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:16.720
- Dad, where will this be?
 - No, release the air first!

5
00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:31.320
-What are you doing?
 - You see that well.

6
00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:39.880
- Here are the oars.
 - In in the caravan!

7
00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:43.400
- Are you taking the pump?
 –Wa?

8
00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:48.600
- Are you taking the pump?
 -Yes.

9
00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:58.880
You can take this in the carriage?

10
00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:19.600
- We are a little late.
 -I know.
 Is it my fault?

11
00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:23.720
I want to swim, dad!

12
00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:38.600
Gun, are you kind and check the air in the rings?

13
00:03:57.040 --> 00:04:02.200
It looks nice.
 Can you take the other side?

14
00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:16.680
Excuse me, can you drive a little, so I reach to refuel my car?

15
00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:22.120
- If you calm down for a while.
 Okay?
 -Okay.

16
00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:35.400
Gun!
 It is only needed a little bit to refuel.
 Do you drive forward?

17
00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:39.480
Just a little bit ...

18
00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:47.040
Forward!
 A little more...

19
00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:52.120
Good!
 So yes.

20
00:04:54.040 --> 00:04:57.000
What the hell!

21
00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:07.560
What the hell is that question about?

22
00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:15.200
What are you doing ... huh?

23
00:05:17.280 --> 00:05:22.680
Hey you!
 This is my pump - take this one!

24
00:05:23.200 --> 00:05:28.560
Forgive me.
 But that Ragggarävel drove straight in ...

25
00:05:28.720 --> 00:05:32.840
What did you say, the guy?
 Fucking road snail!

26
00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:36.000
- Bon Dragare!
 - Now damn!

27
00:05:41.200 --> 00:05:46.320
What the hell are you doing, your fucking tatter?

28
00:05:47.360 --> 00:05:53.000
- Damn Raggar forms!
 - Don't talk ... with those trolleys!

29
00:06:09.080 --> 00:06:14.160
Look at Grandpa!
 Here he lies and sleeps.

30
00:06:14.320 --> 00:06:17.480
Hi dad.
 How are you?
 Are you ready?

31
00:06:17.640 --> 00:06:21.440
Oh oh oh...

32
00:06:21.600 --> 00:06:25.600
- I thought it had happened.
 - It took some time, dad.

33
00:06:25.760 --> 00:06:30.240
Well ... - aren't you done now?

34
00:06:30.400 --> 00:06:34.800
Will you have that on you?
 We are going on vacation.

35
00:06:34.960 --> 00:06:38.080
Yes.

36
00:06:38.240 --> 00:06:42.280
Should we try to get away, then?

37
00:06:42.440 --> 00:06:45.760
- Can we not stay here?
 -Do you want that?

38
00:06:45.920 --> 00:06:50.960
Yes.
 Rather than the disgusting caravan.

39
00:06:52.040 --> 00:06:56.640
-Quiet now.
 - If we would try to get away.

40
00:06:56.800 --> 00:07:02.200
Rudolf, the fishermen are waiting ... it was this one, huh?

41
00:07:02.720 --> 00:07:06.120
Yes.
 And...

42
00:07:06.280 --> 00:07:11.040
- Should you bring that one?
 - How does it manage otherwise?

43
00:07:15.960 --> 00:07:23.320
- Certainly on the way.
 Nice, huh ... rudolf?
 - Yes, it's beautiful weather.

44
00:07:25.520 --> 00:07:28.440
So we should have it all the time.

45
00:07:28.600 --> 00:07:35.240
With the caravan we can go wherever we want.
 I call it vacation!

46
00:07:36.400 --> 00:07:39.320
Freedom!

47
00:07:41.200 --> 00:07:46.160
Or how, little stump?
 Up with your chin now.

48
00:07:46.320 --> 00:07:51.560
Finally, get together together - the whole family ...

49
00:07:51.720 --> 00:07:55.440
It will be really nice.

50
00:08:07.960 --> 00:08:13.680
No.
 It's not possible.
 We'll be too late here.

51
00:08:13.840 --> 00:08:16.720
You run there.
 But do it, then!

52
00:08:16.880 --> 00:08:22.080
I go here and then you shout if you find it.

53
00:08:37.760 --> 00:08:41.680
Wolfgang!

54
00:08:41.840 --> 00:08:46.040
–Wolfgang ... —Tyst!

55
00:08:47.040 --> 00:08:49.040
Shut up!

56
00:08:49.200 --> 00:08:54.720
Gösta!
 Here it is - I've found it!

57
00:08:57.360 --> 00:09:00.480
Is it 141?

58
00:09:08.680 --> 00:09:12.840
Rudolf, don't scream at the campsite.

59
00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:18.800
Many people sleep at this time and they can wake up.

60
00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:29.440
Can you sit there.
 I'll bed.

61
00:09:31.400 --> 00:09:34.440
The flower!
 Can you take it?

62
00:09:38.480 --> 00:09:41.440
Why do I have to sleep on the floor?

63
00:09:41.600 --> 00:09:48.480
Dad, me and Johan sleep here and Grandpa sleeps over there.

64
00:09:48.640 --> 00:09:53.840
Dad's little girl can sleep on a rubber mattress?

65
00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:58.760
- Can I sleep in the tent?
 - It's too cold outside.

66
00:09:58.920 --> 00:10:04.480
- Indians don't sleep in a caravan.
 - No, but you're not a Indian.

67
00:10:04.640 --> 00:10:08.480
You are cowboy, as a father.

68
00:10:11.720 --> 00:10:17.080
Rudolf, Sit there for a while.
 I'll take a quilt here.

69
00:10:17.240 --> 00:10:23.440
- The flower you can put there.
 - I start to get dizzy from blowing.

70
00:10:23.600 --> 00:10:29.880
Rudolf, give her the pump!
 It is in the cabinet under the flower.

71
00:10:30.040 --> 00:10:36.680
- But the cabinet is locked.
 - Located?
 Wait, you should see.

72
00:10:36.840 --> 00:10:42.360
- Can the flower remain?
 -Yes.
 Sit, so I'll arrange this.

73
00:10:42.520 --> 00:10:46.480
Look!
 It's a security barrier here.

74
00:10:46.640 --> 00:10:52.160
It's because it doesn't ... get up here ... when you go.

75
00:10:52.320 --> 00:10:57.840
Where is the fucking pump?
 It's not here anyway.

76
00:11:02.120 --> 00:11:05.720
It's a barrier here too ...

77
00:11:05.880 --> 00:11:11.040
- Not here!
 Where can it be?
 - Maybe in the cabinet there.

78
00:11:11.200 --> 00:11:16.640
Here it is not.
 Don't say we forgot it!

79
00:11:16.800 --> 00:11:21.960
- Now I shit in this!
 - Help for here.

80
00:11:32.880 --> 00:11:38.800
No, Rudolf!
 You shouldn't do this - think about the "pump".

81
00:11:47.320 --> 00:11:51.440
Don't go on it when I blow!

82
00:11:52.520 --> 00:11:54.920
Dad, I'm tired.

83
00:11:55.080 --> 00:12:00.360
No, this is not possible.
 We do this systematically.

84
00:12:08.080 --> 00:12:13.080
Damn box!
 Cursed pump!

85
00:12:23.080 --> 00:12:27.760
So nice that we are finally on our way ...

86
00:12:29.960 --> 00:12:35.320
... and that you take care of dad ... so nice ...

87
00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:41.400
He is so alone.

88
00:12:45.360 --> 00:12:53.080
It means a lot to him to accompany us ... to meet the kids ...

89
00:13:31.240 --> 00:13:35.080
No ... Gösta!

90
00:13:38.200 --> 00:13:41.480
They can wake up!

91
00:14:10.280 --> 00:14:14.800
Nice anyway ... Four week vacation!

92
00:14:18.600 --> 00:14:23.440
Four wonderful weeks.
 In the caravan.

93
00:14:29.640 --> 00:14:34.800
Snoring

94
00:14:52.360 --> 00:14:55.240
Take this one!

95
00:14:55.400 --> 00:14:58.400
- Where should this stand?
 - On the sink.

96
00:14:58.560 --> 00:15:01.880
Andiamo, é tardi!

97
00:15:02.040 --> 00:15:05.800
Mom, Vai Dentro!

98
00:15:23.560 --> 00:15:26.240
Jean!

99
00:15:26.400 --> 00:15:29.440
Jean !!

100
00:15:37.960 --> 00:15:43.600
--Je ne suis pas un artist.
 –Ce n'est pas la question.

101
00:15:48.880 --> 00:15:52.520
Thanks.
 - From Gutterne!

102
00:15:56.880 --> 00:16:02.480
I knew it!
 It was something we had forgotten.

103
00:16:03.080 --> 00:16:06.920
He can't be far away.

104
00:16:11.720 --> 00:16:18.000
Madame Peugot!
 Please, contact the reception.

105
00:16:21.280 --> 00:16:28.400
You!
 Fried perch, that's the best thing I know.

106
00:16:28.560 --> 00:16:34.480
Mr. Rudolf Johansson!
 Please contact the reception.

107
00:16:34.640 --> 00:16:39.000
- Don't you Rudolf Johansson?
 -Yes.

108
00:16:39.160 --> 00:16:44.000
- Then they call you in the speaker.
 -Oh really.

109
00:16:44.640 --> 00:16:48.320
Do you hear nothing?!

110
00:16:48.480 --> 00:16:55.280
Here we have been looking like madmen!
 Now you are moving on the pans, we are going.

111
00:16:57.520 --> 00:17:01.840
Bowl!
 And thank you.

112
00:17:07.760 --> 00:17:14.960
- Do you have to drive so damn fast?
 –70.
 It's a good march speed.

113
00:17:16.440 --> 00:17:21.720
Look at those two!
 Tandem cyclists ...

114
00:17:21.880 --> 00:17:27.720
It is also a way to vacation.
 You should not be in a hurry ...

115
00:17:27.880 --> 00:17:34.280
- But you get fitness.
 - Look, how they drive!

116
00:17:34.440 --> 00:17:41.520
No wonder there are many accidents happening.
 Why are they in such a hurry?

117
00:17:48.480 --> 00:17:51.600
Look here!

118
00:17:53.800 --> 00:17:58.960
I crawl in 30 ... Imagine preventing traffic like that!

119
00:18:02.600 --> 00:18:07.880
They should be banned in holiday traffic!

120
00:18:09.360 --> 00:18:12.880
But it's not a bad caravan.

121
00:18:13.920 --> 00:18:18.040
-Be careful!
 - Damn road -snail!

122
00:18:20.920 --> 00:18:28.240
Do you think we can do it?
 No.
 "We cooperate in traffic" ...

123
00:18:28.400 --> 00:18:34.680
If they could go aside a bit.
 Lie in the middle of the road like that!

124
00:18:37.440 --> 00:18:42.560
We have to drive again!
 It may carry or burst.

125
00:18:52.720 --> 00:18:56.240
Yes!

126
00:18:59.480 --> 00:19:03.520
Did you see?
 So they should be taken.

127
00:19:08.440 --> 00:19:12.120
-I have to pee.
 –Wa?

128
00:19:12.280 --> 00:19:18.160
-I have to pee.
 - But not now, Dad!

129
00:19:18.320 --> 00:19:23.040
-I must.
 -Okay.

130
00:19:36.560 --> 00:19:40.000
Damn!

131
00:19:40.160 --> 00:19:44.160
Do you see now, what he is doing?

132
00:19:52.800 --> 00:19:58.320
- Should we drink a cup of coffee?
 - Can we get coffee?

133
00:20:00.640 --> 00:20:05.000
-Never in my life!
 We do not have time.
 - I have to poop, dad.

134
00:20:05.160 --> 00:20:08.880
- But stay!
 -I can not.

135
00:20:17.960 --> 00:20:23.200
-Dad!
 There is frog fry here.
 -Yes Yes.

136
00:20:23.360 --> 00:20:29.200
- Don't go too close to the road!
 - It was good coffee, Gun.

137
00:20:30.920 --> 00:20:36.720
- What is this for a button?
 -What then?

138
00:20:36.880 --> 00:20:43.120
Well it?
 It is nothing.
 Have it on automatically, Little Stumpan.

139
00:20:44.600 --> 00:20:48.400
Jean!
 Jean!

140
00:20:52.920 --> 00:20:56.960
Now we don't have time to sit here.

141
00:20:57.120 --> 00:21:02.560
- rudolf, do you throw it in the trash can?
 -Yes.

142
00:21:06.480 --> 00:21:11.280
Lotta!
 You help with the chairs.

143
00:21:13.840 --> 00:21:19.960
Johan, now you come here!
 Now we are going to travel.

144
00:21:22.960 --> 00:21:26.160
Ouch!

145
00:21:28.440 --> 00:21:32.600
The garbage can is full.

146
00:22:06.920 --> 00:22:10.840
Now I get hold of you!

147
00:22:11.000 --> 00:22:16.280
Don't just get from the town on shit 'down!

148
00:22:16.440 --> 00:22:21.160
I shoot 'off both legs!

149
00:22:21.320 --> 00:22:26.880
How do you think the cows feel, when they get glass in the grove, huh?

150
00:22:27.040 --> 00:22:33.120
On the animals in small shades?
 Togs that you would really shoot 'the bowl!

151
00:22:33.280 --> 00:22:37.600
Do you think we could tolerate to this?

152
00:22:40.480 --> 00:22:44.520
Man sku 'slide' the bowl of you!

153
00:22:44.680 --> 00:22:49.760
They are too damn good.
 They are just starting to pick up now.

154
00:25:35.480 --> 00:25:39.680
Weave the box, Rudolf!

155
00:25:43.400 --> 00:25:48.800
- Cast!
 Can handle the rear view mirrors ... - fan!

156
00:26:11.840 --> 00:26:14.240
Ahh!

157
00:26:14.400 --> 00:26:18.160
- Gösta ... - Dad!

158
00:26:31.880 --> 00:26:35.400
Damn!

159
00:26:40.480 --> 00:26:44.520
It was good, Gun.

160
00:26:45.440 --> 00:26:48.440
-A little more?
 -Yes thank you.

161
00:26:51.000 --> 00:26:53.200
- Yes?
 -I am full.

162
00:26:53.360 --> 00:26:56.800
And so a little lingonberry.

163
00:27:16.720 --> 00:27:22.120
Shouldn't you have some food, honey?
 It is good.

164
00:27:26.800 --> 00:27:32.000
Don't you like cabbage dolls, Gösta?

165
00:27:32.160 --> 00:27:36.640
- Dad is so bad.
 - It's right for him.

166
00:27:39.160 --> 00:27:45.840
He has an unfortunate ability to complicate everything.

167
00:27:49.040 --> 00:27:52.600
And he is not particularly handy.

168
00:27:52.760 --> 00:27:58.040
Grandpa, do you remember when Dad was breaking your tractor?

169
00:28:05.080 --> 00:28:09.640
If I were to put on some coffee ...

170
00:28:16.920 --> 00:28:25.080
- I want to get stuck in the laundry.
 - He is your dad anyway.

171
00:28:25.240 --> 00:28:29.520
He thinks he knows best.

172
00:28:31.400 --> 00:28:35.360
He is not so easy.

173
00:28:35.520 --> 00:28:39.560
He wants us to have a nice holiday.

174
00:28:39.720 --> 00:28:45.680
- I would have had to stay home.
 -Yes Yes.

175
00:28:47.320 --> 00:28:51.160
You can try to be a little kind.

176
00:28:51.320 --> 00:28:54.520
Next summer you may not be.

177
00:28:54.680 --> 00:29:00.080
- You are soon big now.
 - But he doesn't notice.

178
00:29:05.080 --> 00:29:11.480
It's only a few weeks left now.
 We still have it pretty wonderful.

179
00:29:13.040 --> 00:29:16.480
Differently than at home.

180
00:29:24.760 --> 00:29:30.640
You're really good.
 - Gösta, join now!
 You can stand in the goal.

181
00:30:02.000 --> 00:30:06.600
High pop music

182
00:30:11.440 --> 00:30:19.320
Do you have to kick the ball here?
 People may want some calm on their vacation.

183
00:30:24.800 --> 00:30:31.520
- Are you with, Grandpa?
 -I can not take it.
 Grandpa is tired.

184
00:30:33.000 --> 00:30:39.000
- Dad, do you play football with me?
 -I do not feel good.

185
00:30:39.160 --> 00:30:44.840
- Let dad be at peace.
 - Can we not swim, then?

186
00:30:48.840 --> 00:30:54.280
-What are you doing?
 -!
 Pee and lie down ...

187
00:30:55.920 --> 00:31:01.960
Lotta has a hubby!
 Lotta has a hubby!
 - Look, Dad!

188
00:31:02.120 --> 00:31:09.880
- Lotta has a hubby.
 -Oh really?!
 You haven't said anything about that.

189
00:31:10.040 --> 00:31:14.560
- What is his name, then?
 -I know.
 His name is Lasse.

190
00:31:14.720 --> 00:31:18.600
-Lasse ... - now, Gösta!

191
00:31:18.760 --> 00:31:23.800
Don't you understand that the girl is getting sad?

192
00:31:33.200 --> 00:31:36.600
- Look, mom!
 - In the refrigerator.

193
00:31:36.760 --> 00:31:41.640
- Hurry now, Gun!
 - Where should you go?

194
00:31:41.800 --> 00:31:48.720
Into town and shop.
 Gösta wants something strong against the headaches.

195
00:31:48.880 --> 00:31:54.000
Well, should you buy out?
 - Gösta!

196
00:31:57.000 --> 00:32:02.080
Do you want to be kind and buy a half for me?

197
00:32:08.320 --> 00:32:13.320
Where is the Satan's system?
 We can not make it.

198
00:32:14.920 --> 00:32:17.760
Take it easy.

199
00:32:19.000 --> 00:32:21.760
Where!

200
00:32:23.840 --> 00:32:27.040
Beware the cyclist!
 But not here!

201
00:32:51.960 --> 00:32:54.760
Now I know!

202
00:32:54.920 --> 00:33:01.160
If you loosen the handbrake, we swing.

203
00:33:02.240 --> 00:33:08.920
We swing back and forth, then we come out.

204
00:33:09.080 --> 00:33:12.240
Oh!
 We're coming now...

205
00:33:15.120 --> 00:33:17.680
Gösta!

206
00:33:32.840 --> 00:33:35.960
Hello!
 You!

207
00:33:36.120 --> 00:33:41.200
Hello!
 Would you be able to come here a blow?

208
00:33:42.360 --> 00:33:45.560
Just a small blow.

209
00:33:45.880 --> 00:33:50.280
Here - take this one.
 We are stuck.

210
00:33:50.440 --> 00:33:56.040
Buy a whole explorer and keep the rest!
 We will not come out.

211
00:33:56.200 --> 00:34:00.200
- They will close soon.
 -Of course.

212
00:34:02.560 --> 00:34:05.360
You!
 That is where!

213
00:34:05.520 --> 00:34:10.720
What are you doing?
 Where are you going?
 Your cursed ...

214
00:34:36.280 --> 00:34:41.800
-Wait!
 I'm just going to go now.
 - You there.
 Hello!

215
00:34:47.040 --> 00:34:50.440
Finally someone!
 Can you help us?

216
00:34:52.200 --> 00:34:59.280
No no.
 We have not parked here - we are trapped!

217
00:34:59.440 --> 00:35:06.520
We cannot come out and therefore we have not been able to stop in anything!

218
00:35:09.080 --> 00:35:12.000
No...

219
00:35:24.800 --> 00:35:30.400
- Don't you have a splash, Gösta?
 -No.

220
00:36:46.160 --> 00:36:51.280
- It can be seen ... - no, then.
 Come now!

221
00:36:57.760 --> 00:37:03.760
- Now I can no longer cope.
 - Was a little calm, Gösta.

222
00:37:03.920 --> 00:37:10.840
- Why did he go?
 - We are struggling in it.
 Darling...

223
00:37:14.960 --> 00:37:19.240
No, Gösta.
 Gösta!

224
00:37:21.400 --> 00:37:25.600
Oh, what a holiday!
 Huh ...?

225
00:37:25.760 --> 00:37:32.280
We haven't been together you and I for fourteen days.

226
00:37:56.280 --> 00:37:59.440
No, Gun!
 Don't wake him up.

227
00:38:01.760 --> 00:38:07.560
- But here he can't sleep?
 -It does not matter.
 Come now.

228
00:38:08.800 --> 00:38:14.640
- Hi, kids!
 -Hi dad.
 Come and read the Phantom.

229
00:38:15.640 --> 00:38:19.400
Wait.
 I have a surprise.

230
00:38:21.680 --> 00:38:25.240
Look, that's the tent!

231
00:38:25.400 --> 00:38:28.960
I had thought that you would get to sleep in the tent tonight.

232
00:38:29.120 --> 00:38:34.800
- you?!
 -I want to sleep with you.

233
00:38:34.960 --> 00:38:43.200
- We brought the tent for your sake.
 - I want to sleep with you and mom.

234
00:38:43.360 --> 00:38:49.080
You have done that throughout the holiday.
 Don't Indians sleep in a caravan?

235
00:38:49.240 --> 00:38:53.000
I'm not a Indian.

236
00:39:01.880 --> 00:39:04.800
Good morning.

237
00:39:21.160 --> 00:39:27.600
-Dad!
 I want to bathe.
 - We can't do it now.

238
00:39:29.040 --> 00:39:32.280
-Why not?
 - But quiet now!

239
00:39:32.440 --> 00:39:39.480
There will be nothing bathing for you this summer - and no fishing either.

240
00:39:39.640 --> 00:39:45.200
Grandpa says we should never bathe.
 You are giant!

241
00:39:45.360 --> 00:39:49.960
-Stop now!
 - Dad, Lotta strikes me!

242
00:39:50.120 --> 00:39:53.720
Stop now, both!
 Dad drives.

243
00:40:14.600 --> 00:40:17.760
Mother!
 Mother...

244
00:40:25.680 --> 00:40:28.760
How is it?

245
00:40:28.920 --> 00:40:31.560
Ruotsi ... Sweden!

246
00:40:31.720 --> 00:40:34.920
Ruotsi!

247
00:40:35.080 --> 00:40:38.600
Hurray!
 HURRAY!

248
00:40:46.920 --> 00:40:51.560
- Dad, my ball!
 -What is it?

249
00:40:51.720 --> 00:40:59.920
- My ball!
 - My sandwich!
 It is ruined.

250
00:41:00.080 --> 00:41:05.560
-Here.
 - It can't be eaten.

251
00:41:08.880 --> 00:41:12.720
So!
 Go to mom now.
 - What was that?

252
00:41:12.880 --> 00:41:16.800
My ball is gone.
 Not there.
 Where!

253
00:41:43.080 --> 00:41:48.640
- It's the wrong ball.
 -It does not matter.
 This one is finer.

254
00:41:48.800 --> 00:41:53.360
- It's not mine.
 - Pleasure now!
 I blow up the mattress.

255
00:41:53.520 --> 00:42:00.800
-I want to bathe.
 - First of the rubber mattress, huh?

256
00:42:00.960 --> 00:42:07.000
- You can fish with me.
 - I don't want to fish, I want to swim.

257
00:42:10.040 --> 00:42:15.960
- Dad, Blow this up too.
 - Not two things at the same time!

258
00:43:07.520 --> 00:43:12.000
-I do not want to.
 - But bathe now.

259
00:43:12.160 --> 00:43:16.640
No one else bathes.
 I do not want to!

260
00:43:16.800 --> 00:43:23.800
I do not understand anything.
 For two weeks you have been talking about this.
 Bathe!

261
00:43:23.960 --> 00:43:26.960
It's cold.

262
00:43:42.640 --> 00:43:47.320
Please, Matilda.
 We're going home now.

263
00:43:48.160 --> 00:43:52.560
Grandfather freezes.
 Matilda, stop now!

264
00:44:09.160 --> 00:44:11.760
Now we have to go home.

265
00:44:19.480 --> 00:44:23.120
No, Matilda!
 Remove the bucket!

266
00:44:27.320 --> 00:44:29.160
Grandfather!

267
00:44:50.520 --> 00:44:53.240
Ouch!

268
00:45:20.200 --> 00:45:24.040
Ah!
 Fy thousand, so nice!

269
00:45:27.560 --> 00:45:32.800
Well, Rudolf ... Here you have a lot of nature, huh?

270
00:45:35.240 --> 00:45:41.040
- Yes, I go fishing.
 - Wait with it.
 First the TV antenna.

271
00:45:41.200 --> 00:45:46.600
-Yes!
 I want to watch TV.
 - The guy so much wants.

272
00:45:46.760 --> 00:45:49.600
Help, so it goes fast!

273
00:45:54.040 --> 00:45:57.920
-Now I am ready.
 -Hurry up!

274
00:45:58.080 --> 00:46:03.480
–O ... Oops.
 - Near good, dad.
 Hurry up!

275
00:46:05.120 --> 00:46:09.120
-Is it good?
 -No.
 Go back.
 So!

276
00:46:09.280 --> 00:46:12.960
- It jumps.
 - Now it rolls!

277
00:46:13.120 --> 00:46:17.920
- Release after ... - Now it jumps again.

278
00:46:19.920 --> 00:46:25.520
- It is still rolling!
 - It was better before.
 - Dad!

279
00:46:29.520 --> 00:46:31.800
Good!

280
00:46:31.960 --> 00:46:38.400
... folds the body together and gets a perfect stroke.
 What a hope!

281
00:46:38.560 --> 00:46:42.160
We probably get it in reprise.

282
00:46:42.320 --> 00:46:49.400
Here - see the perfect rise!
 The perfect ankle…

283
00:46:49.560 --> 00:46:52.360
... and then the stroke.

284
00:46:54.920 --> 00:46:57.920
32.80, please.

285
00:47:14.000 --> 00:47:17.000
Don't poke in the food!

286
00:47:24.120 --> 00:47:27.120
62.75!

287
00:47:38.800 --> 00:47:43.440
- I want barbecue sausage.
 - Now you eat.

288
00:47:43.600 --> 00:47:48.920
- Why does she get a barbecue sausage?
 - Now you eat, otherwise fucking!

289
00:47:49.080 --> 00:47:51.800
Gösta!

290
00:47:59.720 --> 00:48:03.760
- MMM ... —Hon tease, dad.

291
00:48:03.920 --> 00:48:09.600
- Don't get her.
 Eat!
 -I dont want.
 She is teased again.

292
00:48:09.760 --> 00:48:14.160
Lotta, stop teasing!

293
00:48:14.320 --> 00:48:18.400
- damn!
 - See hell!

294
00:48:18.560 --> 00:48:21.360
- Damn old man!
 - Hold mouth!

295
00:48:21.520 --> 00:48:24.760
It is not possible.

296
00:48:24.920 --> 00:48:28.640
You're not really wise, shit guy!

297
00:48:39.520 --> 00:48:45.320
- Not another sound!
 - Now I have had a headache.

298
00:48:55.960 --> 00:49:01.400
Why don't you eat?
 You have no food.

299
00:49:01.560 --> 00:49:07.240
- No urgency for me.
 - Why don't you take a "today's"?

300
00:49:07.400 --> 00:49:13.280
It's just to sabotage.
 This is the last time you are with!

301
00:49:13.440 --> 00:49:18.440
-Sabotage!
 - A cobbler box.

302
00:49:42.240 --> 00:49:44.640
This is not wise ...

303
00:49:44.800 --> 00:49:51.240
She is gone!
 - Get in the car!
 - I have to go to the police.

304
00:49:51.400 --> 00:49:54.560
-I can not take it.
 - Put yourself in the caravan.

305
00:49:54.720 --> 00:50:00.320
- It is prohibited.
 - I drive carefully, little old man.

306
00:50:02.080 --> 00:50:05.080
Now we are in a hurry.
 To the police!

307
00:50:06.840 --> 00:50:10.440
- Where can she be?
 -She is gone!

308
00:50:10.600 --> 00:50:17.560
- I have to lighten the bladder.
 -Not again!
 You don't do anything else.

309
00:50:17.720 --> 00:50:22.480
Gösta, I can't stay anymore.

310
00:50:48.200 --> 00:50:50.880
No!

311
00:50:54.560 --> 00:50:57.560
Stay!
 Gösta ...

312
00:50:59.680 --> 00:51:03.160
STAY!
 STOP!

313
00:51:22.000 --> 00:51:27.160
-My husband!
 The caravan - over there!
 -Jump up!

314
00:51:34.360 --> 00:51:38.360
- She never comes back.
 -Silent!

315
00:51:40.000 --> 00:51:45.080
- Look, it's mom!
 -What the hell?!

316
00:51:51.440 --> 00:51:54.320
The police ...

317
00:52:04.800 --> 00:52:08.480
- From the county traffic group.
 - So good that you came!

318
00:52:08.640 --> 00:52:12.960
My daughter has disappeared.
 We argued...

319
00:52:13.120 --> 00:52:21.360
Well.
 I have followed you.
 You go way too fast with the caravan.

320
00:52:21.520 --> 00:52:28.560
My wife is riding a motorcycle.
 It was after this with ... tavern and ...

321
00:52:28.720 --> 00:52:31.120
She lay back in ...

322
00:52:31.280 --> 00:52:36.880
We're talking about that later.
 I want to look at your driver's license first.

323
00:52:37.040 --> 00:52:40.560
I would drive so gently ...

324
00:52:40.720 --> 00:52:47.560
I probably have it back here, we changed pants before we went ...

325
00:52:51.000 --> 00:52:56.600
Where are you going, then?
 - Imagine she would disappear ...

326
00:52:57.240 --> 00:53:02.000
First the speeding, then we talk about your problems.

327
00:53:02.160 --> 00:53:07.160
Not fast enough ... the motorcycle ... 150 ...

328
00:53:07.320 --> 00:53:14.000
- Can I look at your driver's license?
 - She disappeared ... on the tavern ...

329
00:53:14.160 --> 00:53:18.160
Now I want to look at the driver's license!

330
00:53:21.120 --> 00:53:25.360
Thanks.
 I'll keep it for a while.

331
00:53:35.520 --> 00:53:41.360
- You haven't been drinking alcohol?
 - Not a drop!

332
00:53:41.520 --> 00:53:45.200
I don't drive ... didn't drink.

333
00:53:46.920 --> 00:53:52.320
- I will let you do an alcohol test.
 -I thank.

334
00:53:54.600 --> 00:54:00.400
- There, Grandpa disappears too!
 - He is doing well.
 We're doing this now.

335
00:54:00.560 --> 00:54:04.160
Now it's all three ...

336
00:54:04.320 --> 00:54:11.680
You fill your lungs with air and then fill the balloon with a breath.

337
00:54:14.200 --> 00:54:17.840
You are welcome.

338
00:54:36.440 --> 00:54:40.360
There he is!
 What did I say?

339
00:54:40.520 --> 00:54:44.040
-Grandfather!
 -Dad!

340
00:54:44.200 --> 00:54:48.600
We are here now.
 Come here!

341
00:54:48.760 --> 00:54:53.880
- Grandfather, come ashore now!
 -Dad!

342
00:54:57.560 --> 00:55:00.400
Rudolf!
 Rudolf ...

343
00:55:01.800 --> 00:55:06.280
Come here!
 Do you hear me?!

344
00:55:06.440 --> 00:55:11.000
Come here!
 Fucking old man ...

345
00:55:11.160 --> 00:55:14.320
You destroy the whole holiday for us!

346
00:56:31.680 --> 00:56:36.000
