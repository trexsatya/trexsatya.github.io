1
00:00:02,060 --> 00:00:03,400
-Hello.
 -Hello.

2
00:00:03,400 --> 00:00:05,400
- Want to show me around?
 -I can do that.

3
00:00:06,400 --> 00:00:07,860
Where are we now?

4
00:00:08,200 --> 00:00:10,330
Right now we are in the health lab.

5
00:00:10,660 --> 00:00:12,330
What to do here?

6
00:00:13,400 --> 00:00:17,000
Here, students can practice care in a more real environment.

7
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:21,900
For example, you will find nurses in here who practice knitting needles in a fake.

8
00:00:21,900 --> 00:00:24,260
Okay.
 Do you work with real blood then?

9
00:00:24,660 --> 00:00:27,060
No we do not.
 The blood is also fake.

10
00:00:27,160 --> 00:00:29,530
How do you celebrate a exam?

11
00:00:31,340 --> 00:00:34,460
I do not celebrate my exams until I have received the grade, but ...

12
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:36,460
... a big glass of O'boy, maybe.

13
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:39,030
Is the great love of your life here at college?

14
00:00:39,050 --> 00:00:40,330
You never know.

15
00:00:40,900 --> 00:00:43,500
Can you describe Halmstad University in three words?

16
00:00:44,300 --> 00:00:48,830
If I were to describe the college in three words, it would be: best in Sweden.

17
00:00:49,060 --> 00:00:52,330
We were actually voted on the best student city.

18
00:00:52,930 --> 00:00:55,100
Do you have any extra jobs alongside?

19
00:00:55,760 --> 00:00:56,360
I have.

20
00:00:56,380 --> 00:00:59,660
I work as a treatment educator and housing support.

21
00:00:59,860 --> 00:01:01,660
Do you need an extra job?

22
00:01:02,330 --> 00:01:03,300
I think so.

23
00:01:04,100 --> 00:01:08,100
If you waste a little more money, it is good to have an extra job aside.

24
00:01:08,330 --> 00:01:11,200
What is your favorite place on campus?

25
00:01:11,660 --> 00:01:14,600
My favorite place is the library.

26
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:19,640
There are many who sit there and plug, and you get easier into a plug-flow.

27
00:01:19,660 --> 00:01:22,530
What is the most unexpected thing about student life?

28
00:01:22,660 --> 00:01:24,260
The most unexpected is enough-

29
00:01:24,280 --> 00:01:29,260
-That there are so many who are involved in student life outside the plug.

30
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:33,430
And if you come here as new in town you get many friends quite quickly.

31
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:38,430
- Hi, where do you come from?
 - Hi, I come from Iran.

32
00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:41,160
Where are we and what can you do here?

33
00:01:41,630 --> 00:01:44,500
We are in the electronics center in Halmstad.

34
00:01:44,500 --> 00:01:48,200
It is an innovation arena-

35
00:01:48,220 --> 00:01:54,430
-For local companies and a testing room for EMC tests.

36
00:01:54,430 --> 00:01:57,100
What is the best thing about Halmstad?

37
00:01:57,260 --> 00:01:59,800
Sunny TylÃ¶sand and cozy winter nights.

38
00:02:00,430 --> 00:02:03,000
What is unique about Halmstad University?

39
00:02:03,020 --> 00:02:09,260
You can always find at least one person listening to your ideas, even if they are completely crazy.

40
00:02:09,260 --> 00:02:11,130
Excuse me, I have to change shoes.

41
00:02:13,960 --> 00:02:16,660
-Can you any Swedish?
 - Well!

42
00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:20,660
- What can you say?
 - I am called Fujan and I like chocolate.

43
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:22,830
How do you live?

44
00:02:23,530 --> 00:02:27,630
I live in student corridors with a huge kitchen and a large family.

45
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:30,600
Was it difficult to find accommodation?

46
00:02:30,730 --> 00:02:34,160
Not at all.
 I got my accommodation the same day I came here.

47
00:02:35,630 --> 00:02:38,000
Cinnamon buns or meatballs?

48
00:02:38,430 --> 00:02:40,960
A cinnamon bun after meatballs.

49
00:02:41,830 --> 00:02:43,400
Have you found friends for life?

50
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:45,430
Yes, I was lucky enough to find some.

51
00:02:46,230 --> 00:02:48,400
Was it so cold here as you expected?

52
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:52,330
Not at all.
 There is colder and more snow in my hometown.

53
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:55,730
What is the weirdest thing about Swedes?

54
00:02:56,130 --> 00:02:59,800
Lingon jam for the meatballs.
 Come on.

55
00:03:00,760 --> 00:03:02,000
Zlatan or ABBA?

56
00:03:02,300 --> 00:03:03,100
ABBA.

57
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:07,030
Describe Halmstad University in three words.

58
00:03:07,050 --> 00:03:09,960
Innovation, future and community.

59
00:03:12,330 --> 00:03:14,830
Hi, where are we and what can you do here?

60
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:18,430
Right now we are in the digital laboratory center.

61
00:03:18,450 --> 00:03:24,500
Here you can meet researchers, students and teachers at the university-

62
00:03:24,520 --> 00:03:27,260
-And learn all about new technology and digitalisation.

63
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:29,560
Which students usually hang out here?

64
00:03:29,700 --> 00:03:35,630
In here it is usually students from the teacher programs, the community programs-

65
00:03:35,630 --> 00:03:37,230
-and the humanities.

66
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:38,700
How do you live?

67
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:45,900
I live in one via Willhem, which is a private housing company.

68
00:03:46,330 --> 00:03:47,960
Was it difficult to find accommodation?

69
00:03:48,500 --> 00:03:51,330
Yes, it is difficult if you are not out in good time.

70
00:03:51,350 --> 00:03:54,710
I lived in the second place the first half-year-

71
00:03:54,730 --> 00:03:57,030
-And it was via a Facebook ad.

72
00:03:57,860 --> 00:03:59,830
Do you choose gas or movie night?

73
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:01,600
Movie night.

74
00:04:01,860 --> 00:04:03,530
Which one is the favorite movie?

75
00:04:05,430 --> 00:04:09,500
I have to say that is when the lambs are silent.

76
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:12,200
How much do you have to plug?

77
00:04:13,060 --> 00:04:15,010
You plug about 40 hours a week.

78
00:04:15,033 --> 00:04:18,930
But it is different depending on the course it is - but usually 40 hours.

79
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:21,160
Do everyone bike in Halmstad?

80
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:23,160
Yes.

81
00:04:23,630 --> 00:04:25,730
What do you always have with you to an exam?

82
00:04:26,900 --> 00:04:30,260
I always carry the track and Red Bull.

83
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:31,830
It's my two stuff.

84
00:04:32,330 --> 00:04:34,530
What do you always have to do before an exam?

85
00:04:37,160 --> 00:04:43,200
I never plug in the same day but sit at home and take it calmly

86
00:04:43,460 --> 00:04:45,500
-So I will be rested and prepared.

87
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:48,000
Can you train on campus?

88
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:52,900
Yes, you can work out at the sports center, which is a gym with slightly different premises.

89
00:04:53,700 --> 00:04:54,800
What do you prefer to exercise?

90
00:04:55,460 --> 00:04:58,200
I prefer to practice paddle, but now I'm going to go and gym.

91
00:05:00,130 --> 00:05:03,260
Hi, what is the best thing about life as a student?

92
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:04,600
The social, I think.

93
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:07,000
You meet many new friends - I like that.

94
00:05:07,660 --> 00:05:08,600
Where are we now?

95
00:05:08,900 --> 00:05:11,700
Now we are at the Sports Center, which is part of Campus-

96
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:15,260
-And they also have a large gymnasium in here that you can train in.

97
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,860
How is the atmosphere on campus?

98
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:22,600
A little calmer than usual, because much is remotely because of Corona.

99
00:05:23,100 --> 00:05:24,360
But it works well.

100
00:05:24,380 --> 00:05:25,730
It's a good atmosphere.

101
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:27,900
What do you do when you are not plugging?

102
00:05:28,030 --> 00:05:34,700
I practice Thai boxing and other activities with friends - paddle and such.

103
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:37,700
Are any of your courses digital now?

104
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:42,930
They are both and.
 There are lectures and at distance-

105
00:05:42,930 --> 00:05:47,500
-And some are both -ie lecturers filmed at Zoom.

106
00:05:47,900 --> 00:05:49,430
How does it work do you think?

107
00:05:50,230 --> 00:05:51,500
It works well.

108
00:05:52,130 --> 00:05:55,000
Zoom is nice.
 You can be anywhere and see it.

109
00:05:55,230 --> 00:05:59,430
But the lectures give the most and you learn most from being in place.

110
00:06:00,060 --> 00:06:02,800
- Do you drive a lunch box or do you buy lunch?
 -Lunch box.

111
00:06:03,430 --> 00:06:04,800
What is the go-to food box?

112
00:06:05,100 --> 00:06:07,230
It is probably some lens in the moment.

113
00:06:08,300 --> 00:06:09,860
What is Common Core?

114
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:16,100
Common Core is that many different programs go together and mix their knowledge-

115
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:18,860
-And together solves some societal challenge.

116
00:06:19,760 --> 00:06:21,330
How often do you bathe in the sea?

117
00:06:22,330 --> 00:06:25,360
Maybe two to three times a year-

118
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:27,730
-But it might be more now that you live here.

119
00:06:27,830 --> 00:06:30,500
What is the best plug rack?

120
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:33,960
I like the City Library.

121
00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:40,460
If you go down one floor, they have a quiet floor there that works very well.

122
00:06:41,230 --> 00:06:44,730
There I feel that I am most effective.

123
00:06:45,530 --> 00:06:47,830
Where is the best coffee on campus?

124
00:06:48,730 --> 00:06:50,160
I think that is home.

125
00:06:50,330 --> 00:06:51,330
Yes.

126
00:06:51,760 --> 00:06:55,360
But now I'm going to train, so we'll see you.

127
00:06:56,200 --> 00:06:57,460
Hey, where are we now?

128
00:06:57,560 --> 00:07:00,230
Hello, now we are in Fab Lab.

129
00:07:00,500 --> 00:07:01,700
Why is it called Fab Lab?

130
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:05,300
It stands for Fabrication Laboratory and it comes from MIT.

131
00:07:05,500 --> 00:07:07,760
Here you can 3D printing things-

132
00:07:07,780 --> 00:07:11,530
-You can laser things -kind of a little bit of everything possible.

133
00:07:12,500 --> 00:07:14,700
What is the coolest thing that has been 3d-printed here?

134
00:07:15,500 --> 00:07:18,730
Oops there are a lot of cool stuff-

135
00:07:18,730 --> 00:07:22,530
-But I would say a bust in several different colors.

136
00:07:23,300 --> 00:07:25,330
Do you sometimes feel like a genius?

137
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:27,160
Just a crazy one.

138
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:29,760
Why did you choose Halmstad University?

139
00:07:31,030 --> 00:07:32,930
They had a very interesting education-

140
00:07:32,930 --> 00:07:35,800
-And it's a place I've never been to before.

141
00:07:36,100 --> 00:07:37,930
Salstatta or home tent?

142
00:07:38,230 --> 00:07:39,230
Salstatta.

143
00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:40,460
Why?

144
00:07:40,830 --> 00:07:41,930
Much better focus.

145
00:07:42,830 --> 00:07:44,360
Were you on the zero?

146
00:07:44,380 --> 00:07:45,160
Yes.

147
00:07:45,180 --> 00:07:46,200
How was it?

148
00:07:46,330 --> 00:07:47,900
Among the most fun I've done.

149
00:07:48,660 --> 00:07:51,860
Where are you sitting on campus if you want to look for people?

150
00:07:53,730 --> 00:07:58,500
A little odd question, but trade center, at the top with binoculars.

151
00:07:59,330 --> 00:08:01,060
What do you want to work on after graduation?

152
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,800
I hope.

153
00:08:05,100 --> 00:08:08,630
Tell us something that you think most people do not know about college.

154
00:08:09,500 --> 00:08:12,600
They have a very nice sauna at the sports center.

155
00:08:13,330 --> 00:08:14,960
Now my questions are over.

156
00:08:14,980 --> 00:08:16,760
Do you have something you want to add?

157
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:17,960
No.

158
00:08:18,130 --> 00:08:19,700
Should we say hello then?

159
00:08:20,100 --> 00:08:21,660
Yes good bye.
