1
00:00:00,920 --> 00:00:04,487
Right now, everyday life does not really look like we are used to.

2
00:00:04,760 --> 00:00:07,520
Many of our activities are set

3
00:00:07,520 --> 00:00:09,600
And it's easy to feel abandoned.

4
00:00:10,740 --> 00:00:14,200
The uncertainty can make us both powerless and restless.

5
00:00:14,398 --> 00:00:17,120
Maybe much of one's time is about to think about how everyday life

6
00:00:17,120 --> 00:00:18,640
will look like in a couple of weeks

7
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:21,240
Or to feel disappointed with what you are missing out.

8
00:00:21,240 --> 00:00:25,120
That we lose energy and get a little depressed is nothing strange.

9
00:00:25,120 --> 00:00:27,840
But with a little creativity we can do about our plans

10
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:29,240
So that they work even now,

11
00:00:29,240 --> 00:00:31,440
And in this way, get the energy back!

12
00:00:31,440 --> 00:00:33,320
For example, if you play basketball

13
00:00:33,320 --> 00:00:36,960
But that the training with the team is set for some time to come.

14
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:39,160
Go out and play basketball anyway!

15
00:00:39,999 --> 00:00:44,240
You may not be able to be in your regular training hall with the whole team.

16
00:00:44,240 --> 00:00:46,320
But you might be able to bring someone from the team

17
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:48,120
And go to a basketball basket outdoors.

18
00:00:48,440 --> 00:00:50,640
Besides being a fun time with your friends

19
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:53,480
So we feel better when we move.

20
00:00:54,339 --> 00:00:57,840
Exercise and movement increase the levels of serotonin

21
00:00:57,840 --> 00:00:59,560
which regulates our mood.

22
00:00:59,560 --> 00:01:02,360
This means that you will feel less stressed

23
00:01:02,360 --> 00:01:05,120
and happier after you have done a physical activity.

24
00:01:09,687 --> 00:01:12,560
Many people find it really boring to not be able to meet people

25
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:15,280
which is in the risk group or that has some symptoms.

26
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:19,360
But it is possible to spend time without meeting physically.

27
00:01:19,809 --> 00:01:22,280
If a friend or grandfather can't go out right now,

28
00:01:22,280 --> 00:01:23,400
Make them with a video call!

29
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:25,400
- Hello Laura!

30
00:01:26,480 --> 00:01:27,360
- It's good how about you?

31
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:29,320
To see the face of the one we miss

32
00:01:29,320 --> 00:01:31,400
Can also help us get happier!

33
00:01:31,671 --> 00:01:33,120
It's a weird time right now,

34
00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:34,760
But a good tip for feeling better

35
00:01:34,760 --> 00:01:36,080
and get more energy

36
00:01:36,230 --> 00:01:39,160
is to keep doing the things you usually think is fun.

37
00:01:39,160 --> 00:01:42,360
For example, talk to your friends

38
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:43,520
read a book,

39
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:44,440
play video games

40
00:01:44,440 --> 00:01:45,440
Or draw.

41
00:01:46,109 --> 00:01:49,320
And remember to fill with energy by eating regularly.

42
00:01:49,870 --> 00:01:51,400
Try keeping your routines.

43
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:53,960
Get up in the morning and lie down at the usual time in the evening,

44
00:01:53,960 --> 00:01:55,440
So you get enough sleep.

45
00:01:55,909 --> 00:01:58,000
Then the rest will feel much easier!
