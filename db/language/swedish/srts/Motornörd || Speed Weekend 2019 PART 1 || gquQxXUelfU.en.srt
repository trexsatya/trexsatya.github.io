1
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:23,100
This is a fantastic day in Sweden.
 As you can see, it is clear sky.

2
00:01:23,100 --> 00:01:29,220
The ice has frozen overnight and apparently there are very good conditions for today's event.

3
00:01:29,220 --> 00:01:31,140
Something that I look forward to.

4
00:01:31,140 --> 00:01:35,180
-It's just agree with EDD.
 What a fantastic event and what a nice weather.

5
00:01:35,180 --> 00:01:39,820
Before we kick off, what is Speed Weekend?
 We ask someone who knows.

6
00:01:40,140 --> 00:01:42,480
Yes, that was unfortunately my idea.

7
00:01:42,480 --> 00:01:45,680
It might not be my smartest idea in life but fun.

8
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:49,600
My name is Glenn Ocklund and I am the organizer of Speed Weekend.

9
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:52,360
Now it is the eleventh year in a row that is organizing the event.

10
00:01:52,360 --> 00:01:56,860
Most people come to go speed record and it is "Landpeed Record on Ice".

11
00:01:56,860 --> 00:02:00,680
It is about going as fast as you can with the vehicle you have manufactured.

12
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:03,680
You can come to us with any vehicle.

13
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:07,600
The only thing we require is safety on the vehicle and personal protective equipment.

14
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:11,020
We assess each vehicle individually.

15
00:02:11,020 --> 00:02:13,340
We don't say no to anyone.

16
00:02:13,340 --> 00:02:15,720
If you can only maintain safety, it is okay with us.

17
00:02:15,740 --> 00:02:17,320
Thanks so much, hello!

18
00:02:28,940 --> 00:02:33,340
I'm here with CTEK as you might see.
 I've done some things with them.

19
00:02:33,340 --> 00:02:35,220
They said you had to come here.

20
00:02:35,220 --> 00:02:37,380
I had not heard of it before.

21
00:02:37,380 --> 00:02:40,380
Why haven't I heard of this?
 It's absolutely fantastic!

22
00:02:40,380 --> 00:02:44,320
I look forward to seeing all the crazy vehicles that are here.

23
00:02:55,780 --> 00:02:57,380
-What is that for vehicles?

24
00:02:57,380 --> 00:03:03,280
Basically, it is a garden tractor, gocart, motorcycle and a quad bike.

25
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:05,740
As a type of hybrid, you can say.

26
00:03:05,740 --> 00:03:10,860
Much of it is a gocart and motorcycle engine and some parts are taken by the other.

27
00:03:10,860 --> 00:03:14,000
That's where it is even though it looks like a garden tractor.

28
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:17,080
The chassis is built by a gocart.

29
00:03:17,080 --> 00:03:21,480
It is an extended chassis where I have used parts and redone the chassis itself.

30
00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:27,580
A lot to get wheel angles to act as a gocart etc.

31
00:03:27,580 --> 00:03:30,560
It should be able to drive on track with.

32
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:34,920
It works well but the problem is that you do not remain in the seat.

33
00:03:49,960 --> 00:03:52,700
But I don't know if it's good for anything.

34
00:03:52,700 --> 00:03:56,680
But it works to go on the ice and asphalt.

35
00:03:56,680 --> 00:04:01,040
The idea is to drive on an air rack this summer.

36
00:04:01,300 --> 00:04:04,340
It is a Triumph Speed Triple from 2004.

37
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:09,060
It is 955 cc and the engine delivers 120 hp.

38
00:04:09,060 --> 00:04:12,640
-It's pretty good.
 Yes the weight ratio is the same.

39
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:15,180
It weighs around 120 kg.

40
00:04:15,380 --> 00:04:18,220
So power and weight ratio are very good.

41
00:04:18,220 --> 00:04:21,540
It is very interesting to drive.

42
00:04:21,820 --> 00:04:24,825
This is the exchange unit.

43
00:04:24,825 --> 00:04:29,620
The idea was that I would have a foot pedal for the clutch but it got a little crowded.

44
00:04:29,620 --> 00:04:35,080
How should I make this easy.
 Then it became like this just like a motorcycle or cross.

45
00:04:35,320 --> 00:04:40,200
I have put the lever at the forefront and the only thing I do is pull like this.

46
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:46,620
Then the entire slider goes and flexes here with braces.
 I never have to touch that one.

47
00:05:12,220 --> 00:05:14,580
-How quickly did you run earlier today?

48
00:05:14,580 --> 00:05:16,900
I haven't run anything today.

49
00:05:16,905 --> 00:05:19,995
Yesterday I drove 209.6 km/h on average.

50
00:05:20,305 --> 00:05:23,305
-What is the goal today?
 210 km/h I will drive today.

51
00:05:23,305 --> 00:05:26,275
A wonderful day like this is 210 km/h that applies.

52
00:05:46,260 --> 00:05:49,520
-Have you overturned?
 Hehe, not me.

53
00:05:49,540 --> 00:05:52,100
But it looks cool, right?

54
00:05:53,760 --> 00:05:56,900
Here comes a happy Rickard.

55
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:00,960
209 km/h.
 Almost, hahaha.

56
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:04,180
Now it held anyway.

57
00:06:04,180 --> 00:06:07,920
-How did it go?
 According to rumors, it was 209 km/h on average.

58
00:06:07,920 --> 00:06:11,220
It's probably one of the fastest rounds I've run.

59
00:06:11,220 --> 00:06:13,940
-Ope!
 Yes it is fun.

60
00:06:13,940 --> 00:06:16,280
Now I'm going to eat a little.
 Should you have carbon balls?

61
00:06:16,280 --> 00:06:17,700
-Yes maybe.

62
00:06:18,020 --> 00:06:22,000
This is the highlight of the year for us and many others.

63
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:25,420
I visited you in September/October.

64
00:06:25,420 --> 00:06:29,820
And I had never heard of Speed Weekend but now I have seen and understands.

65
00:06:29,820 --> 00:06:32,900
Yes if you like odd things then this is where you are going.

66
00:06:32,940 --> 00:06:38,860
Here is something for everyone.
 Everything from extreme cars of 1000 hp to ...

67
00:06:38,860 --> 00:06:42,980
... home -built stuff that cost SEK 500.
 And everyone can join.

68
00:06:42,980 --> 00:06:46,520
Those who come here and think it sounds a lot have come wrong.

69
00:06:46,520 --> 00:06:48,500
Because that's exactly what it does.
 It sounds a lot.

70
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:55,520
-What is it that is wrong?
 The drive shaft has gone off.

71
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:58,580
I have to knock out the little bit that remains in the diff.

72
00:07:00,740 --> 00:07:03,700
I have to open up so you can access the stuff in there.

73
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:08,160
-Is the goal of getting a scratch to?

74
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:11,135
Well, it's track racing so we cord.

75
00:07:11,140 --> 00:07:14,060
I want to go as much as possible when you're here.

76
00:07:19,660 --> 00:07:22,640
So, cut off the cords so you get rid of it.

77
00:07:32,620 --> 00:07:35,960
Car theme Packing, Best Ever ...

78
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:39,180
-How often?

79
00:07:40,620 --> 00:07:42,480
-There is no one who hears anything now anyway.

80
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:48,460
-Someone slides by with a lawnmower.

81
00:07:48,580 --> 00:07:51,720
This happens if you weld the diff.

82
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:54,540
And that is the cheapest way to get a lockdiff.

83
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:57,540
So it happens well ...

84
00:07:59,075 --> 00:08:01,040
... that it lasts for a while.

85
00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:04,140
-Are you here every year?
 I've been here eleven years in a row.

86
00:08:04,140 --> 00:08:06,060
In all the years that have been.

87
00:08:06,100 --> 00:08:09,360
I usually go with a super seven on the high -speed track.

88
00:08:09,780 --> 00:08:12,340
But this year I just go.

89
00:08:12,880 --> 00:08:15,120
-What is so good about Speed Weekend?

90
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:18,740
You can drink beer in the evening and drive a car during the day and just have fun.

91
00:08:18,740 --> 00:08:22,360
It is a bit special to live on the ice with everyone else like -minded.

92
00:08:22,440 --> 00:08:26,980
There are inventive people who come here.

93
00:08:27,740 --> 00:08:30,260
-How long do you stand standing do you think?

94
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:33,340
It will probably take another hour before I can drive.

95
00:08:33,805 --> 00:08:36,875
Farewell.
 -The the same, good luck!

96
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:39,100
-How long have you been to Speed Weekend?

97
00:08:39,100 --> 00:08:41,280
It is the fifth or sixth year.

98
00:08:41,300 --> 00:08:46,020
I was first here and just looked.
 Then I was here with a friend rode a motorcycle.

99
00:08:46,020 --> 00:08:49,720
Before I built something of my own.

100
00:08:50,060 --> 00:08:52,700
It was a little half secret to find Speed Weekend.

101
00:08:52,700 --> 00:08:55,300
I heard about it a long time ago.

102
00:08:55,300 --> 00:09:02,020
But to find out when it was difficult to googled at the time before you found the right one.

103
00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:04,580
-What do you have for creation out here?

104
00:09:04,580 --> 00:09:08,380
It's a little different, the main creation is a jet -driven Forshaga shopper.

105
00:09:08,380 --> 00:09:13,440
This is where it started and then more things have been added during the year.

106
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:16,660
It's Mobacken Racing's fault really, or ..

107
00:09:16,660 --> 00:09:21,700
Anders Johansson and Olov Selander have built a jet -driven kick.

108
00:09:21,700 --> 00:09:24,800
As they have been driving for many years at Speed Weekend.

109
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:30,540
I started to follow them and thought that a jet engine I had to build.

110
00:09:30,540 --> 00:09:33,600
A kick has them so I have to find something else.

111
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:40,700
Then I saw a Forshaga shopper and thought that behind there is room for a jet engine.

112
00:09:40,700 --> 00:09:45,800
Then a large engine was bought and a shopper then I started building.

113
00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:50,180
The engine is its own made jet engine.

114
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:55,320
Consisting of a turbocharger from a 16 liter Volvo Marindiesel engine.

115
00:09:55,320 --> 00:09:58,440
Turbo weighs 32 kg so it is a decent unit.

116
00:09:58,440 --> 00:10:04,280
On that I have built a burning room where I lead the compressor air.

117
00:10:04,280 --> 00:10:09,100
It drives the turbine before it goes out in a afterburning chamber.

118
00:10:09,100 --> 00:10:12,260
Where more fuel is added for more traction.

119
00:10:12,260 --> 00:10:16,340
It draws three times as much fuel than the basic engine.

120
00:10:16,340 --> 00:10:22,400
It pulls 4 liters a minute so I can run 5 minutes on a tank.

121
00:10:22,400 --> 00:10:25,285
At best if I drive at full power.

122
00:10:25,285 --> 00:10:30,880
-How does it look in the cockpit?
 I sketched out a bit on which analogue meters I needed.

123
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:35,400
Still, I do not look at meters but have full up with other things.

124
00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:37,800
-And the hole in the ceiling?

125
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:44,680
It was so, when I sat down, I didn't get a seat.

126
00:10:44,740 --> 00:10:50,200
My first plan was to put a cup over into plexiglass.

127
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:54,060
The time was not enough so it had to be a hole.

128
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:58,760
Once it was there, I thought it looked right okay anyway.

129
00:10:58,760 --> 00:11:02,740
The helmet sticks out a little out of the hole.

130
00:11:08,580 --> 00:11:11,360
-This is the disadvantage of standing outdoors.

131
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:13,760
Do you think?
 Hahaha.

132
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:16,580
It's such a damn move here.

133
00:11:16,580 --> 00:11:22,520
Yes it is a really nice event if you like noise.

134
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:24,660
-Can you tell me what a vehicle is?

135
00:11:24,680 --> 00:11:27,835
It is an electric -powered ice hunt that I call Propster.

136
00:11:27,840 --> 00:11:30,520
-Where did the idea come from building something like this?

137
00:11:30,520 --> 00:11:33,400
I don't know, you are a little snappy.

138
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:38,300
Then you want to be a little different and have always liked electric drive.

139
00:11:38,300 --> 00:11:42,160
Because you get so much power from small engines.

140
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:47,060
I have built everything myself, but not the engine.

141
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:51,860
Cover and chassis are their own development.

142
00:11:52,180 --> 00:11:55,740
The engine comes from a model aircraft.

143
00:11:55,780 --> 00:11:58,020
It's a Plettenberg.

144
00:11:58,020 --> 00:12:02,400
I have the biggest engine normally but unfortunately it has broken.

145
00:12:02,400 --> 00:12:05,220
So I get to drive with a smaller engine today.

146
00:12:06,040 --> 00:12:09,900
Last year I drove 144 km/h on average and 148 km/h as top speed.

147
00:12:09,900 --> 00:12:11,220
-Wow!

148
00:12:11,220 --> 00:12:16,480
With this engine I have had 143 km/h as top speed.

149
00:12:16,940 --> 00:12:20,920
I hope to be able to drive around it.

150
00:12:20,960 --> 00:12:25,080
I'll charge the batteries now then it will be running in half an hour.

151
00:12:25,080 --> 00:12:27,620
-Good luck!
 Thanks.

152
00:12:27,620 --> 00:12:32,740
And so we have Jonas with the electric ice hunt Propster.

153
00:12:44,520 --> 00:12:47,000
-Is this the latest creation?

154
00:12:47,020 --> 00:12:50,500
Yes it is the latest since you last greeted.

155
00:12:50,860 --> 00:12:52,320
-And what is that?

156
00:12:52,360 --> 00:12:56,040
It is a kick with a pulse dirt engine.

157
00:12:56,040 --> 00:12:59,440
Very poor traction and draws a lot of gasoline.

158
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:01,860
But it sounds good.

159
00:13:01,860 --> 00:13:04,780
Most of them can certify that has been nearby.

160
00:13:27,160 --> 00:13:31,480
I drove 2 km so it pulled 10 liters of gasoline.

161
00:13:31,480 --> 00:13:36,020
I got a soup 10 meters before goal so I slid in.

162
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:39,120
-What speed did you come up in?

163
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:42,660
Don't really know but around 70 km/h I would tip.

164
00:13:42,805 --> 00:13:45,355
Previously, it was unusual if there were participants from other countries.

165
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:47,860
But now there are more and more teams.

166
00:13:47,860 --> 00:13:51,520
This is the only place in the world they run speed competitions on ice.

167
00:13:51,520 --> 00:13:53,220
It's really fun.

168
00:13:53,220 --> 00:13:55,540
Here we have the evening night.

169
00:13:55,540 --> 00:13:57,260
Here we relax.

170
00:13:57,740 --> 00:14:03,560
For those of you born in the 60-70s, remember this children's program.

171
00:14:04,060 --> 00:14:09,140
The TV has lighting so it lights up a nice black and white image in the evening.

172
00:14:09,660 --> 00:14:13,620
I got these furniture from a colleague's parents.

173
00:14:13,620 --> 00:14:17,800
They are nice to have on the ice so we took them.

174
00:14:17,800 --> 00:14:23,880
Speed Weekend also has a prize for best depot and there we have been high for many years.

175
00:14:23,880 --> 00:14:27,060
Both one and two, so we hope for a profit.

176
00:14:27,420 --> 00:14:30,200
-It's a lot of noise.
 There is a lot of sound.

177
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,280
It belongs well, I guess.

178
00:14:33,580 --> 00:14:37,320
We sit in here instead because it sounds so much outside.

179
00:14:37,320 --> 00:14:40,880
There are so many who do noise all the time.

180
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:43,480
-What is the black hole racing?

181
00:14:43,480 --> 00:14:47,240
There are only three poles.
 Me, my brother and Lars-Erik.

182
00:14:47,240 --> 00:14:50,100
Who decided to build fun things.

183
00:14:50,100 --> 00:14:52,740
It started with Speed Weekend.

184
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:55,700
At that time it was in Funäsdalen.

185
00:14:55,700 --> 00:14:58,680
By then Lars-Erik had built Jetsparken that we also have.

186
00:14:59,280 --> 00:15:05,740
We bring it there and we will see how it goes.
 Then it became as it became ...

187
00:15:05,840 --> 00:15:10,220
Many hobbies build a small pulse.

188
00:15:10,220 --> 00:15:14,140
A pulse zeal can be built from an old dairy tube or similar.

189
00:15:14,140 --> 00:15:18,880
The Lars-Erik who came up with the idea of building a kick.
 And I don't know why.

190
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:23,340
And when we wanted to scale up, a kick is not suitable anymore.

191
00:15:23,340 --> 00:15:29,060
Then we thought about using mom's old Yamaha chassis but it was too small so it was custom built instead.

192
00:15:29,060 --> 00:15:31,960
We started with the chassis but it was much easier then.

193
00:15:31,960 --> 00:15:37,100
And then the engine that otherwise took 1.5 years that before we could start.

194
00:15:37,100 --> 00:15:40,380
Then it became optimization because the first engine broke quite immediately.

195
00:15:40,380 --> 00:15:42,580
We had made some stupid design misses.

196
00:15:42,580 --> 00:15:46,760
New design on the engine and suspension on the chassis.

197
00:15:46,760 --> 00:15:49,500
A few years later we made a engine cover.

198
00:15:49,500 --> 00:15:53,300
The second and third generation engine began to become reliable.

199
00:15:53,300 --> 00:15:55,920
Then we started investing in aerodynamics to get up to speed.

200
00:15:55,960 --> 00:16:01,080
The engine we have now inverted in very good sheet metal.

201
00:16:01,080 --> 00:16:04,280
We peeled up the engine a bit.
 It is an iterative process.

202
00:16:04,280 --> 00:16:09,700
What is most critical this time?
 Then we will get it.

203
00:16:10,680 --> 00:16:16,140
Do you see that guy Douglas?
 The engine geek guy in blue pants.

204
00:16:16,180 --> 00:16:19,640
You should follow that guy on Youtube.

205
00:16:19,640 --> 00:16:21,855
Now it is the black hole that is going out and driving.

206
00:16:21,860 --> 00:16:26,920
Wondering if anyone has talked about it being a bump in the ice at the end of the track?

207
00:16:27,080 --> 00:16:30,860
The black hole aims to drive faster than last year.

208
00:16:30,860 --> 00:16:35,540
Which was 241 km/h on average.

209
00:16:36,220 --> 00:16:40,200
Keep your ears good people.

210
00:17:09,160 --> 00:17:12,940
Holy Baloney!
 Totally amazing!

211
00:17:18,120 --> 00:17:21,180
Did you kiss on you?
 Hahahaha!

212
00:17:21,180 --> 00:17:25,360
Would say it is mildly moist.
 That was fantastic!

213
00:17:39,720 --> 00:17:43,000
-It sounds.
 It absolutely does.

214
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:48,000
It doesn't sound as much when sitting on.
 You start to get used to it.

215
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:54,300
It has been proven that it sounds when things break that is too close.

216
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:59,580
Flower pots fall out of the shelves when we start it at home with mom.

217
00:17:59,580 --> 00:18:01,940
It's a bit brutal.

218
00:18:01,940 --> 00:18:05,580
-How many decibels is that?
 Nobody really knows.

219
00:18:05,580 --> 00:18:07,300
But there are very many.

220
00:18:07,300 --> 00:18:11,900
Someone sat indoors 3 miles away and heard it.

221
00:18:12,060 --> 00:18:14,460
-How is it to drive?

222
00:18:14,460 --> 00:18:17,680
Great for the most part.
 But it has to do with the company.

223
00:18:17,680 --> 00:18:21,720
Some of the rides today were a bit unpleasant due to the side wind and it was trackful.

224
00:18:21,720 --> 00:18:26,340
-How much gasoline it pulls?
 There is about 15-20 liters on a scratch.

225
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:28,620
15-20 liters of 2 km?

226
00:18:28,620 --> 00:18:31,400
It's not so good maybe?

227
00:18:31,900 --> 00:18:35,300
But we don't drive with it very often.
 It's not that we commute with it.

228
00:18:43,420 --> 00:18:47,200
It was all for this time but it will be more in the next section.

229
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:50,440
If you like cranky vehicles, check out Brooklyn Choppers

230
00:18:50,440 --> 00:18:52,440
I link to that series in the subtitles.

231
00:18:52,440 --> 00:18:55,220
Thanks for checking!
 We can be seen in the next section.

232
00:18:55,220 --> 00:18:57,520
This is enjoyable.

233
00:18:58,600 --> 00:18:59,800
Great!

234
00:18:59,800 --> 00:19:05,160
The engine went but the hole in the valve is difficult to repair.
