1
00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:45.880
Do you eat candy?

2
00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:50.760
I myself eat fish.

3
00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:57.560
It is raw fish, as in Japan.
 Real raw fish.

4
00:01:57.720 --> 00:02:02.280
It spins like a cat.
 It's brand new.

5
00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:08.280
There are only two copies throughout Scandinavia.
 Yes, Svindyr.

6
00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:13.440
But if you want to be unique, it costs money.

7
00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:18.320
- Word.
 - Paul.

8
00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:24.080
-New car?
 -Yes.
 You with, I see.

9
00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:30.240
This is Lisa, my girlfriend.

10
00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:33.800
This is Nina, my girlfriend.

11
00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:41.200
God, what you are slim, Peter!

12
00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:47.400
You have to bulge up!
 That's why you don't get any girls!

13
00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:50.320
Come.

14
00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:54.320
- Would you like to lie with him?
 -No.

15
00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:57.480
You see!

16
00:02:57.640 --> 00:03:02.280
Welcome!
 Today we celebrate the 10th anniversary.

17
00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:07.840
We offer Russian caviar in the delicacy department.

18
00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:13.800
It is completely free.
 Hurry to make a bargain!

19
00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:20.000
Hello!

20
00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:41.000
To me, it feels like a giant hand is throwing me up in the air.

21
00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:44.480
How wonderful!

22
00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:51.160
To me, it feels like all blood is being thrown back and forth in the body.

23
00:03:51.320 --> 00:03:54.840
An incredibly strong feeling!

24
00:03:56.360 --> 00:04:00.200
Yes, for me it's a bit like ...

25
00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:05.280
... book sale.
 It is important to be there on time.

26
00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:12.840
Check out what a cool pattern!

27
00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:17.240
You can see such a pattern before fainting.

28
00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:24.000
Then Magnus said: "That's my crown!"

29
00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:29.200
No matter how much money you earn, you have no one left.

30
00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:34.400
We have received a salary increase, but do we seem richer?

31
00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:38.040
You have the same old ugly clothes!

32
00:04:38.200 --> 00:04:42.440
It's better not to have that much.

33
00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:47.200
Money makes people weird, that is.

34
00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:53.080
- It is not possible to get rich in Sweden.
 - only on lottery.

35
00:04:53.240 --> 00:04:57.240
But it is very simple.

36
00:04:57.400 --> 00:05:01.160
Have you won the lottery?

37
00:05:01.320 --> 00:05:08.440
We handed in 32-row ironing tips last spring, but we only got 6 right.

38
00:05:08.600 --> 00:05:15.560
But Kristina had crossed the Joker box.
 It gave 23 million.

39
00:05:16.960 --> 00:05:21.120
-No...?
 –23 million?

40
00:05:21.280 --> 00:05:25.200
We have 22.9 left.

41
00:05:25.360 --> 00:05:29.960
It must have changed your lives totally!

42
00:05:30.120 --> 00:05:35.720
- I have not changed anyway.
 - No, you're like you.

43
00:05:35.880 --> 00:05:39.720
My God, you are multi -millionaires!

44
00:05:39.880 --> 00:05:45.720
- We bought a new lamp for the hall.
 - Yes, maybe it was a little unnecessary.

45
00:05:45.880 --> 00:05:51.160
Many people usually give away some money.

46
00:05:51.320 --> 00:05:59.240
- You have friends.
 You have us!
 - Yes, our Volvo is not so good anymore.

47
00:05:59.400 --> 00:06:04.400
We have thought about it back and forth ...

48
00:06:04.560 --> 00:06:10.680
I don't know how it is with you, Kristina, but now I have decided.

49
00:06:13.080 --> 00:06:16.800
You will not get a penny.

50
00:06:19.040 --> 00:06:25.480
That's what you say: Money just destroys people.

51
00:06:27.520 --> 00:06:31.520
- It would be good with coffee.
 - If you can afford it.

52
00:06:44.560 --> 00:06:48.600
How lousy that they test makeup on animals.

53
00:06:48.760 --> 00:06:54.320
What do they know?!
 Surely guinea pigs do not have undergraduate cream?

54
00:07:10.040 --> 00:07:13.120
How wonderful!

55
00:07:15.640 --> 00:07:19.000
You play with the Royal Philharmonic!

56
00:07:19.160 --> 00:07:23.240
How awesome to play an instrument!

57
00:07:23.400 --> 00:07:29.760
- I have some musical talent.
 -What are you playing?

58
00:07:29.920 --> 00:07:32.920
I play on my own body.

59
00:07:33.080 --> 00:07:39.320
I have played a lot for Kristina at home.
 You should hear ...

60
00:07:40.640 --> 00:07:45.680
Sprouting sound

61
00:07:53.000 --> 00:08:00.120
Surely it is a delicious sound?
 I curse my hand over the armpit like this ...

62
00:08:01.200 --> 00:08:05.000
Do you play a lot in Europe?

63
00:08:05.160 --> 00:08:13.200
- I came home from Vienna last week.
 - You have to repeat a lot.

64
00:08:13.360 --> 00:08:19.880
- No, I've always been able to.
 - I meant Sebastian.

65
00:09:10.200 --> 00:09:15.240
- I'm glad it's us, Leon.
 - I too, Robyn.

66
00:09:15.400 --> 00:09:22.680
What is so good about us is that we do not have to make ourselves for men.

67
00:09:22.840 --> 00:09:31.280
We do not need to make up, have panties or breasts ... yes, breasts we have ...

68
00:09:31.440 --> 00:09:37.240
- Can't we cuddle a little ...?
 - It's real stuff!

69
00:09:37.400 --> 00:09:44.000
We don't have to make up, don't have panties or breasts ...

70
00:09:44.160 --> 00:09:49.800
Strong girls do not need panties!
 Are you with me?!

71
00:09:49.960 --> 00:09:54.720
- Yes, I'm with you!
 -It is good.

72
00:09:56.480 --> 00:10:02.640
- Now you have been mucking too!
 - You are no more than human.

73
00:10:02.800 --> 00:10:07.840
- Can't you play anymore?
 - Do you hear?

74
00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:13.240
It's always fun to play a little.
 You start.

75
00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:51.760
We played nicely together.

76
00:11:13.320 --> 00:11:17.400
Go straight ahead and then right here in front.

77
00:11:17.560 --> 00:11:22.840
Well, it's right!
 I thought it was ...

78
00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:26.000
Are there any problems, or ...?

79
00:11:26.160 --> 00:11:29.640
-Is there any problems?!
 –Rbyn ...

80
00:11:29.800 --> 00:11:35.040
-Is there any problems?!
 -No!

81
00:11:35.200 --> 00:11:41.960
-Ouch...!
 - Let moss, Leon!
 Strong girls ...

82
00:11:42.120 --> 00:11:48.800
--... Don't ask for the road.
 - I love you, my little woman!

83
00:11:55.840 --> 00:12:02.280
Tord?
 Here is the report.
 I have worked with it all weekend.

84
00:12:02.440 --> 00:12:08.560
I think it seems a little bad.
 I'm doing this ...

85
00:12:11.160 --> 00:12:17.240
- There you deleted my report.
 -That's right.

86
00:12:18.720 --> 00:12:22.960
- Is this your mobile?
 -Yes.

87
00:12:24.760 --> 00:12:30.680
- There you put my mobile in mineral water.
 -Yes, Loka water.

88
00:12:38.840 --> 00:12:42.560
May I ask you to stand up?

89
00:12:43.560 --> 00:12:47.280
Turn to me.

90
00:12:47.440 --> 00:12:50.720
A little wider between the legs ...

91
00:12:56.720 --> 00:12:59.720
There you kicked me on my scrotum.

92
00:12:59.880 --> 00:13:04.120
- I will give you a Danish skull.
 -Yes.

93
00:13:06.280 --> 00:13:10.800
FIGHT

94
00:13:23.960 --> 00:13:31.200
- What do you do, Leon?
 - Nothing, I'm just standing here and ...

95
00:13:31.360 --> 00:13:37.360
... thought of all the girls with string panties.
 Look, just a strap in the ass!

96
00:13:37.520 --> 00:13:44.040
You might think you were going to buy a pair of string panties.

97
00:13:44.200 --> 00:13:48.600
-No!
 - Sound mash, Leon.

98
00:13:48.760 --> 00:13:53.280
- Strong girls ... --... don't have panties.

99
00:13:53.440 --> 00:13:58.800
Now we look at the Wheel loader.
 And you, we don't go here.

100
00:14:15.760 --> 00:14:18.360
Stay!

101
00:14:19.960 --> 00:14:28.680
As a customer you should feel that you are in good hands.
 We stand for security ...

102
00:14:28.840 --> 00:14:34.640
-Ah!
 - I will kill you, yours ...!

103
00:14:54.080 --> 00:15:00.280
That's one thing I've been thinking about for a long time, but never said, Carita.

104
00:15:00.440 --> 00:15:06.360
- I think you have beautiful eyes.
 -Per-Arne ...!
 That was nicely put.

105
00:15:06.520 --> 00:15:13.120
- Now I said it anyway.
 -Yes you did.

106
00:15:15.080 --> 00:15:20.920
That is another thing that I have never said either.

107
00:15:22.240 --> 00:15:25.400
Those earrings ...

108
00:15:25.560 --> 00:15:28.560
They don't dress.

109
00:15:28.720 --> 00:15:34.280
- I have had since we met.
 -Yes.

110
00:15:34.440 --> 00:15:40.800
- Then I take them well.
 - Do you want to do it, Carita?

111
00:15:40.960 --> 00:15:45.520
-Yes.
 - I love you, Carita.

112
00:15:45.680 --> 00:15:48.920
I love you, Per-Arne.

113
00:15:51.680 --> 00:15:57.360
But it's probably best that I take care of them.

114
00:15:57.520 --> 00:16:01.280
Now it feels better ...

115
00:16:11.160 --> 00:16:17.680
This is that the size does not matter any role is true.

116
00:16:17.840 --> 00:16:23.080
If he has a small, you can still go in a cool car.

117
00:16:23.240 --> 00:16:27.720
Honey, I've made a little verse.

118
00:16:27.880 --> 00:16:32.800
It is about how it should be here at home.

119
00:16:32.960 --> 00:16:38.400
"The doormat should lie against the threshold if I do not want to beg."

120
00:16:38.560 --> 00:16:44.640
"And in the lower cabinet, woe and horror, there is a pink cloth" -

121
00:16:44.800 --> 00:16:51.160
- "As used for sinks only, I don't want to be my wife to load."

122
00:16:51.320 --> 00:16:54.320
"The toilet lid I close with haste" -

123
00:16:54.480 --> 00:16:58.640
- "And the towel to the right when I cleaned my Task."

124
00:16:58.800 --> 00:17:03.120
The last is an emergency rhyme.

125
00:17:10.560 --> 00:17:13.160
Stop!

126
00:17:33.320 --> 00:17:40.320
-Good day.
 I want to talk to a priest.
 - Yes, it's going well.

127
00:17:40.480 --> 00:17:44.600
I am the priest, then.
 Stefan Elmers steel.

128
00:17:44.760 --> 00:17:48.400
Gun my name is ...

129
00:17:49.560 --> 00:17:53.240
What can I serve with, Gun?

130
00:17:53.400 --> 00:17:59.280
What do you think, Stefan, that you can be at service?

131
00:17:59.440 --> 00:18:05.480
Maybe I should not think so much.
 Do you want guidance?

132
00:18:05.640 --> 00:18:12.800
- Do you feel for Jesus?
 - Yes, they hung him on a cross!

133
00:18:12.960 --> 00:18:17.600
Jesus died for our sins.

134
00:18:17.760 --> 00:18:22.280
Now we need each grogg, Stefan.

135
00:18:22.440 --> 00:18:30.000
- It is an alcohol ban here.
 - You can't live by ban.

136
00:18:30.160 --> 00:18:34.960
- If you ... - bowl!
 Take it!

137
00:18:37.440 --> 00:18:41.560
-Bowl.
 -Bowl...

138
00:18:46.480 --> 00:18:49.480
Is there anything that weighs your heart?

139
00:18:49.640 --> 00:18:55.520
When you look at such a neighbor guy as you feel the heart as a bird.

140
00:18:55.680 --> 00:18:59.840
I'm just here to help you ...

141
00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:06.640
If you want to help me, just come and pick!

142
00:19:06.800 --> 00:19:12.760
- It doesn't go for itself ... - Inger!
 - Stefan!

143
00:19:12.920 --> 00:19:16.400
-Do you drink?!
 -Sorry...

144
00:19:16.560 --> 00:19:21.560
Come on, Steffi, don't be so stiff!
 Came back!

145
00:19:21.720 --> 00:19:24.960
Hello!
 Stefan!

146
00:19:25.120 --> 00:19:28.840
What are you looking at?!

147
00:19:47.360 --> 00:19:53.160
- Mom had some buns in the freezer.
 - Mom's good buns.

148
00:19:53.320 --> 00:19:57.160
She could bake buns!

149
00:19:57.320 --> 00:20:03.360
- This day we will split the estate.
 - I take a bun.

150
00:20:03.520 --> 00:20:11.640
Mom wanted us to do it ourselves.
 We can go through the house.

151
00:20:11.800 --> 00:20:18.080
- It sounds like a good idea.
 - We start with the most valuable ...

152
00:20:18.240 --> 00:20:21.320
Wasn't there five buns?

153
00:20:22.720 --> 00:20:27.120
This board is a genuine Wirhem-Wiik.

154
00:20:27.280 --> 00:20:33.760
Here Mom has written a note: "The Tavvla ..." She has spelled wrong.

155
00:20:33.920 --> 00:20:40.840
"This painting will his few. Mom, Stockholm in 1963."

156
00:20:41.000 --> 00:20:45.440
May I look at the note ...?

157
00:20:45.600 --> 00:20:52.280
- It says "Manpower" on the note!
 - There you work, Hans.

158
00:20:52.440 --> 00:20:59.120
- Mom liked a lot of manpower.
 - Manpower was not in 1963.

159
00:20:59.280 --> 00:21:04.400
There was certainly something called so.
 Domus was called Konsum.

160
00:21:04.560 --> 00:21:10.800
- Ohléns was certainly called Manpower then.
 - No, it's called Tempo.

161
00:21:10.960 --> 00:21:17.120
- How to explain it, his?
 - It was a little chance.

162
00:21:18.520 --> 00:21:22.560
But you revealed me ...

163
00:21:22.720 --> 00:21:26.840
Then I remove the note.

164
00:21:27.920 --> 00:21:32.240
- I love that clock!
 -Me too.

165
00:21:32.400 --> 00:21:36.440
Here says a new note: "This Wise ..."

166
00:21:37.440 --> 00:21:41.320
Ouch.
 A little chance.

167
00:22:28.440 --> 00:22:35.360
- Here's nothing.
 - It may need better light.

168
00:22:38.480 --> 00:22:41.880
Wasn't there five buns?

169
00:22:46.440 --> 00:22:49.960
There is something on the clock.

170
00:22:53.080 --> 00:22:56.240
"This clock should Marianne have."

171
00:22:56.400 --> 00:22:59.400
Signed "Marianne 1987".

172
00:22:59.560 --> 00:23:02.640
No ... "Mom 1987 ..."

173
00:23:33.280 --> 00:23:38.320
So, old man.

174
00:23:41.040 --> 00:23:43.800
So yes!

175
00:23:43.960 --> 00:23:51.240
Can't we do this as adults?
 Everyone will probably be satisfied.

176
00:23:52.320 --> 00:23:56.080
- What are you eating on, Ingrid?
 -Nothing...

177
00:23:56.240 --> 00:24:02.160
- It's Magnus Bulle!
 - No, it didn't say "Magnus" on it!

178
00:24:02.320 --> 00:24:07.720
It doesn't say "Magnus" on it either, so it's mine!

179
00:24:22.440 --> 00:24:28.120
Tord and Paul ... We'll sing to Gudrun.
 She is 40 years old.

180
00:24:28.280 --> 00:24:32.960
- Yeah!
 40 years already ... the years go by.

181
00:25:12.280 --> 00:25:16.680
Kristina!
 "God of love" in four letters?

182
00:25:16.840 --> 00:25:19.840
"Phil"!
 Dr. Phil!

183
00:25:20.000 --> 00:25:23.880
Yes, it goes in.

184
00:25:27.440 --> 00:25:30.560
"Tenderness", what could it be?

185
00:25:30.720 --> 00:25:34.000
"Non-existent."

186
00:25:34.160 --> 00:25:39.480
This one then ... "can get worse?"

187
00:25:39.640 --> 00:25:42.800
"Nothing."

188
00:25:45.560 --> 00:25:49.960
One to cute little stone!

189
00:25:52.680 --> 00:25:56.880
Oh!
 Look, a tuler!

190
00:26:00.280 --> 00:26:03.960
God!
 Look, what nice colors!

191
00:26:04.960 --> 00:26:07.200
Come!

192
00:26:13.280 --> 00:26:18.560
- River, which stone is the cutest?
 -This.

193
00:26:19.680 --> 00:26:25.200
Well.
 Which one do you think is the second cutest?

194
00:26:26.360 --> 00:26:31.160
-The.
 - Yeah, do you think so?

195
00:26:31.320 --> 00:26:38.080
- What is the second most cute?
 - It, then it and then it.

196
00:26:38.240 --> 00:26:41.240
Over and out.
 Good night!

197
00:26:41.400 --> 00:26:45.960
- What is it wrong with it?
 -Nothing.

198
00:26:46.120 --> 00:26:52.840
- What is it, Kristina?
 - I don't feel really relaxed.

199
00:26:53.000 --> 00:26:58.440
-Don't you like the Raff set?
 - It feels uncomfortable.

200
00:26:58.600 --> 00:27:02.200
Come on, don't be so stiff!

201
00:27:19.560 --> 00:27:23.560
