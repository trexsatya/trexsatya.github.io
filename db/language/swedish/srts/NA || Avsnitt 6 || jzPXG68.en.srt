00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:42.240
- Welcome to shrimp frozen.
 -Last episode!
 It feels sad.

2
00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:47.040
- How does it feel to you?
 -Good!

3
00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:54.440
I've been here every week.
 It has been really nice.

4
00:00:54.600 --> 00:01:01.240
I also appreciate that there has been free admission.
 Free is good!

5
00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:05.560
A little thing just ...

6
00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:12.360
I have traveled taxi back and forth for a pretty small sum ...

7
00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:18.440
- How do we solve that bit?
 -What do you mean?

8
00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:25.400
Travel allowance, etc.
 I have receipts, so there should be no ...

9
00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:30.200
We cannot pay people's travels here.

10
00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:39.240
But it will be very expensive, this!

11
00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:49.920
Have you had a good week?

12
00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:55.920
Yes.
 I have had visits from relatives from Germany.

13
00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:13.080
Have you done any fun this week?

14
00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:17.880
Last Tuesday I shaved off my pubic hair.

15
00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:23.880
I am really pleased.
 Everyone says I look 20 years younger.

16
00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:28.880
- You have always been a little vain.
 -You also.

17
00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:33.280
Yesterday I would buy a t -shirt.

18
00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:47.800
-Can I help you?
 - There are only three t -shirts here.

19
00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:55.280
Sure, but what a quality!
 Feel the material. This is not a dozen.

20
00:02:55.440 --> 00:03:02.080
- It's too small, huh?
 - It's stretchable.

21
00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:12.240
- I don't get over my shoulders.
 - Can't the first time, but ...

22
00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:19.040
This is an Italian product that stretches 35-40 % after washing.

23
00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:25.920
If it does not work, you can lose weight into the garment.
 This one fits perfectly!

24
00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:31.480
- I should look at another deal ... - no, no!

25
00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:38.760
Nilsson, a customer needs help finding pants in the right size.

26
00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:45.760
- I am looking for a t -shirt.
 - interested in a pair of stylish pants?

27
00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:53.240
No.
 If you do not have a t -shirt in my size, I go somewhere else.

28
00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:57.360
We have lots of t -shirts.
 Here!

29
00:03:57.520 --> 00:04:03.480
- They are too small.
 - It's a stretch material.

30
00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:08.320
I have heard that once before.

31
00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:15.120
We have more T -shirts at the warehouse.
 I pick them up.
 I'll be right back.

32
00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:23.560
- I found one that fits.
 - This is your t -shirt!

33
00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:30.520
- No, it was behind some boxes.
 - You have taken off your sweater!

34
00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:37.320
- Yes, it was a little warm ... - it's a coffee splendor there.

35
00:04:37.480 --> 00:04:40.920
It is Italian design.

36
00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:47.920
It represents a coffee splendor, but it is really the T -shirt's "logo".

37
00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:55.000
-Lacoste has a crocodile ... - it's a little wet too.

38
00:04:55.160 --> 00:04:59.120
Half price?
 - Nilsson!

39
00:05:01.440 --> 00:05:08.080
Pile into the warehouse and see if there are more t -shirts behind any box.

40
00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:15.080
Nilsson goes in and looks if there are more T -shirts behind any box.

41
00:05:15.240 --> 00:05:21.880
- I found it here in the warehouse!
 - This is your t -shirt!

42
00:05:22.040 --> 00:05:28.240
- Well!
 I have hung it off.
 - And no pants either ...!

43
00:05:28.400 --> 00:05:34.640
- I took off my p.g.a.
 the heat.
 - It's so hot in the warehouse.

44
00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:41.440
- We ignore this.
 Bye.
 - interested in Italian underwear?

45
00:05:45.640 --> 00:05:52.280
What strange deal?
 It was like a sketch.

46
00:05:53.520 --> 00:05:57.400
So you filmed your clothing purchase?

47
00:05:57.560 --> 00:06:04.480
The salesmen were similar to the actors from Änglagård and the hunters.

48
00:06:04.640 --> 00:06:10.040
You stand with both feet firmly on earth, David.

49
00:06:10.200 --> 00:06:13.440
Oh really?
 Thanks.

50
00:06:13.600 --> 00:06:21.080
You do not change when you become known but it does people around one.

51
00:06:21.240 --> 00:06:27.680
I feel a huge pressure to always be extra nice.

52
00:06:27.840 --> 00:06:34.080
You say yes to stuff that you don't really want to do.

53
00:06:34.240 --> 00:06:41.600
My mom called and asked if I wanted to be plot on Christmas Eve.

54
00:06:41.760 --> 00:06:48.000
I said, "Mom, you have to ask my manager."

55
00:06:48.160 --> 00:06:52.960
“What kind of gage?” I ask.

56
00:06:53.120 --> 00:06:56.720
"0 SEK," she said.

57
00:06:56.880 --> 00:07:02.680
I said, "Mom, I have my own TV program."

58
00:07:02.840 --> 00:07:08.360
"I don't let go of a fish for under ten sheets".

59
00:07:08.520 --> 00:07:12.760
You must not let people drive with you.

60
00:07:12.920 --> 00:07:19.560
To perform free you only do where there are important people in the audience.

61
00:07:19.720 --> 00:07:26.120
Exactly!
 I said: "Mom, who do I have in the audience? It's Grandpa" -

62
00:07:26.280 --> 00:07:32.360
- "And Uncle Åke who has not had a job since the shipyard crisis - 79!"

63
00:07:32.520 --> 00:07:39.360
But you are kind, so I said, "Okay, you are my parents."

64
00:07:39.520 --> 00:07:45.880
"Five sheets. For that money I am plot" -

65
00:07:46.040 --> 00:07:50.680
- "And hand out the Christmas presents."

66
00:07:50.840 --> 00:07:56.520
"In addition, you get access to me at Christmas dinner."

67
00:07:56.680 --> 00:08:00.200
People use one all the time.

68
00:08:00.360 --> 00:08:06.800
My acid wanted me to become a godfather to her son.

69
00:08:06.960 --> 00:08:10.800
I didn't want to be nonchalant-

70
00:08:10.960 --> 00:08:16.200
- So I sent my assistant to baptism.

71
00:08:16.360 --> 00:08:24.000
You are too kind.
 The acid didn't even send me a thank you card.

72
00:08:25.120 --> 00:08:31.760
Hello, everyone!
 Have you thought about this with Göran Persson?

73
00:08:41.440 --> 00:08:47.080
Is Ingvar Carlsson not like a shoe with glasses?

74
00:08:51.200 --> 00:08:55.240
When I appear I usually say:

75
00:08:55.400 --> 00:09:02.400
"Let the politicians put on you, but never let them sit on you."

76
00:09:02.560 --> 00:09:09.200
And when you have been out and supit and are back then after ...

77
00:09:09.360 --> 00:09:16.200
Then you are always so thirsty.
 Why?
 You have been drinking all evening!

78
00:09:16.360 --> 00:09:20.840
Now I'm going to make an extra number.

79
00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:27.640
I'll mimic an animal.
 Which animal in the jungle am I now?

80
00:09:44.080 --> 00:09:50.240
-Hello.
 Two to the "sixth mind".
 - It's an exciting movie.

81
00:09:50.400 --> 00:09:53.840
Bruce Willis plays child psychologist.

82
00:09:54.000 --> 00:10:00.640
He should help a little boy who can see ghosts and kill people.

83
00:10:00.800 --> 00:10:07.720
But it turns out that Bruce Willis is one of the dead people.

84
00:10:07.880 --> 00:10:11.720
Be so good - two tickets.

85
00:10:12.880 --> 00:10:16.720
Hello.
 A ticket to the "sixth mind".

86
00:10:16.880 --> 00:10:22.520
Bruce Willis is one of the dead people.
 - Next!

87
00:10:35.240 --> 00:10:40.880
Even the one who has their garden on the balcony -

88
00:10:41.040 --> 00:10:47.480
- Can enjoy the summer's lovely, home -grown vegetables:

89
00:10:47.640 --> 00:10:54.280
Tomatoes, radishes to crunch and salad leaves to pinch.

90
00:10:54.440 --> 00:10:58.280
I myself am fond of tomatoes.

91
00:10:58.440 --> 00:11:04.920
They are easily grown.
 You can have them on both terrace and balcony.

92
00:11:05.080 --> 00:11:10.720
As the fruits grow, they are tied up.

93
00:11:10.880 --> 00:11:16.680
When buying tomatoes to be planted -

94
00:11:16.840 --> 00:11:22.760
- So you should take a variety that is for outdoor drive.

95
00:11:22.920 --> 00:11:26.200
There are many different varieties -

96
00:11:26.360 --> 00:11:32.680
- Everything from small cocktail tomatoes to large stifling tomatoes.

97
00:11:32.840 --> 00:11:37.800
The unusual varieties are not cheap.

98
00:11:37.960 --> 00:11:44.640
Buying tomatoes is like buying whores - tastes it, so it costs!

99
00:11:44.800 --> 00:11:51.880
It was great.
 It was just the last thing that sounded a bit strange.

100
00:11:52.040 --> 00:11:55.680
Did I stumble on the words, or ...?

101
00:11:55.840 --> 00:12:01.680
No.
 But what you said about tomatoes and prostitutes ...

102
00:12:01.840 --> 00:12:08.280
I wanted it to be a humorous grumble on it all.

103
00:12:08.440 --> 00:12:14.080
The problem is that whores are such a strong word.

104
00:12:14.240 --> 00:12:20.480
Maybe I should say Luder instead?
 Tjack - Luder?
 Spray -Luder?

105
00:12:20.640 --> 00:12:28.320
- It's best to ignore it.
 - Can we fix it in the editing?

106
00:12:33.080 --> 00:12:38.320
Welcome, actor Josef Berens.

107
00:12:44.680 --> 00:12:51.120
Welcome!
 This is what you look like in your parade role - Bobo Chicken.

108
00:12:51.280 --> 00:12:56.560
I have designed Bobo for eight seasons.

109
00:12:56.720 --> 00:13:00.560
I'm starting to feel close to him now.

110
00:13:00.720 --> 00:13:06.560
You are mascot at the fast -food restaurant Mr Chicken.

111
00:13:06.720 --> 00:13:13.320
- And that's when you dance?
 -Yes.
 The dance is an important tool.

112
00:13:13.480 --> 00:13:20.120
I carry a toolbox with different things in, e.g.
 dance.

113
00:13:20.280 --> 00:13:24.120
Pantomim is another.

114
00:13:24.280 --> 00:13:28.120
"Chicken goes into wall".

115
00:13:28.280 --> 00:13:34.120
The floor mop is also an important tool for you.

116
00:13:34.280 --> 00:13:40.920
As a player, you can't shut out any of what is happening in the room.

117
00:13:41.080 --> 00:13:45.320
Presence must always be total.

118
00:13:45.480 --> 00:13:52.120
If anyone spills anything, do you have to dry it up?

119
00:13:52.280 --> 00:13:57.520
You can see me at Hotel Malmen in Stockholm -

120
00:13:57.680 --> 00:14:00.920
- When I have a beer at the bar.

121
00:14:04.600 --> 00:14:10.280
Fired?
 No, I resigned.

122
00:14:10.440 --> 00:14:17.280
The advertising industry was too superficial.
 "Father to hell," I didn't say, but ...

123
00:14:17.440 --> 00:14:22.880
I want to work with real people.
 I am a warehouse worker.

124
00:14:23.040 --> 00:14:29.480
- Nice workmates?
 - Cannon guys!
 But they super much.

125
00:14:29.640 --> 00:14:35.440
The staff party last week was ... oh, oh, oh!

126
00:14:35.600 --> 00:14:39.800
It was completely senseless!

127
00:14:46.680 --> 00:14:51.920
We are group -conscious guys.
 No prestige!

128
00:14:52.080 --> 00:14:55.920
But that's the case with authorities.

129
00:14:56.080 --> 00:15:02.720
Someone has not settled with the dad, so the manager may take that geese ...

130
00:15:06.280 --> 00:15:09.320
Fuck you, Olsson!

131
00:15:09.480 --> 00:15:15.560
I'm gonna kill you!
 - Get your hands off me!

132
00:15:15.720 --> 00:15:22.160
They bend properly. It is even someone who derails when partying.

133
00:15:22.320 --> 00:15:25.440
It's sad.

134
00:15:25.600 --> 00:15:29.440
Calm down now, for the hell!

135
00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:38.200
Olsson!
 I'm Gonna Kill You, Olsson!
 Fuck you, Olsson!

136
00:15:38.360 --> 00:15:42.560
Well, it's my working pole.

137
00:15:42.720 --> 00:15:47.960
I think we have the right fun anyway at the parties.

138
00:15:48.120 --> 00:15:51.760
Their stuff is not my problem.

139
00:15:51.920 --> 00:15:58.400
I have to move on.
 I'm going on a job interview.
 See ya!

140
00:16:04.400 --> 00:16:10.840
For the last time we welcome our optimist consultant Henrik Elmér!

141
00:16:16.960 --> 00:16:20.440
Here I am!

142
00:16:23.640 --> 00:16:27.120
The minute of revenge has arrived!

143
00:16:27.280 --> 00:16:33.720
This is my f.d.
 Girlfriend Gunilla and her new guy Jörgen.

144
00:16:33.880 --> 00:16:39.520
Look, what a strange nose Jörgen has!

145
00:16:39.680 --> 00:16:43.680
It is the same as Gunillas.
 Nöff!

146
00:16:43.840 --> 00:16:49.920
We have practiced this song all night!

147
00:16:53.680 --> 00:16:59.440
  It was the way she took butter on the bread that made me understand

148
00:16:59.600 --> 00:17:04.800
  that it was meant by fate that it would be we two

149
00:17:04.960 --> 00:17:10.480
  She not only spread to her butter as others do - o no

150
00:17:10.640 --> 00:17:16.600
  She took my hand in her and then she brows her butter on me

151
00:17:16.760 --> 00:17:21.600
  It couldn't be misunderstood - sandwich!

152
00:17:26.480 --> 00:17:30.720
  I lit up and wanted to dance maybe it was stupid

153
00:17:30.880 --> 00:17:37.320
  However, I chose to chance for I imagined 'nothing scary

154
00:17:37.480 --> 00:17:43.920
  Then lighten 'something more - a knife!
 She cuts' up me raw - o no

155
00:17:44.080 --> 00:17:50.680
  And soon there was as a result of her crime - two me!

156
00:17:50.840 --> 00:17:56.280
  I might have misunderstood for good!

157
00:18:02.960 --> 00:18:08.360
  Soon I was lying there in her forehead, cut and in butter

158
00:18:08.520 --> 00:18:13.720
  I thought the feelings were true, but now I feel tender

159
00:18:13.880 --> 00:18:19.760
  And the last jump is extinguished iity she invited a new one - o no!

160
00:18:19.920 --> 00:18:25.840
  She is in love with another man and on their menu stands me!

161
00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:31.640
  I saw how she took butter on the bread without understanding

162
00:18:33.640 --> 00:18:37.080
  How it would go!

163
00:18:50.520 --> 00:18:56.960
Do you think Henrik is the best optimist consultant we could get?

164
00:18:57.120 --> 00:19:00.760
No.
 It may not have been so successful.

165
00:19:00.920 --> 00:19:07.360
You might say that it has been unsuccessful.
 That's how I feel.

166
00:19:07.520 --> 00:19:11.360
What have we learned from this?

167
00:19:11.520 --> 00:19:18.360
I have learned that the next time you say you have met a nice guy -

168
00:19:18.520 --> 00:19:23.160
–Am I see it as a warning bell

169
00:19:23.320 --> 00:19:30.160
Next time, before we give a severely disturbed people a forum in national television -

170
00:19:30.320 --> 00:19:34.720
- So we look with each other.
 Good!

171
00:19:44.280 --> 00:19:48.160
Do you remember when his offered kissogram.

172
00:19:48.320 --> 00:19:54.200
Do you remember what I said?
 "Kiss me in the ass!"
 Fuck!

173
00:19:54.360 --> 00:20:00.600
Do you remember when Börje invited us to a porn show in Vaasa?

174
00:20:00.760 --> 00:20:07.400
And Raimo, Tokfinnen, said: Satan, what here smells of fish!

175
00:20:08.560 --> 00:20:12.400
What a crazy guy, huh!

176
00:20:13.800 --> 00:20:21.280
Old men, we've done a damn good job.
 That's why I have a surprise!

177
00:20:21.440 --> 00:20:27.680
I've taken a comedian from TV - stand -up -guy David!

178
00:20:29.120 --> 00:20:36.440
Hello!
 This with a sauna ... Why is it so damn hot in the sauna?

179
00:20:36.600 --> 00:20:40.880
What if it was cold in the sauna?

180
00:20:41.040 --> 00:20:48.480
"It's ice on the floor! We freeze to death! Oh, how cold it is!"

181
00:20:53.320 --> 00:21:00.160
The most common question we get is: When does tap water become unfit to drink?

182
00:21:00.320 --> 00:21:05.560
We take SVT's public service assignment seriously.

183
00:21:05.720 --> 00:21:09.280
That is why we intend to try water.

184
00:21:09.440 --> 00:21:13.280
This water is from the kitchen here.

185
00:21:13.440 --> 00:21:19.280
It is a clear and healthy water.
 I'll try it.

186
00:21:21.000 --> 00:21:27.840
Ordinary Swedish tap water.
 We have access to good water in our homes.

187
00:21:28.000 --> 00:21:34.560
This water has been standing for a week.
 It's not as clear.

188
00:21:36.920 --> 00:21:43.160
The taste is fat, but you can still drink.

189
00:21:43.320 --> 00:21:47.160
So - we have good water in Sweden.

190
00:21:50.360 --> 00:21:54.680
Thanks!
 We move on in the program.

191
00:21:54.840 --> 00:22:01.680
This glass of water I found in my apartment six months ago -

192
00:22:01.840 --> 00:22:05.480
- When I moved in.

193
00:22:05.640 --> 00:22:12.480
- It's at least six months old?
 -Yes.
 It's yellow and smells awful.

194
00:22:12.640 --> 00:22:16.280
We'll try this water.

195
00:22:18.440 --> 00:22:23.920
Oh, fuck!
 It's a very disgusting water!

196
00:22:24.080 --> 00:22:29.120
-Can I taste?
 - It is very disgusting!

197
00:22:29.280 --> 00:22:32.520
This is bad!

198
00:22:34.120 --> 00:22:37.280
Very bad water!

199
00:22:37.440 --> 00:22:43.880
Avoid drinking water that is six months old.

200
00:22:44.040 --> 00:22:50.880
Hope you are happy with the answer.
 It is your license money that finances ...

201
00:22:51.040 --> 00:22:53.880
FART!

202
00:22:54.040 --> 00:22:58.360
... our program operations.
 Excuse...

203
00:23:00.560 --> 00:23:07.400
SVT should be people -forming.
 Certainly it should be invested in entertainment -

204
00:23:07.560 --> 00:23:15.000
- But there should be entertainment where the brain is included, and not just trams.

205
00:23:15.160 --> 00:23:20.880
It is even more important in today's TV selection.

206
00:23:21.040 --> 00:23:26.800
We must give room for reflection and depth.

207
00:23:26.960 --> 00:23:30.800
We must have a high lowest level.

208
00:23:37.360 --> 00:23:44.200
There is talk of a crisis in Swedish television drama, and I agree.

209
00:23:46.360 --> 00:23:53.000
As a young playwright, you have a responsibility to pass on the relay -stick -

210
00:23:53.160 --> 00:23:57.200
- As you got from Bergman, Molin and others.

211
00:23:57.360 --> 00:24:04.960
It's probably about letting through some incomplete script ...

212
00:24:05.120 --> 00:24:12.520
And young people who are not mature to do TV can still do it.

213
00:24:12.680 --> 00:24:16.640
It may not be so successful.

214
00:24:16.800 --> 00:24:19.840
Maybe we should ...

215
00:24:25.240 --> 00:24:31.800
- You don't feel good, Johan?
 -No.
 Here I have a water ...

216
00:24:31.960 --> 00:24:39.800
... which comes from my grandfather's floor - well.
 It is at least two years old.

217
00:24:39.960 --> 00:24:43.800
This is a very bad water!

218
00:24:44.320 --> 00:24:47.400
Okay - then we drive!

219
00:24:49.000 --> 00:24:52.560
Why are we doing this?

220
00:25:00.120 --> 00:25:02.960
Oh, God!

221
00:25:03.120 --> 00:25:06.960
It is expensive to do TV.

222
00:25:07.120 --> 00:25:13.280
This water test, which has been going on for two minutes -

223
00:25:13.440 --> 00:25:17.280
- Costs almost SEK 40,000.

224
00:25:19.960 --> 00:25:26.800
Many people say that for that money we can get a number of hip joint operations.

225
00:25:26.960 --> 00:25:30.800
But quality must cost money.

226
00:25:32.800 --> 00:25:38.440
- How are you, Johan?
 -Very bad.

227
00:25:38.600 --> 00:25:42.440
It must be the water.

228
00:25:42.600 --> 00:25:46.440
Before we finish shrimp, so ...

229
00:25:46.600 --> 00:25:53.040
Here I have a kebab.
 I found it in a rock pocket.

230
00:25:53.200 --> 00:25:57.440
It has been there since New Year's Eve –94.

231
00:25:57.600 --> 00:26:01.800
We will try if it can eat.

232
00:26:01.960 --> 00:26:05.200
Thank you and goodbye!

233
00:27:08.440 --> 00:27:15.280
A peculiar species in Swedish folk art is the wall and roof painting.

234
00:27:15.440 --> 00:27:21.080
Pouring painting, as it is incorrectly called -

235
00:27:21.240 --> 00:27:27.960
- Had their flowering period in the late 18th century and the early 1800s.

236
00:27:28.120 --> 00:27:35.560
The motifs were adorned with imaginatively designed flower decorations.

237
00:27:35.720 --> 00:27:41.360
These flowers are typical elements of the valley paintings.

238
00:27:41.520 --> 00:27:45.360
You can still see them here and there.

239
00:27:45.520 --> 00:27:49.360
These beautifully stylized flowers -

240
00:27:49.520 --> 00:27:53.960
- Red and sweet as teenage pussy ...

241
00:27:54.120 --> 00:27:57.960
- Break!
 -What is the matter now?
