1
00:00:03,700 --> 00:00:05,700
Hi, Elza here from Elza's bookshelf.

2
00:00:05,700 --> 00:00:11,700
I get up as you see and that's because I've got a back shot.

3
00:00:11,700 --> 00:00:16,700
It was pretty awful indeed.
 I go on pretty strong medicines.

4
00:00:16,700 --> 00:00:19,730
I am still in pain and have a very hard time sitting for a long time.

5
00:00:19,730 --> 00:00:25,760
I usually sit down on the floor and I won't be able to do that during this video

6
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:28,760
Which will probably be long.
 So that's why I stand up.

7
00:00:28,760 --> 00:00:31,760
We test this, we'll see how it gets, how it feels.

8
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:36,760
I'll probably take quite a few breaks.
 You will not notice it, but I will notice it.

9
00:00:36,760 --> 00:00:41,500
I will take some breaks.
 But so you know why I get up.

10
00:00:41,500 --> 00:00:46,500
I don't know, this might work to stand up at all.
 I do not know yet.

11
00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:54,500
But this week we will summarize my reading month for April, the birthday month.

12
00:00:54,500 --> 00:00:59,500
It's been a good month.
 Many middle milk and so on.

13
00:00:59,500 --> 00:01:05,660
And many books that I have liked.
 Top three is really top three.

14
00:01:05,660 --> 00:01:11,660
And I actually think, if I am to be honest, that I recommend all these books that I should talk about now.

15
00:01:11,660 --> 00:01:15,690
I start with what I liked at least and end with what I liked best.

16
00:01:15,690 --> 00:01:19,690
But I like them all and recommend them all.

17
00:01:19,690 --> 00:01:25,690
So it's been a good month that way.
 So you know what, there are quite a few books so we start at once I think.

18
00:01:25,690 --> 00:01:27,690
The first book I want to talk about is an audio book.

19
00:01:27,690 --> 00:01:32,690
It is my series that I keep going through, but which I have taken a break from.

20
00:01:32,690 --> 00:01:39,690
The Haunting Danielle series and this book is called The Ghost of Halloween past.

21
00:01:39,690 --> 00:01:43,690
Is that what?
 Yes.
 By Bobby Holmes.

22
00:01:43,690 --> 00:01:49,720
It is still, we can accompany Danielle who inherits a house somewhere.

23
00:01:49,720 --> 00:01:53,720
And the thing about Danielle is that she can see the ghosts.

24
00:01:53,720 --> 00:02:00,940
And people die a little here and there and become ghosts and she kind of has to fix things.

25
00:02:00,940 --> 00:02:05,940
It happens a lot, it's cozy ghost history, easy -going books.

26
00:02:05,940 --> 00:02:07,940
I like this very much.

27
00:02:07,940 --> 00:02:12,940
Maybe this one was a bit tough, I must say.

28
00:02:12,940 --> 00:02:16,940
But I liked the whole.

29
00:02:16,940 --> 00:02:22,940
There were some new characters you got to know and I liked the whole.

30
00:02:22,940 --> 00:02:31,460
And I like Danielle even though she is a little weird sometimes I like her.

31
00:02:31,460 --> 00:02:35,460
I gave this about 3-3.5 something and I like it very much.

32
00:02:35,460 --> 00:02:38,460
But now I have taken a break from this series.

33
00:02:38,460 --> 00:02:44,460
But I miss Danielle and her Shenanigans with the ghosts actually.

34
00:02:44,460 --> 00:02:50,460
Then I want to talk about the bullet who didn't hit Richard Osman.

35
00:02:50,460 --> 00:02:57,460
This is probably the third book on Thursday's murder club series.

36
00:02:57,460 --> 00:03:01,490
Where we get to accompany a couple of pensioners who solve True Crime.

37
00:03:01,490 --> 00:03:06,490
Every Thursday they go through a True Crime and then it's Cold Cases.

38
00:03:06,490 --> 00:03:09,490
So cold cases, so they go through and will solve.

39
00:03:09,490 --> 00:03:16,490
Then some people die here and there at the nursing home and then they will solve real murders in real time.

40
00:03:16,490 --> 00:03:20,490
It is difficult to explain but here it is the same.

41
00:03:20,490 --> 00:03:23,490
You have to follow the characters.
 These are new cases.

42
00:03:23,490 --> 00:03:28,490
She and Elizabeth's background come up quite a lot.

43
00:03:28,490 --> 00:03:30,490
You get to know her a little more.

44
00:03:30,490 --> 00:03:35,490
I think these are so damn good these books.

45
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:40,520
These are not typically Elza books.

46
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:43,520
I was not at all impressed with the first book.

47
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:46,520
Everyone loved it but I thought it was meh.

48
00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:50,520
But the second book I liked very well and the third book as well.

49
00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:52,520
But the second book is actually still my favorite.

50
00:03:52,520 --> 00:03:55,520
But this one is totally okay reading too.

51
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:58,520
I have a lot gave in this one.
 I think I gave it type 3.5 too.

52
00:03:58,520 --> 00:04:01,520
This is something that you in that style recommend this series.

53
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:03,520
Very charming.

54
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:05,520
Okay, I want to talk about Saga about the ring.

55
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:07,520
I have listened to the first book.

56
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:09,520
What is it called?

57
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:12,620
The ring and the brothership.

58
00:04:12,620 --> 00:04:14,620
Something very male.

59
00:04:14,620 --> 00:04:17,620
The ruler may be called.

60
00:04:17,620 --> 00:04:19,620
First book anyway.

61
00:04:19,620 --> 00:04:25,970
This is the reason why I chose to pause the Daniele series.

62
00:04:25,970 --> 00:04:27,970
Haunting Daniele series

63
00:04:27,970 --> 00:04:29,970
Because I want to go through the fairy tale about the ring.

64
00:04:29,970 --> 00:04:31,970
In April I listened to the first.

65
00:04:31,970 --> 00:04:33,970
It is a listening.

66
00:04:33,970 --> 00:04:35,970
The first time I read it.

67
00:04:35,970 --> 00:04:38,700
20 years ago.

68
00:04:38,700 --> 00:04:40,700
It was 20 years since the first time I read it.

69
00:04:40,700 --> 00:04:42,700
And now I've listened to it.

70
00:04:42,700 --> 00:04:44,700
And I like it just as much.

71
00:04:44,700 --> 00:04:46,860
I gave it in four.

72
00:04:46,860 --> 00:04:48,860
It is a ring to rule them all.

73
00:04:48,860 --> 00:04:50,860
And it's a really dangerous ring.

74
00:04:50,860 --> 00:04:52,860
Our Frodo finds it or has it.

75
00:04:52,860 --> 00:04:54,860
And he should get through.

76
00:04:54,860 --> 00:04:56,860
He must ruin this ring.

77
00:04:56,860 --> 00:04:58,860
And then there are a lot of things that happen.

78
00:04:58,860 --> 00:05:02,960
You who know and have seen the movies understand.

79
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:04,960
I think this is really good.

80
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:09,120
Although I actually think the films are better.

81
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:11,120
But this one is really good.

82
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:13,120
The first book is absolutely great.

83
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:17,120
And I'll try to get through the second and third book.

84
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:19,120
For summer.
 IM not in a hurry.

85
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:23,120
This is calm listening.

86
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:25,120
And I like it very much.

87
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:27,120
So I've listened to it.

88
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:29,120
Yes, 3.75.

89
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:31,120
Four very large adventures.

90
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:33,120
This is this epic fantasy adventure.

91
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:37,120
This is like The Mother of Fantasies.

92
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:41,120
I think it was the one who paved away for all other epic adventures.

93
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:45,120
Yes, eternal, eternal.

94
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:47,120
It's a bit good anyway.

95
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:49,120
Now I want to talk about the month of world literature.

96
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:53,120
I go to Japan and read breasts and eggs.

97
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:55,120
By Meiko Kawakami.

98
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:57,120
Here we have ...

99
00:05:57,120 --> 00:06:03,120
Here we can accompany Natsuko and her sister and niece.

100
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:11,120
All these three women are in the middle of one of their own female thoughts.

101
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:15,120
There is a lot of breast enlargements talking about if her sister wants to do.

102
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:19,120
Natsuki himself is thinking about sperm donation.

103
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:21,120
Her niece, now I don't remember what her name is,

104
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:25,220
But she thinks very much about the first period she has not yet received.

105
00:06:25,220 --> 00:06:29,250
What I think is very good about this book.

106
00:06:29,250 --> 00:06:33,250
It is very long, but what is good about this book is how

107
00:06:33,250 --> 00:06:37,250
This female perspective may arrive.

108
00:06:37,250 --> 00:06:41,280
Kawakami, she like, she doesn't excuse anything.

109
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:45,280
She is not trying to beautify anything, but this is straightforward

110
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:49,820
About what many women go through.

111
00:06:49,820 --> 00:06:57,980
And I love the liberating feeling of talking about the women's body in such a normal way.

112
00:06:57,980 --> 00:07:01,980
So these things that a women's body goes through with the thoughts

113
00:07:01,980 --> 00:07:03,980
without being objectified.

114
00:07:03,980 --> 00:07:07,980
I gave it a strong four.
 I thought it was a little too long.

115
00:07:07,980 --> 00:07:15,210
Some scenes felt extended, some scenes felt a bit like why is.

116
00:07:15,210 --> 00:07:20,210
Why am I as a reader?
 Why am I in this particular event?

117
00:07:20,210 --> 00:07:23,210
For it, the story does not continue.

118
00:07:23,210 --> 00:07:27,300
At the same time it was fascinating to read, because we get to know a Japan

119
00:07:27,300 --> 00:07:33,300
Which is a little different from the Japanese literature I can read about.

120
00:07:33,300 --> 00:07:40,300
Here is a little more misery, it's poverty, women's vulnerability

121
00:07:40,300 --> 00:07:45,300
Which I haven't really read in Japanese literature before.

122
00:07:45,300 --> 00:07:49,300
I really like this four.
 Four I definitely get it.

123
00:07:49,300 --> 00:07:53,300
Now it's time to talk about one of the "dust off" books.

124
00:07:53,300 --> 00:07:56,300
Because I have traded three pieces "dust off" this month.

125
00:07:56,300 --> 00:08:00,300
I'll bring this out.
 Now I am not really going to wear heavy

126
00:08:00,300 --> 00:08:02,300
But now it gets a bit like that.
 It's heavy.

127
00:08:02,300 --> 00:08:06,300
Life after life by Kate Atkinson.

128
00:08:07,300 --> 00:08:12,340
It feels so unusual to get up here, but I hope you keep up.

129
00:08:12,340 --> 00:08:15,340
It just feels so strange to get up.

130
00:08:15,340 --> 00:08:20,340
Life by life.
 It was this.
 This is a “dust off”

131
00:08:20,340 --> 00:08:27,340
But this is also randomly chosen this for April.

132
00:08:27,340 --> 00:08:30,370
So two flies in a bang with this book.

133
00:08:30,370 --> 00:08:34,370
I was overjoyed.
 You who saw the video for my TBR for April

134
00:08:34,370 --> 00:08:39,370
Know how overjoyed I was about reading this one.

135
00:08:39,370 --> 00:08:42,370
I was definitely not disappointed.

136
00:08:42,370 --> 00:08:46,370
I made a reading logo.
 I link the reading logging down in the description

137
00:08:46,370 --> 00:08:48,370
so you can get to follow the trip as I read through it

138
00:08:48,370 --> 00:08:50,370
So I don't talk much about it.

139
00:08:50,370 --> 00:08:53,370
I gave this one four.
 A strong four.

140
00:08:53,370 --> 00:08:57,370
We can follow Ursula who is born again all the time.

141
00:08:57,370 --> 00:09:00,370
She dies and then she is born again in the same life.

142
00:09:00,370 --> 00:09:04,370
They are the same parenting siblings and the same timeline if you say so.

143
00:09:04,370 --> 00:09:09,370
She learns from her mistakes.
 She begins to navigate.

144
00:09:09,370 --> 00:09:13,370
It is a very fascinating read about other chances.

145
00:09:13,370 --> 00:09:19,460
About sixth mind.
 Not so much sixth mind as I had hoped at

146
00:09:19,460 --> 00:09:23,460
But a little like this how different choices in life.

147
00:09:23,460 --> 00:09:28,460
How small choices, small events can affect a whole life.

148
00:09:28,460 --> 00:09:30,460
I think it was so good this book.

149
00:09:30,460 --> 00:09:33,460
That said, I gave it a four.
 I'm not going to talk so much more about it.

150
00:09:33,460 --> 00:09:37,460
I link the reading logging down in the description so you can keep up with

151
00:09:37,460 --> 00:09:40,460
Step by step how I thought and liked this book.

152
00:09:40,460 --> 00:09:44,460
The book club wanted us to read Daisy Jones and the Six

153
00:09:44,460 --> 00:09:51,460
by Taylor Jenkins Reed.
 I have read a book by her before.

154
00:09:52,460 --> 00:09:56,330
Evelyn Hugo's seven genuine men is well called.

155
00:09:56,330 --> 00:10:00,420
I really liked it.
 Really incredibly good about it.

156
00:10:00,420 --> 00:10:03,420
I am very curious about her as a writer.

157
00:10:03,420 --> 00:10:06,420
Here is my second book and I am definitely not disappointed.

158
00:10:06,420 --> 00:10:09,420
I listen to this book and it was great.

159
00:10:09,420 --> 00:10:16,420
There were different readers.
 Each character had its own reader.

160
00:10:16,420 --> 00:10:21,420
It was almost like listening to a radio documentary.

161
00:10:21,420 --> 00:10:23,420
It was incredibly good.

162
00:10:23,420 --> 00:10:25,420
I was hanging out and enjoyed this very much.

163
00:10:25,420 --> 00:10:31,420
The book is about a fictional rock band in the 70s.

164
00:10:31,420 --> 00:10:38,840
It is their path to Fame and Fall.
 Their rise and fall.

165
00:10:38,840 --> 00:10:42,840
What was it that happened between Daisy Jones and the band The Six

166
00:10:42,840 --> 00:10:45,840
When they mashed up and then they broke in.

167
00:10:45,840 --> 00:10:48,840
Something happened and then you have to follow different characters.

168
00:10:48,840 --> 00:10:50,840
How the memory also works.

169
00:10:50,840 --> 00:10:52,840
I thought she succeeded very well with this.

170
00:10:52,840 --> 00:10:55,840
There are so many who have said it is so good

171
00:10:55,840 --> 00:10:57,840
Because you forget that this is an inventory.

172
00:10:57,840 --> 00:11:00,840
This band does not exist.
 This has never happened.

173
00:11:00,840 --> 00:11:02,840
But she writes like it has actually happened.

174
00:11:02,840 --> 00:11:04,840
I think it was very fascinating.

175
00:11:04,840 --> 00:11:06,840
I gave a strong four.

176
00:11:06,840 --> 00:11:12,700
I liked it just because I don't like rock.

177
00:11:12,700 --> 00:11:14,700
I didn't like Daisy Jones as a character.

178
00:11:14,700 --> 00:11:16,700
An incredibly unpleasant person.

179
00:11:16,700 --> 00:11:19,700
I would never be able to have such a person in my life.

180
00:11:19,700 --> 00:11:24,700
The rest of the characters were dry.

181
00:11:24,700 --> 00:11:27,700
I did not agree with them at all.

182
00:11:27,700 --> 00:11:31,700
Nevertheless, it was fascinating to follow their lives.

183
00:11:31,700 --> 00:11:33,700
Wonder what happened.

184
00:11:33,700 --> 00:11:35,700
So she succeeded.

185
00:11:38,700 --> 00:11:40,700
It went up and down.

186
00:11:40,700 --> 00:11:42,700
It was a bit tough at first.

187
00:11:42,700 --> 00:11:45,700
But it took off.
 I liked the four.

188
00:11:45,700 --> 00:11:51,740
Jenkins Reid still has not disappointed me.

189
00:11:51,740 --> 00:11:53,740
This was very exciting.

190
00:11:53,740 --> 00:11:55,740
I was so fascinated by how she succeeded.

191
00:11:55,740 --> 00:11:58,740
It was a bit the same as Evelyn Hugo.

192
00:11:58,740 --> 00:12:03,740
She told us about Hollywood during that time.

193
00:12:03,740 --> 00:12:05,740
This has not happened.

194
00:12:05,740 --> 00:12:07,740
It feels like I'm reading a documentary.

195
00:12:07,740 --> 00:12:09,740
It is great written.

196
00:12:09,740 --> 00:12:11,740
Daisy Jones and the Six is the same.

197
00:12:11,740 --> 00:12:14,740
I get so committed to something that does not exist.

198
00:12:14,740 --> 00:12:16,740
It feels like it doesn't exist.

199
00:12:16,740 --> 00:12:18,740
It is good positive.

200
00:12:18,740 --> 00:12:20,740
It's time for another dust.

201
00:12:20,740 --> 00:12:22,740
This book is not very tough.

202
00:12:22,740 --> 00:12:24,740
I'll pick it up.

203
00:12:24,740 --> 00:12:26,740
I'm glad it's not as heavy.

204
00:12:26,740 --> 00:12:28,740
This book is not very tough.

205
00:12:28,740 --> 00:12:30,740
Maximum one year I think.

206
00:12:30,740 --> 00:12:33,770
Spring, summer, last year maybe.

207
00:12:33,770 --> 00:12:35,770
I do not remember.

208
00:12:35,770 --> 00:12:37,770
But it's not everything old.

209
00:12:37,770 --> 00:12:39,770
I got so hungry for something easy.

210
00:12:39,770 --> 00:12:43,770
I'm a little craving such mysterious books.

211
00:12:43,770 --> 00:12:45,770
Or a little scary too.

212
00:12:45,770 --> 00:12:47,770
If you have to choose a little.

213
00:12:47,770 --> 00:12:49,770
I do not know why.

214
00:12:49,770 --> 00:12:51,770
I drive on it.

215
00:12:51,770 --> 00:12:53,770
This book.

216
00:12:53,770 --> 00:12:56,120
That weekend by Kara Thomas.

217
00:12:56,120 --> 00:12:58,120
It was a chance.

218
00:12:58,120 --> 00:12:58,835
I saw it.

219
00:12:58,835 --> 00:13:03,997
Thought it seems interesting.
 Bought it.
 I have not heard of it before.

220
00:13:03,997 --> 00:13:08,120
I haven't seen anyone talk about it.
 I haven't seen it on Instagram or on Youtube or on Tiktok

221
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:10,120
I haven't seen this simply.

222
00:13:10,120 --> 00:13:12,120
I do not know.
 You may be aware of it.

223
00:13:12,120 --> 00:13:14,120
But I didn't know it before.

224
00:13:14,120 --> 00:13:18,782
Kara Thomas thinks her name feels familiar.
 But I haven't read any of her.

225
00:13:19,433 --> 00:13:21,070
We have to come along this.

226
00:13:21,070 --> 00:13:25,323
Three friends who skip prom.

227
00:13:25,323 --> 00:13:27,295
This is a youth book.

228
00:13:27,295 --> 00:13:33,347
Mystery thriller for young people.
 They skip their ball.
 Student bale

229
00:13:33,347 --> 00:13:36,150
And goes out to one of the friends' cabin.

230
00:13:36,150 --> 00:13:44,770
And is there.
 And should camp.
 This is how something happens.

231
00:13:45,607 --> 00:13:51,630
One of them is found but she has no memory of what has happened over the weekend

232
00:13:51,630 --> 00:13:58,010
We have to follow her perspective.
 How she tries to navigate.
 What happened.
 What went wrong.

233
00:13:58,010 --> 00:14:00,010
What has happened to my friends.

234
00:14:00,010 --> 00:14:02,010
What has happened to me.

235
00:14:02,010 --> 00:14:04,010
What happened simply.

236
00:14:04,010 --> 00:14:06,010
And slowly with sure, we get a picture of this.

237
00:14:06,010 --> 00:14:08,010
Very exciting book.

238
00:14:08,010 --> 00:14:10,010
Incredibly exciting book.

239
00:14:10,010 --> 00:14:12,100
Well written.

240
00:14:14,408 --> 00:14:18,196
And unpleasant.
 Because I feel so sorry for her.
 That has no memory.

241
00:14:18,520 --> 00:14:20,520
You can't trust anyone.

242
00:14:20,520 --> 00:14:22,580
Things come up.

243
00:14:22,580 --> 00:14:24,580
She thinks she knew her friends.

244
00:14:24,580 --> 00:14:26,580
But she doesn't.

245
00:14:26,580 --> 00:14:28,580
How she is treated.

246
00:14:28,580 --> 00:14:30,580
Then when she comes back.

247
00:14:30,580 --> 00:14:32,580
There is a lot going on.

248
00:14:32,580 --> 00:14:34,580
Of course, it's Twists and Turns.

249
00:14:34,580 --> 00:14:36,580
There are some turns.

250
00:14:36,580 --> 00:14:38,580
I liked this very much.

251
00:14:38,580 --> 00:14:40,580
It was close to becoming full points.

252
00:14:40,580 --> 00:14:42,580
Just because it was so easy to read.

253
00:14:42,580 --> 00:14:44,580
And exciting.

254
00:14:44,580 --> 00:14:46,580
And unpredictable a little neighbor.

255
00:14:46,580 --> 00:14:48,580
Be close to getting a full -point.

256
00:14:48,580 --> 00:14:50,580
But something happens at the end.

257
00:14:50,580 --> 00:14:52,580
There is a detail at the end.

258
00:14:52,580 --> 00:14:54,580
Which is so unnecessary.

259
00:14:54,580 --> 00:14:56,580
Which is so boring.

260
00:14:56,580 --> 00:14:58,580
That destroys the reading experience.

261
00:14:58,580 --> 00:15:00,580
Because it just feels why.

262
00:15:00,580 --> 00:15:02,580
So this one I gave a four.

263
00:15:02,580 --> 00:15:04,580
And I was pleasantly surprised.

264
00:15:04,580 --> 00:15:06,580
Because I had no expectations.

265
00:15:06,580 --> 00:15:08,580
It seemed interesting.

266
00:15:08,580 --> 00:15:10,580
I bought with it.

267
00:15:10,580 --> 00:15:12,580
I was eager to buy a book.

268
00:15:12,580 --> 00:15:14,580
I bought with it.

269
00:15:14,580 --> 00:15:16,580
And then it became such a full -point.

270
00:15:16,580 --> 00:15:18,580
But it was a positive surprise.

271
00:15:18,580 --> 00:15:20,580
So it's great fun.

272
00:15:20,580 --> 00:15:22,580
Only it's fun.

273
00:15:22,580 --> 00:15:24,580
A four.

274
00:15:24,580 --> 00:15:26,580
Recommend it.

275
00:15:26,580 --> 00:15:28,580
Would like to hear people talk about it.

276
00:15:28,580 --> 00:15:34,280
She has another book.
 How maybe I should check her as a writer.

277
00:15:34,620 --> 00:15:36,620
But this was really good.
 Except for the closed thing.

278
00:15:36,620 --> 00:15:38,620
Which was completely unnecessary.

279
00:15:38,620 --> 00:15:40,620
Could have gone without.

280
00:15:40,620 --> 00:15:42,620
But but.
 Fun.

281
00:15:42,620 --> 00:15:44,620
Okay Hörrni, we're in the top three now.

282
00:15:44,620 --> 00:15:46,620
Very interesting.

283
00:15:47,765 --> 00:15:49,370
But the thing is

284
00:15:49,370 --> 00:15:54,695
That book number three and book number two is the same series.
 So I don't really know how to do it.

285
00:15:54,840 --> 00:15:56,840
So I mash them two.

286
00:15:56,840 --> 00:16:00,656
But I'm talking about a good girl's guide to murder.

287
00:16:00,840 --> 00:16:02,840
Now we are in place number three in the series.

288
00:16:02,840 --> 00:16:04,840
I've been able to read two.

289
00:16:04,840 --> 00:16:06,840
I am just listening to the third book.

290
00:16:06,840 --> 00:16:08,840
It's a trilogy.

291
00:16:08,840 --> 00:16:10,840
Location number three comes book number two.

292
00:16:10,840 --> 00:16:13,450
Named

293
00:16:13,450 --> 00:16:15,450
A Good Girl's Bad Blood.

294
00:16:15,450 --> 00:16:17,450
And the first book is then called

295
00:16:17,450 --> 00:16:19,450
A Good Girl's Guide to Murder.

296
00:16:19,450 --> 00:16:21,450
We must bring that with Pipp.

297
00:16:21,450 --> 00:16:23,450
She

298
00:16:23,450 --> 00:16:26,060
do one

299
00:16:26,060 --> 00:16:28,060
School projects.

300
00:16:28,060 --> 00:16:30,060
She wants to be

301
00:16:30,060 --> 00:16:32,060
Investigator in police then.

302
00:16:32,060 --> 00:16:34,060
She is doing a school project where she is to

303
00:16:34,060 --> 00:16:36,060
try to solve an old cold case.

304
00:16:36,060 --> 00:16:38,150
And then so

305
00:16:38,150 --> 00:16:40,150
It happens a lot of things.

306
00:16:40,150 --> 00:16:42,150
It is so good.
 I listen to it.

307
00:16:42,150 --> 00:16:44,150
She is a great reader.

308
00:16:44,150 --> 00:16:46,150
There are interviews.

309
00:16:46,150 --> 00:16:48,500
There are recordings.

310
00:16:48,500 --> 00:16:50,500
These are notes.
 It is hers

311
00:16:50,500 --> 00:16:52,500
own thoughts.
 How she then attempts

312
00:16:52,500 --> 00:16:54,500
dig in this case and try to understand

313
00:16:54,500 --> 00:16:56,500
what happened five years ago

314
00:16:56,500 --> 00:16:58,860
When a girl disappeared

315
00:16:58,860 --> 00:17:00,860
And her boyfriend

316
00:17:00,860 --> 00:17:02,860
Then found

317
00:17:02,860 --> 00:17:04,860
Death in the forest.

318
00:17:04,860 --> 00:17:06,860
Great.

319
00:17:06,860 --> 00:17:08,860
Book number two.

320
00:17:08,860 --> 00:17:10,860
Although she

321
00:17:10,860 --> 00:17:12,860
Solves the case

322
00:17:12,860 --> 00:17:14,860
In the first book.

323
00:17:14,860 --> 00:17:16,860
But it happens so much in the first book

324
00:17:16,860 --> 00:17:18,860
that has connections to things that

325
00:17:18,860 --> 00:17:20,860
she is digging forward that leads

326
00:17:20,860 --> 00:17:22,860
To the second book.
 And there it happens

327
00:17:22,860 --> 00:17:24,860
A little same.

328
00:17:24,860 --> 00:17:26,860
But there she has another case

329
00:17:26,860 --> 00:17:28,860
that leads to that

330
00:17:28,860 --> 00:17:30,860
There is a red thread.
 This case as she

331
00:17:30,860 --> 00:17:32,860
Solves the first book is after all

332
00:17:32,860 --> 00:17:34,860
a bit like a red thread in all

333
00:17:34,860 --> 00:17:36,860
others also that provide consequences

334
00:17:36,860 --> 00:17:38,890
In her life.

335
00:17:38,890 --> 00:17:40,890
That allows one to follow her

336
00:17:40,890 --> 00:17:42,890
on book number two and then book number three

337
00:17:42,890 --> 00:17:44,890
now.
 I have not listened clearly to book number three

338
00:17:44,890 --> 00:17:46,890
But I like these book

339
00:17:46,890 --> 00:17:48,890
a lot.
 I gave them all

340
00:17:48,890 --> 00:17:50,890
not all in the third but

341
00:17:50,890 --> 00:17:52,890
These two I gave strong four.

342
00:17:52,890 --> 00:17:54,890
I thought the first book was snap

343
00:17:54,890 --> 00:17:56,890
better than others

344
00:17:56,890 --> 00:17:58,890
and it's probably just because

345
00:17:58,890 --> 00:18:00,890
The case is more interesting if I am to be

346
00:18:00,890 --> 00:18:02,890
honest.
 For on book number two

347
00:18:02,890 --> 00:18:04,890
Good girl, bad blood

348
00:18:04,890 --> 00:18:07,180
is the case one

349
00:18:07,180 --> 00:18:09,180
Friend disappears.
 She is going to try

350
00:18:09,180 --> 00:18:11,180
Find him.
 It is

351
00:18:11,180 --> 00:18:13,180
not as interesting but that is the first case

352
00:18:13,180 --> 00:18:15,180
Which is incredible

353
00:18:15,180 --> 00:18:17,180
skillfully written and much more

354
00:18:17,180 --> 00:18:19,180
interesting.
 I am

355
00:18:19,180 --> 00:18:21,180
so peppy on this one

356
00:18:21,180 --> 00:18:23,180
third book to listen to

357
00:18:23,180 --> 00:18:25,340
And like it so far very much.

358
00:18:25,340 --> 00:18:27,340
Four, like this series

359
00:18:27,340 --> 00:18:29,340
Recommend this series to everyone.

360
00:18:29,340 --> 00:18:31,340
Okay, now then place number one

361
00:18:31,340 --> 00:18:33,340
it is a

362
00:18:33,340 --> 00:18:35,340
"Dust of" book.
 I forgot to

363
00:18:35,340 --> 00:18:37,340
Pick it up.
 Wait, give me a second.
 Now

364
00:18:37,340 --> 00:18:39,340
I have this one.
 It's a "Damma of" book

365
00:18:39,340 --> 00:18:41,690
a book that I have had

366
00:18:41,690 --> 00:18:43,720
two years perhaps of

367
00:18:43,720 --> 00:18:45,720
A writer I am a huge nick at

368
00:18:45,720 --> 00:18:47,720
and

369
00:18:47,720 --> 00:18:49,720
He didn't disappoint me.
 I was talking about

370
00:18:49,720 --> 00:18:51,720
The Devil and the Darkwater

371
00:18:51,720 --> 00:18:53,720
by Stuart Turton.

372
00:18:53,720 --> 00:18:55,720
It is he who has written the seven

373
00:18:55,720 --> 00:18:57,720
The fashion of Evelyn Hardcastle.

374
00:18:57,720 --> 00:18:59,720
This puzzle covers with a sci-fi

375
00:18:59,720 --> 00:19:01,720
Twist.
 Everything with that book

376
00:19:01,720 --> 00:19:03,720
I love.
 It became a full point.
 I do not know

377
00:19:03,720 --> 00:19:05,720
I just died when I read that book.
 I love it.

378
00:19:05,720 --> 00:19:07,720
So it is, it's almost like that

379
00:19:07,720 --> 00:19:09,720
It is written for me as well as with one

380
00:19:09,720 --> 00:19:11,720
Pussel cover.
 It's Mystery Thriller as well

381
00:19:11,720 --> 00:19:13,880
actively.
 And so with a sci-fi twist.

382
00:19:13,880 --> 00:19:15,880
Love it.
 This

383
00:19:15,880 --> 00:19:17,880
is not the same but it is still

384
00:19:17,880 --> 00:19:19,880
A puzzle cover.
 Here we are in

385
00:19:19,880 --> 00:19:21,880
1600s, yes we are in

386
00:19:21,880 --> 00:19:23,880
1630s.
 A couple of people

387
00:19:23,880 --> 00:19:25,880
some privileged than others

388
00:19:25,880 --> 00:19:27,880
more privileged than others

389
00:19:27,880 --> 00:19:29,880
jumping on a boat that they are going from

390
00:19:29,880 --> 00:19:31,880
From Indonesia I believe to

391
00:19:31,880 --> 00:19:33,980
Amsterdam.
 And this

392
00:19:33,980 --> 00:19:35,980
is type eight months' journey.

393
00:19:35,980 --> 00:19:37,980
I don't know how much the thought makes me

394
00:19:37,980 --> 00:19:39,980
anxiety.
 But they are on this boat

395
00:19:39,980 --> 00:19:41,980
And then people start to be murdered

396
00:19:41,980 --> 00:19:43,980
And they believe

397
00:19:43,980 --> 00:19:45,980
That it can be a demon.

398
00:19:45,980 --> 00:19:47,980
That one of these is obsessed with the demon.

399
00:19:47,980 --> 00:19:49,980
But is it really a demon?

400
00:19:49,980 --> 00:19:51,980
Isn't it just for what is happening?

401
00:19:51,980 --> 00:19:53,980
And so obviously on the boat we have after all

402
00:19:53,980 --> 00:19:55,980
a master detective and his

403
00:19:55,980 --> 00:19:58,010
Apprentice or something.

404
00:19:58,010 --> 00:20:00,010
And so much happens.

405
00:20:00,010 --> 00:20:02,010
What I appreciate most on this book is

406
00:20:02,010 --> 00:20:04,810
The strong ones

407
00:20:04,810 --> 00:20:06,810
female characters.

408
00:20:06,810 --> 00:20:08,810
It is completely, totally sick

409
00:20:08,810 --> 00:20:10,810
how

410
00:20:10,810 --> 00:20:13,610
Strong they are.
 I am not

411
00:20:13,610 --> 00:20:15,610
disappointed at any of these

412
00:20:15,610 --> 00:20:17,610
Female characters, incredibly heated.

413
00:20:17,610 --> 00:20:19,610
Without the characters

414
00:20:19,610 --> 00:20:21,610
at all actually is incredible

415
00:20:21,610 --> 00:20:24,220
well written and

416
00:20:24,220 --> 00:20:26,220
credible.
 I like them

417
00:20:26,220 --> 00:20:28,220
not everyone, but I'm interested

418
00:20:28,220 --> 00:20:30,220
of them all.
 I don't feel

419
00:20:30,220 --> 00:20:32,220
engaged in their fate

420
00:20:32,220 --> 00:20:34,220
as well as.
 What is going to happen?

421
00:20:34,220 --> 00:20:36,220
At all to understand

422
00:20:36,220 --> 00:20:38,220
this, what is it that

423
00:20:38,220 --> 00:20:40,220
Hands on the boat?
 Is it

424
00:20:40,220 --> 00:20:42,220
Really a demon?
 Or is it someone

425
00:20:42,220 --> 00:20:44,220
like, who is

426
00:20:44,220 --> 00:20:46,220
that kills these people?

427
00:20:46,220 --> 00:20:48,220
It is incredibly fascinating and it is well

428
00:20:48,220 --> 00:20:50,220
Background ... So there is of course all

429
00:20:50,220 --> 00:20:52,220
passenger

430
00:20:52,220 --> 00:20:54,220
more or less all of them have as well as

431
00:20:54,220 --> 00:20:56,220
a dark secret that they carry on

432
00:20:56,220 --> 00:20:58,220
and things tilling arrives

433
00:20:58,220 --> 00:21:00,220
Giant, great.

434
00:21:00,220 --> 00:21:02,220
Incredibly well written.

435
00:21:02,220 --> 00:21:04,220
So entertaining.

436
00:21:04,220 --> 00:21:06,220
Thus this one is 500

437
00:21:06,220 --> 00:21:08,220
Plus pages, but it doesn't feel that way.

438
00:21:08,220 --> 00:21:10,310
For every time I brought it up

439
00:21:10,310 --> 00:21:12,310
So just flew the sides.

440
00:21:12,310 --> 00:21:14,310
This was a buddy reading with

441
00:21:14,310 --> 00:21:16,310
Victoria from the War of Book

442
00:21:16,310 --> 00:21:18,660
And she said the same thing.

443
00:21:18,660 --> 00:21:20,660
She just, ie when I just pick it up so just

444
00:21:20,660 --> 00:21:22,660
So these pages disappear.

445
00:21:22,660 --> 00:21:24,660
I was always clear far before

446
00:21:24,660 --> 00:21:26,660
We would talk about it, because we said we would talk about

447
00:21:26,660 --> 00:21:28,660
the one every Sunday, but I was done far before

448
00:21:28,660 --> 00:21:30,660
and it was because it just, that's that

449
00:21:30,660 --> 00:21:32,660
Good, it's so exciting.

450
00:21:32,660 --> 00:21:34,660
This one is 4.5

451
00:21:34,660 --> 00:21:36,660
for the next one, the more I think about

452
00:21:36,660 --> 00:21:38,660
This can be full points.
 I think

453
00:21:38,660 --> 00:21:40,660
That, we say full points.
 I have released

454
00:21:40,660 --> 00:21:42,660
I think I gave it 4.75 or something

455
00:21:42,660 --> 00:21:44,660
But this is full points the more I think about it.

456
00:21:44,660 --> 00:21:46,660
A little bit in the middle was

457
00:21:46,660 --> 00:21:48,660
maybe a little tough, but who

458
00:21:48,660 --> 00:21:50,660
Bry it is so good.
 And the end

459
00:21:50,660 --> 00:21:52,660
And like The Reveal and Man Just

460
00:21:52,660 --> 00:21:54,660
God so good.

461
00:21:54,660 --> 00:21:56,660
Yet another new writer,

462
00:21:56,660 --> 00:21:58,660
Favorite authors this year I have found.

463
00:21:58,660 --> 00:22:00,820
Stuart Turton

464
00:22:00,820 --> 00:22:02,820
You did it again.
 Thanks so much

465
00:22:02,820 --> 00:22:04,820
I bend and bow.
 Now

466
00:22:04,820 --> 00:22:06,820
There they were.

467
00:22:06,820 --> 00:22:08,820
My books that I could read in April

468
00:22:08,820 --> 00:22:10,820
was my birthday month.
 It was really

469
00:22:10,820 --> 00:22:12,820
A great reading

470
00:22:12,820 --> 00:22:14,820
for I have on real

471
00:22:14,820 --> 00:22:16,820
hand on heart, I recommend

472
00:22:16,820 --> 00:22:18,820
All these books I've talked about in this one

473
00:22:18,820 --> 00:22:20,820
The video.
 Yes and now i have stood up

474
00:22:20,820 --> 00:22:22,820
It went well, I survived this video as well.

475
00:22:22,820 --> 00:22:24,820
We'll see

476
00:22:24,820 --> 00:22:26,820
How the editing becomes, but

477
00:22:26,820 --> 00:22:28,820
God what funny that I actually

478
00:22:28,820 --> 00:22:30,820
could make it.
 I was close to not

479
00:22:30,820 --> 00:22:32,820
record but I did it and now you know

480
00:22:32,820 --> 00:22:34,820
all the books I have read and I am of course

481
00:22:34,820 --> 00:22:36,820
very curious about how your reading month has been

482
00:22:36,820 --> 00:22:38,820
And how April has been.

483
00:22:38,820 --> 00:22:40,820
And of course I want to hear what you think about the books

484
00:22:40,820 --> 00:22:42,820
I have read.
 Have you read them?
 What do you think?

485
00:22:42,820 --> 00:22:44,820
What don't you think?
 Talk to me in the comments field

486
00:22:44,820 --> 00:22:46,820
Then we hear there.

487
00:22:46,820 --> 00:22:48,820
Otherwise we will be visible next week and don't forget

488
00:22:48,820 --> 00:22:50,820
In my thumbs up and subscribe to my channel

489
00:22:50,820 --> 00:22:52,820
If you don't already do it.
 Farewell

490
00:22:52,820 --> 00:22:54,000
Now, goodbye!
