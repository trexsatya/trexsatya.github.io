1
00:00:00,079 --> 00:00:02,873
Is it that you have saved SEK 10,000 together?

2
00:00:02,921 --> 00:00:06,249
You may be thinking about: What should you do with the money?

3
00:00:06,302 --> 00:00:09,518
You can't have them in a bank account at your regular bank!

4
00:00:09,566 --> 00:00:11,981
What do they give?
 Type 0 in interest.

5
00:00:12,046 --> 00:00:13,966
Then this video is perfect for you!

6
00:00:14,014 --> 00:00:18,609
I intend to show you how I think, if I had invested SEK 10,000 just today.

7
00:00:18,689 --> 00:00:23,012
If you do not know who I am, my name is Marcus Lindblad and I run Sparecash.

8
00:00:23,069 --> 00:00:26,735
Sparecash.se I have started, as well as this Youtube channel,

9
00:00:26,775 --> 00:00:32,663
With the goal of learning you who are beginners how to invest in shares, funds and much more.

10
00:00:32,717 --> 00:00:35,768
But keep in mind that investment comes with a very high risk.

11
00:00:35,844 --> 00:00:41,737
This means that when you invest your money you can lose parts of, or whole, your capital.

12
00:00:41,848 --> 00:00:44,205
So be careful when investing your money.

13
00:00:44,352 --> 00:00:48,352
- subtitles of talk - - www.prata.ltd -

14
00:00:48,500 --> 00:00:51,752
The absolute first I had done with these SEK 10,000

15
00:00:51,831 --> 00:00:54,780
is that I had divided them into four smaller pieces.

16
00:00:54,852 --> 00:00:58,482
The first one will then be SEK 2,500.

17
00:00:58,610 --> 00:01:03,151
What do I do with them?
 Well, the first thing I had chosen is a global fund.

18
00:01:03,229 --> 00:01:07,472
With a global fund you get a very wide spread all over the world

19
00:01:07,568 --> 00:01:10,802
And the absolute largest companies in the world.

20
00:01:10,901 --> 00:01:14,309
If you look at global funds today you get exposure to, among other things:

21
00:01:14,373 --> 00:01:19,932
Apple, Google, Microsoft and Large, American, Stable Companies

22
00:01:19,983 --> 00:01:24,056
Which has made a lot of money and will do so for many years to come.

23
00:01:24,097 --> 00:01:30,731
If the world economy goes well, the funds will also go up and your money will grow.

24
00:01:30,824 --> 00:01:34,264
But which global fund should you choose then, maybe you are thinking about.

25
00:01:34,384 --> 00:01:40,462
Well, I had chosen Länsförsäkringar Global Index -close or Avanza Global.

26
00:01:40,530 --> 00:01:43,030
Two perfect global funds.

27
00:01:43,094 --> 00:01:48,784
There is not much difference between these two so it does not matter which one you actually choose.

28
00:01:52,686 --> 00:02:00,337
So, now we have invested SEK 2,500 in a fund, and now I want us to take the step and actually buy a share.

29
00:02:00,384 --> 00:02:04,444
So we thump SEK 2,500 in Investor.
 Boom!

30
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:10,729
Investor is an investment company, which means that they in turn own other companies.

31
00:02:10,780 --> 00:02:17,663
These companies are stable, safe, Swedish companies that do well with profits and also distribute the profits,

32
00:02:17,735 --> 00:02:23,593
Which means that we as a shareholder get some pure cash into the account by owning these shares.

33
00:02:23,687 --> 00:02:29,915
Investor is a perfect beginner's share that has also beaten the stock exchange, historically.

34
00:02:29,979 --> 00:02:32,158
But what do you get if you buy Investor?

35
00:02:32,222 --> 00:02:37,009
Yes: Atlas Copco, ABB, EQT and many others.

36
00:02:40,850 --> 00:02:44,650
The third investment.
 2,500 SEK we will now add.

37
00:02:44,769 --> 00:02:47,697
There I want to strike a blow for a fund robot.

38
00:02:47,769 --> 00:02:52,172
A fund robot is managing the investments for you.

39
00:02:52,260 --> 00:02:54,454
Do you need a fund robot?
 No.

40
00:02:54,542 --> 00:02:58,964
You absolutely do not need to invest in a fund robot if you do not want to.

41
00:02:59,020 --> 00:03:03,820
But I think it's nice to have a fund robot.
 A bit like a airbag.

42
00:03:03,864 --> 00:03:07,562
If one's self has some trouble dealing with the emotions

43
00:03:07,618 --> 00:03:13,265
And may not know what to invest in, so a fund robot is perfect for you who are a beginner.

44
00:03:13,337 --> 00:03:16,390
With a fund robot you usually get a very wide spread

45
00:03:16,469 --> 00:03:21,175
Among a variety of funds and ETFs at a reasonably low fee.

46
00:03:21,267 --> 00:03:28,759
If you do not want to choose a fund robot, you can instead double the sum that you put in a global fund.

47
00:03:28,829 --> 00:03:32,415
It is just as good with a global fund as with a fund robot.

48
00:03:32,535 --> 00:03:37,906
If you are eager to invest in a fund robot then I have made a comparison between Lysa and Opti

49
00:03:37,939 --> 00:03:42,297
which are two of the larger fund robots in Sweden, which you probably know.

50
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:44,283
My favorite is shine.

51
00:03:44,347 --> 00:03:51,752
Lysa is the cheapest fund robot and the fee is very important to look at if you compare different fund robots.

52
00:03:51,838 --> 00:03:56,575
My strategy, when I invest in a fund robot, is to always have 100% shares.

53
00:03:56,639 --> 00:04:02,592
It is true that when you choose a fund robot you have to answer a few different questions.

54
00:04:02,632 --> 00:04:08,532
These questions will give you a suggestion for various investments that you will choose.

55
00:04:08,590 --> 00:04:16,076
The fund robot will thus give you a proposal for distribution between shares and interest rates in your investments.

56
00:04:16,140 --> 00:04:22,443
My philosophy as an investor is to always have 100% shares among my investments.

57
00:04:22,555 --> 00:04:26,717
Because the interest rate is quite low now, around the world but also in Sweden,

58
00:04:26,757 --> 00:04:31,020
So you don't get that much for the money when you invest in interest rates.

59
00:04:31,099 --> 00:04:36,445
Therefore, I prefer shares instead, in the long run, if you are a long -term investor.

60
00:04:36,500 --> 00:04:41,786
If you want a little more stability and that your money doesn't turn so much ...

61
00:04:41,866 --> 00:04:44,465
If you were to invest in shares then it goes like this

62
00:04:44,529 --> 00:04:50,323
But if you invest in a mixture of shares and interest rates, you will receive a more stable return.

63
00:04:50,395 --> 00:04:54,427
So for those who may need the money within a slightly shorter time,

64
00:04:54,475 --> 00:04:56,769
If you need them within 3-5 years,

65
00:04:56,849 --> 00:05:00,432
Maybe it's a good idea to have some interest rates in your portfolio.

66
00:05:00,544 --> 00:05:03,010
But I'm not an advocate of it.

67
00:05:03,093 --> 00:05:08,025
If you want to read more about fund robots, I have a comparison on SpareCash that you can check out there.

68
00:05:11,995 --> 00:05:15,960
The fourth and final investment.
 We have SEK 2,500.

69
00:05:16,048 --> 00:05:18,823
Here I want to fit over the ball to you.

70
00:05:18,879 --> 00:05:23,144
I want you to read on.
 Think about what you are interested in investing in.

71
00:05:23,193 --> 00:05:27,417
Is it that you want to choose a share or a special fund?
 Think!

72
00:05:27,570 --> 00:05:30,974
In any case, I had chosen another fund.

73
00:05:31,125 --> 00:05:37,298
I usually advise beginners to aim to have 80% funds and 20% shares.

74
00:05:37,384 --> 00:05:42,822
In my case, I choose a fund that I believe in.
 Then I choose a small company fund.

75
00:05:42,941 --> 00:05:49,738
But you can choose some other type of fund.
 For example, an Asia Fund, a emerging market fund,

76
00:05:49,855 --> 00:05:53,080
Or a particular country you think will go well in the long run.

77
00:05:53,176 --> 00:05:58,237
Or another fund, such as technology, sustainable energy or similar.

78
00:05:58,293 --> 00:06:03,917
Think about what you believe in, which you like to follow and read about.

79
00:06:04,008 --> 00:06:09,498
I choose a small company fund because small companies have actually gone very well over time.

80
00:06:09,598 --> 00:06:12,996
Small companies have tended to go better than the stock exchange in the long run.

81
00:06:13,068 --> 00:06:16,686
Because if you find these little companies at an early stage

82
00:06:16,730 --> 00:06:19,572
So you have to participate in a very nice trip in the long run,

83
00:06:19,613 --> 00:06:24,046
If they are increasing, make more money and grow in the long run.

84
00:06:24,126 --> 00:06:26,243
Then you can make a really nice trip.

85
00:06:26,283 --> 00:06:28,840
But, as I said, I want to fit the ball to you.

86
00:06:28,889 --> 00:06:32,015
Think about what you wanted to have in your portfolio.

87
00:06:36,227 --> 00:06:38,964
When investing in shares and funds,

88
00:06:39,028 --> 00:06:44,219
Then make sure you do it in an ISK account or in a capital insurance.

89
00:06:44,307 --> 00:06:48,695
It gives you a low treasure and you don't have to declare your business.

90
00:06:48,759 --> 00:06:54,481
If you have them in a stock and fund account then you will instead pay 30% tax on your profit

91
00:06:54,548 --> 00:06:59,797
And you will need to report your business to the Swedish Tax Agency in your next declaration.

92
00:06:59,847 --> 00:07:01,768
And it can be a bit boring!

93
00:07:01,985 --> 00:07:05,778
Do you have any thoughts about these investments I have talked about,

94
00:07:05,858 --> 00:07:07,452

If you are even more tagged and curious about how I do with my investments,

101
00:07:33,525 --> 00:07:37,880
