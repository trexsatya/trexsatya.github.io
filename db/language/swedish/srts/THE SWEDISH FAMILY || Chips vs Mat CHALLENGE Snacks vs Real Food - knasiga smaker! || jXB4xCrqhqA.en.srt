1
00:00:00,129 --> 00:00:03,910
Mix, mix, mix.

2
00:00:04,219 --> 00:00:06,948
Chips with hot dog flavor.

3
00:00:08,337 --> 00:00:09,617
Huh?

4
00:00:10,241 --> 00:00:12,241
(Alma screams)

5
00:00:21,401 --> 00:00:24,200
Hello Hello!

6
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:29,400
In our last video we asked you what you want to see on our channel.

7
00:00:29,536 --> 00:00:32,000
It was a lot of people who wrote different things.

8
00:00:32,200 --> 00:00:36,836
- Kung Fu!
 - Kung Fu?
 Yes maybe.

9
00:00:37,546 --> 00:00:39,546
(Shoulder) oh.

10
00:00:40,520 --> 00:00:43,691
(Axel) Aj, aj ... Hörrudu!

11
00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:48,960
There were several of you who wanted to see "Challenge".

12
00:00:49,107 --> 00:00:51,320
- "Challenge".
 - Yes!

13
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:55,480
After all, we have done "Gummy vs. Real Food" on this channel before.

14
00:00:55,640 --> 00:01:03,363
But since we are in Portugal, we have noticed that there are a lot of exciting chip flavors, so today we do ...

15
00:01:03,560 --> 00:01:04,420
Kung Fu!

16
00:01:04,540 --> 00:01:06,760
No, not again.

17
00:01:06,974 --> 00:01:11,846
We make chips vs.
 Real food!

18
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
- Are you tagged?
 - (both) Yes!

19
00:01:14,131 --> 00:01:15,720
- Should we get started?
 - (both) Yes!

20
00:01:15,800 --> 00:01:18,371
- Okay!
 - (both) Yes!

21
00:01:20,039 --> 00:01:22,877
Chips with ketchup flavor ...

22
00:01:23,289 --> 00:01:25,440
... or ketchup.

23
00:01:42,403 --> 00:01:44,320
Here you go.

24
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:47,920
- Harry, should we drive "mix"?
 - Okay, once.

25
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:55,380
Mix, mix, mix.
 Mix, mix, mix.

26
00:01:55,716 --> 00:01:58,996
Okay, should we drive?
 1, 2, 3.

27
00:02:00,001 --> 00:02:02,001
Ketchup?

28
00:02:02,361 --> 00:02:04,988
Ketchup chips?

29
00:02:05,477 --> 00:02:11,254
Yes.
 There are chips with ketchup flavor, or ketchup.

30
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,787
Okay!

31
00:02:16,271 --> 00:02:23,274
- Do they taste ketchup?
 - A little.
 Maybe you should dip them in ketchup?

32
00:02:24,355 --> 00:02:26,529
Then they taste a little better.

33
00:02:26,700 --> 00:02:30,000
- Can I taste?
 - mm.

34
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:33,831
They are very good!

35
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:38,692
Do not force from someone else's plate.

36
00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:44,072
- Okay, next.
 - Yes, next.

37
00:02:44,561 --> 00:02:50,461
Chips with taste of air -dried ham, or air -dried ham.

38
00:03:05,663 --> 00:03:10,126
- "Bon Appétit."
 (Tasty meal) - I don't want to mix.
 No, Harry.

39
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:14,316
No, I don't want to mix either.
 1, 2, 3!

40
00:03:14,691 --> 00:03:19,720
- Ham?
 - ham chips?
 "What the ..." (what in ...)

41
00:03:20,128 --> 00:03:22,900
(Alma) So ... Oh ...

42
00:03:23,157 --> 00:03:25,029
"Oh my God."
 (Oh my God)

43
00:03:25,466 --> 00:03:27,466
Test.

44
00:03:28,931 --> 00:03:30,931
!

45
00:03:36,196 --> 00:03:38,590
Next chips.

46
00:03:41,741 --> 00:03:44,720
Was the ham good?

47
00:03:44,951 --> 00:03:47,461
No.
 Yuk.

48
00:03:48,232 --> 00:03:51,640
This was not a real hit, that is.

49
00:03:51,960 --> 00:04:00,138
But corner, another thing.
 A "challenge" must have a winner, and I don't really know how to rate this.

50
00:04:00,292 --> 00:04:06,648
We can make the one who gets the most snacks wins.
 Or we can let viewers decide.

51
00:04:07,008 --> 00:04:10,200
- Yes.
 What do you think?
 - I think most snacks.

52
00:04:10,320 --> 00:04:14,717
- But then you will win!
 - How do you know that?
 We have lots more.

53
00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:18,001
Yes, we actually have.
 We have many left.

54
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:23,387
We can do so that if you have any ideas you can comment on them below.

55
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:29,455
Or if you think someone won, then you can comment.

56
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:34,600
Comment below!

57
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:39,888
But you have to wait to comment until you have seen everything.

58
00:04:40,121 --> 00:04:42,121
- Yes.
 - Yes.

59
00:04:42,280 --> 00:04:44,421
- Smurf.
 - Smurf.

60
00:04:44,653 --> 00:04:46,521
- Smurf.
 - Smurf.

61
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:47,573
(Both at the same time) Smurf!

62
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:52,442
Chips with a taste of pepper, or pepper.

63
00:04:59,228 --> 00:05:11,160
And since there is a little red paprika powder in the picture here, we take some paprika powder on the bell pepper as well.

64
00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:16,800
Here you go.

65
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:22,176
- No, Harry.
 Don't peek.
 - No, I smell.

66
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:28,515
- I want to change.
 - I don't want to change.

67
00:05:29,837 --> 00:05:33,619
- Okay.
 - 1, 2, 3.

68
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:36,120
I knew it.

69
00:05:36,280 --> 00:05:40,229
- Paprika?
 - With something on.

70
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:51,115
- What's that?
 - something.
 Yuk.
 What is this?
 Pepper with something on.

71
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:54,560
Test, then.

72
00:05:54,747 --> 00:05:58,718
Okay.
 1, 2, 3.

73
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,302
Mm.
 They were totally okay.

74
00:06:13,527 --> 00:06:16,659
- Test mine.
 - Okay.

75
00:06:21,144 --> 00:06:23,144
Ouch.

76
00:06:24,651 --> 00:06:30,600
Ugh, what disgusting!
 Can I have water?
 Mom, can I have water?

77
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:33,400
I also hate peppers.

78
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:42,793
Chips with the taste of "Pizza Double Pepperoni", or "Pizza Double Pepperoni".

79
00:06:45,509 --> 00:06:49,800
- (Harry) Ah!
 - Oh!
 Here you go.

80
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,880
Thanks thanks.

81
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:58,070
- I don't want to change.
 This smells like something good.
 - Mix, mix, mix ...

82
00:06:58,276 --> 00:07:02,800
- Stop smelling!
 - I don't remember what it smells like.

83
00:07:02,904 --> 00:07:06,617
- But should we drive "mix"?
 - No!

84
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:10,600
- Mix, mix, mix ... - no.

85
00:07:10,838 --> 00:07:12,831
Okay then.

86
00:07:13,004 --> 00:07:15,706
1, 2, 3.

87
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:23,284
- Pizza!
 - Pizza!
 Wait, this must be pizzaips, then.

88
00:07:23,480 --> 00:07:26,400
- Pizza, pizza, pizza ... - okay, should we eat?

89
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:30,320
- Yes.
 - 1, 2, 3.

90
00:07:36,254 --> 00:07:41,200
Mm, they were pretty good, but they don't taste pizza.

91
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:46,728
Chips with taste of corn, or corn.

92
00:08:01,514 --> 00:08:06,730
- That pizza is probably my new favorite pizza.
 - It's called Peperonipizza.

93
00:08:06,987 --> 00:08:08,809
Asagod.

94
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:13,400
"Double Pepperoni Pizza."
 But this is something else.

95
00:08:13,760 --> 00:08:16,600
1, 2, 3!

96
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:21,320
- (Alma) What is this?
 - (Harry) corn chips.

97
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:24,482
Maize!
 Maize!
 Maize!

98
00:08:28,527 --> 00:08:32,040
They are so good!
 They taste like little corn ...

99
00:08:32,130 --> 00:08:35,051
No.
 Okay then.

100
00:08:36,431 --> 00:08:43,416
- Do you like corn?
 - They taste like little "corns".
 "I love corn."

101
00:08:45,320 --> 00:08:51,218
So, these chips are so cute.
 They are my new favorite chips.

102
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:53,880
- How nice!
 Are they good, then?
 - mm.

103
00:08:53,960 --> 00:08:58,695
Great.
 Do you have any control over who has got the most chips?

104
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:00,880
- I!
 I!
 I!
 - you?

105
00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:03,080
I think it's Harry.

106
00:09:03,160 --> 00:09:09,123
Now that we are halfway in our "Challenge", I thought we would take a question of the day.

107
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:10,971
Yes!

108
00:09:11,357 --> 00:09:18,155
Where do you want to live when you get old?
 Or, not old.
 When you grow up.

109
00:09:18,280 --> 00:09:21,646
- Tokyo in Japan.
 - MHMM!

110
00:09:21,874 --> 00:09:27,489
- In a high-rise.
 - Oh.
 Then we have to move to Tokyo all.

111
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:30,400
- Or just Harry.
 - mm.

112
00:09:30,520 --> 00:09:38,040
I think I would rather ... or, I would like to live a little type everywhere.
 Like, in different periods.

113
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:45,080
I don't want any permanent home.
 I want to be able to, like ...

114
00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:48,755
You understand what I mean.

115
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:52,949
- You want to be able to travel around and discover the world.
 - Yes!

116
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,388
Okay.
 Should we drive next?

117
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:57,581
- Yes!
 - Okay.

118
00:09:57,819 --> 00:10:01,000
- (Alma) Nam-Nam.
 - (Axel) Nämen ...

119
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:04,035
(Axel) But, hello ...

120
00:10:04,550 --> 00:10:08,950
- (Axel) What are you doing?
 - I did too.

121
00:10:09,280 --> 00:10:17,145
Chips with hot dog flavor, or ... hot dog.

122
00:10:19,597 --> 00:10:23,600
Mix, mix, mix.

123
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:28,211
Mix, mix, mix.

124
00:10:31,511 --> 00:10:33,160
So there.

125
00:10:33,262 --> 00:10:37,638
Mix, mix, mix!
 Mix, mix, mix!

126
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:42,960
Mix, mix, mix!
 Mix, mix, mix!

127
00:10:43,153 --> 00:10:46,687
Okay.
 1, 2, 3!

128
00:10:53,596 --> 00:10:55,159
Sausage.

129
00:10:56,339 --> 00:11:00,280
- (Harry) huh?
 - (Alma) sausage chips.
 Okay.

130
00:11:00,549 --> 00:11:04,752
They were very good!
 Mmm!

131
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:09,982
Cold sausage.

132
00:11:12,622 --> 00:11:17,840
Yes, unfortunately, the sausage has become cold.
 Hope it does nothing.

133
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:26,430
It's just mustard on it, and it's because it was just mustard on the sausage on the chip bag.

134
00:11:26,687 --> 00:11:29,547
These were very good!

135
00:11:32,799 --> 00:11:36,400
These are chips I would definitely buy.

136
00:11:36,680 --> 00:11:46,718
Chips with taste of sour cream and black pepper, or sour cream with black pepper.

137
00:11:50,075 --> 00:11:52,075
So there.

138
00:11:57,366 --> 00:11:59,720
No, you have to skull.

139
00:11:59,802 --> 00:12:02,541
- Are you ready?
 - Yes!

140
00:12:07,275 --> 00:12:10,289
Yes, we are ready.

141
00:12:11,560 --> 00:12:13,360
Here you go.

142
00:12:13,505 --> 00:12:17,852
Mix, mix, mix!
 Mix, mix, mix!

143
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:22,263
Mix, mix, mix!
 Mix.

144
00:12:22,597 --> 00:12:26,370
1, 2, 3!
 "Voilà."

145
00:12:26,845 --> 00:12:28,785
What was there that flew there?

146
00:12:31,735 --> 00:12:35,853
Well ... I happened to ...

147
00:12:37,223 --> 00:12:41,400
- So ... what's that?
 - I do not know.

148
00:12:41,560 --> 00:12:49,196
- Type sour cream and something.
 - sour cream and pepper, I think.

149
00:12:51,948 --> 00:12:54,823
Not the worst, actually.

150
00:12:56,673 --> 00:12:58,673
Test.

151
00:13:04,297 --> 00:13:05,680
(Harry) Mmm.

152
00:13:08,967 --> 00:13:10,272
Eww.

153
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:17,536
- None of this I would buy.
 Never ... in my entire life.
 - I would buy it and it.
 I think both were great.

154
00:13:17,716 --> 00:13:19,960
- For real?
 - mm.

155
00:13:20,060 --> 00:13:22,840
Okay.
 Next chips.

156
00:13:23,300 --> 00:13:27,794
Large cheeses, or a large cheese.

157
00:13:43,943 --> 00:13:46,509
- Here you go.
 - Thanks.

158
00:13:46,640 --> 00:13:49,661
1, 2, 3.

159
00:13:52,080 --> 00:13:54,880
Cheese!
 Cheese!

160
00:13:55,880 --> 00:14:00,800
Mom ... You know that Alma is crazy in cheese.

161
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:05,682
I like this here, anyway.
 Mmm!

162
00:14:06,206 --> 00:14:14,927
- aren't these very classic?
 These with cheese, and that one.
 - (Joanna) Well.
 Are they boring?

163
00:14:15,056 --> 00:14:16,973
They are very good!

164
00:14:17,080 --> 00:14:20,170
- Can I taste?
 - mm.

165
00:14:20,556 --> 00:14:26,257
- It tastes ... regular cheeses.
 - I'll test this one.

166
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:34,195
Damn*is, what a big bit you take.

167
00:14:37,002 --> 00:14:42,190
I will get cramps in my teeth!

168
00:14:49,833 --> 00:14:53,430
I have to spit out!

169
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:56,351
No, I was just kidding.

170
00:14:57,400 --> 00:15:01,489
- Now you have almost eaten dinner, it seems.
 - Yes.

171
00:15:01,640 --> 00:15:07,400
It looks like you are starting to get saturated.
 Those chews were not small, that is.

172
00:15:07,800 --> 00:15:12,000
Now there is only one chips left.

173
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:17,200
- Shall we drive?
 - Yes.
 "Moment of Truth."
 (The moment of truth)

174
00:15:17,400 --> 00:15:24,316
"Moment of Truth."
 It sounds like any Thor movie.
 Giant cool.

175
00:15:28,961 --> 00:15:35,587
Chips with a taste of red chili, or red chili.

176
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:46,374
  LA-LA-LA-LA, LA-LA, LA-LA!

177
00:15:46,591 --> 00:15:53,040
So, I thought you were like this when we tested sweets, but it seems to be the "Challenge" itself.

178
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:58,390
Mix, mix, mix!
 Mix, mix, mix!

179
00:15:58,560 --> 00:16:01,320
Mix, mix, mix!

180
00:16:01,480 --> 00:16:03,945
Mix, mix, mix.

181
00:16:04,080 --> 00:16:06,630
1, 2, 3!

182
00:16:09,934 --> 00:16:13,000
No!
 No!
 In other words...

183
00:16:13,228 --> 00:16:15,720
I refuse this.

184
00:16:15,818 --> 00:16:18,880
- What?
 Surely there is no danger?
 - I've tested these before.
 They are so strong.

185
00:16:18,960 --> 00:16:24,000
- You can?
 - Yes, of course.
 We do it together.

186
00:16:24,983 --> 00:16:27,781
- Here.
 - Okay.

187
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:32,157
- 1, 2 ... - But Harry, then?
 Here.

188
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:35,280
- No, I eat my own.
 - He eats chips.

189
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:37,952
1, 2, 3.

190
00:16:40,324 --> 00:16:45,051
(Alma screams)

191
00:16:55,520 --> 00:16:59,741
- (Joanna) How are your chips, then?
 - They are totally okay.

192
00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:01,720
Isn't that strong?

193
00:17:01,899 --> 00:17:08,160
No.
 I think I'll test.
 Will probably bull on the tongue.
 Have you tested chili before?

194
00:17:08,279 --> 00:17:09,060
Mm.

195
00:17:09,120 --> 00:17:10,532
- Does it hurt?
 - No.

196
00:17:10,560 --> 00:17:14,281
- Is it hot?
 - No, there is no danger.

197
00:17:23,772 --> 00:17:27,737
- What is the situation, Harry?
 - I ate one.

198
00:17:27,994 --> 00:17:30,382
Oh.

199
00:17:36,181 --> 00:17:41,594
I never do that!
 That was so awful!

200
00:17:42,257 --> 00:17:50,765
That was very strong.
 And I think I lost the bill a little bit on who has got the most chips.

201
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:57,982
- My breath is still warm.
 - Yes.
 It's like the eyelashes curl together like small blinds.

202
00:17:58,080 --> 00:18:05,400
I think I've won for I for that one, and I've been off to myself most today.

203
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:12,302
Oh really?
 I think the viewers should decide who won.
 What do you think, Harry?

204
00:18:12,482 --> 00:18:15,001
The viewers I with.

205
00:18:15,181 --> 00:18:19,800
Everyone got a little lever on this strong ending.

206
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:24,568
Should we ... Nämen listen, I don't want anymore.
 No, away!

207
00:18:26,138 --> 00:18:29,041
- Should we say thank you for today?
 - Yes!

208
00:18:29,221 --> 00:18:34,200
Thank you for watching this videooon!

209
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:36,000
Bye!

210
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:39,720
Oh my God!
 Okay.
 Bye!

211
00:18:39,800 --> 00:18:41,925
BYE!
