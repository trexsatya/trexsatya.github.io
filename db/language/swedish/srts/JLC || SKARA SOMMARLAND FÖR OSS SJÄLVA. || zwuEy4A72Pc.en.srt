I also said it, you are so damn close to hitting everything.

176
00:07:53,902 --> 00:07:56,894
Bieber!
 -What fucking bieber!

177
00:07:56,894 --> 00:08:02,297
[Sings made] "and I don't want the world to see me ..."

178
00:08:02,297 --> 00:08:04,734
How is it going?
 [Niclas] -What emo ...

179
00:08:04,734 --> 00:08:06,979
How's the song going?
 [Niclas] He who has the strawberry?

180
00:08:06,979 --> 00:08:09,509
[Niclas] HA!
 Which one is now again?

181
00:08:09,509 --> 00:08:12,561
"And I don't want ..." [laughter]

182
00:08:12,561 --> 00:08:17,205
How the hell does it go?
 [Niclas] No!
 No!
 It's not "Cut My Life"

183
00:08:17,205 --> 00:08:19,427
Comment if you know who it is!
 See you!

184
00:08:19,427 --> 00:08:21,376
[Giggle]

185
00:08:21,376 --> 00:08:22,367
[Singing voice is heard on the screen]

186
00:08:22,367 --> 00:08:26,498
[Sings made] "'Cause tonight will be the night that I will fall for you!"

187
00:08:26,498 --> 00:08:28,187
"'Cause tonight ..." [laughter]

188
00:08:28,187 --> 00:08:29,702
[Laughter] It's it!

189
00:08:29,702 --> 00:08:30,903
The strawberry!

190
00:08:30,903 --> 00:08:35,103
After all, someone has made an emo-earth guy!
 [Someone sings on the song in the background]

191
00:08:35,103 --> 00:08:39,568
[Men's voice sings] "'Cause Tonight Will Be The Night That I Will Fall For You!"

192
00:08:39,568 --> 00:08:45,848
From free fall, Skara Summerland and Rutch canoes to the motorhome and advertising for Air Up.

193
00:08:45,848 --> 00:08:47,245
We've worked with these before,

194
00:08:47,245 --> 00:08:48,823
And it's so amazing, for:

195
00:08:48,823 --> 00:08:52,372
You buy one like this and you put a capsule on,

196
00:08:52,372 --> 00:08:58,817
And then you drink, and then you are tricked via the scent capsule that the water tastes just that taste it stands.

197
00:08:58,817 --> 00:09:03,318
And what is also great that this is the new bottle, such a metal bottle.

198
00:09:03,318 --> 00:09:04,802
So it keeps cold very good.

199
00:09:04,802 --> 00:09:07,225
So you pour cold water here it is cold for a long time.

200
00:09:07,225 --> 00:09:10,482
Such a taste pod is five liters of water,

201
00:09:10,482 --> 00:09:14,054
So you don't have to go to the store, you don't have to buy lots of plastic bottles that you then throw away.

202
00:09:14,054 --> 00:09:16,512
So this is a more environmentally friendly alternative as well.

203
00:09:16,512 --> 00:09:19,623
And so it is also that summer is nearing its end.

204
00:09:19,623 --> 00:09:23,516
People start working, you may start training again, and then you need to drink plenty of water.

205
00:09:23,516 --> 00:09:27,077
And why drink out of glass when you can do it in a slightly more fun way?

206
00:09:27,077 --> 00:09:28,271
And taste.
 -Check this out.

207
00:09:28,271 --> 00:09:31,426
Look how fun this is.
 [Laughing to be done]

208
00:09:31,426 --> 00:09:34,427
There are over 25 flavors, we have lots that are here in front.

209
00:09:34,427 --> 00:09:36,635
I want to test this "sweet coconut".
 [Jonas] But you!

210
00:09:36,635 --> 00:09:40,526
I changed the taste now ... Winter apple, what is the difference between winter apple and regular apple?

211
00:09:40,526 --> 00:09:42,506
So then it is with cinnamon and stuff in!

212
00:09:42,506 --> 00:09:45,342
Apple and cinnamon ... like a little ... -Fan what a cozy!

213
00:09:45,342 --> 00:09:46,818
Oh!

214
00:09:46,818 --> 00:09:48,117
Apple pie!

215
00:09:48,117 --> 00:09:49,681
Oh!
 -I get smelling?

216
00:09:49,681 --> 00:09:53,284
Mmm!
 Smell Coconut.

217
00:09:53,284 --> 00:09:55,264
You are!

218
00:09:55,264 --> 00:09:58,167
It smells creamy.
 I'll test it so we'll see ...

219
00:09:58,167 --> 00:10:01,179
Mmm, "Sweet Coconut", I recommend it.

220
00:10:01,179 --> 00:10:02,575
And this is how it is: we have a code for you now,

221
00:10:02,575 --> 00:10:05,300
It's JLC10, so you get ten (10%) percent discount.

222
00:10:05,300 --> 00:10:06,703
So click on the link in the description,

223
00:10:06,703 --> 00:10:10,238
Go in and treat yourself to a bottle.
 Drink water!
 You forget it.
 You have to drink more water.

224
00:10:10,238 --> 00:10:11,951
And the code is valid for fifth (5) September.

225
00:10:11,951 --> 00:10:15,737
It cannot be combined with other offers ... so.

226
00:10:15,737 --> 00:10:19,762
Go to the link in the description and see if something is right for you.

227
00:10:19,762 --> 00:10:21,493
Listen to this then.
 Back to the Rutch Canoes.

228
00:10:21,493 --> 00:10:24,696
Who wants to go with Strawberry?
 [Lucas] But you go together.

229
00:10:24,696 --> 00:10:26,549
Yes.
 [Lucas] -Co it.

230
00:10:26,549 --> 00:10:28,603
It does not matter.
 -Why?

231
00:10:28,603 --> 00:10:31,780
No, but do you.
 You should not sit two so big in these.

232
00:10:31,780 --> 00:10:33,415
Because you go into the wall.

233
00:10:33,415 --> 00:10:36,627
Three, two one ... drive!

234
00:10:36,627 --> 00:10:40,519
[They sing] "'Cause Tonight Will Be The Night That I Will Fall For You"

235
00:10:40,519 --> 00:10:42,972
We take .... Oh damn!

236
00:10:42,972 --> 00:10:46,250
[Cry]

237
00:10:46,250 --> 00:10:48,835
No no no!

238
00:10:48,835 --> 00:10:50,386
[Laughter behind the camera]

239
00:10:50,386 --> 00:10:52,402
AJ my wrists!

240
00:10:52,402 --> 00:10:56,390
[Niclas] It was exactly as you said Lucas!

241
00:10:56,390 --> 00:10:59,154
[Laughter] aj ... aj ... aj ...

242
00:10:59,154 --> 00:11:03,211
[Laughter] Aj my wrists!

243
00:11:03,211 --> 00:11:07,229
[Laugh]

244
00:11:07,229 --> 00:11:11,052
We are at the final!
 No I won't go there.

245
00:11:11,052 --> 00:11:14,450
Oh damn!
 -Here, take this one and film out there.

246
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:18,320
Should I go first then?
 -Yes, do you want it?

247
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:19,752
Yes.
 -You, if you want it.

248
00:11:19,752 --> 00:11:23,325
Ah but ... -do you keep it?

249
00:11:23,325 --> 00:11:25,165
Yes I thought so.
 -Oh my God.

250
00:11:25,165 --> 00:11:28,568
This was much scary than ... -drive hard Lucas!

251
00:11:28,568 --> 00:11:30,391
Yeah!
 [From the picture] -You probably survive.

252
00:11:30,391 --> 00:11:32,270
Yes drive, probably anyway.

253
00:11:32,270 --> 00:11:35,068
It feels like I'm falling backwards ... [behind the camera] Oh my God ...

254
00:11:35,068 --> 00:11:37,063
[Behind the camera] I love you!

255
00:11:37,063 --> 00:11:41,954
Lucas!
 [Voice in the background] "Three, Two, one ..."

256
00:11:41,954 --> 00:11:45,182
[Carl, cut] Oh damn!

257
00:11:45,182 --> 00:11:52,628
... ...

258
00:11:52,628 --> 00:11:55,844
[Loudly] Oh!
 What a shock!

259
00:11:55,844 --> 00:11:58,952
Hell!
 I just disappeared!

260
00:11:58,952 --> 00:12:00,284
So in myself!

261
00:12:00,284 --> 00:12:01,745
Hell what it was going on!

262
00:12:01,745 --> 00:12:06,926
Ah but in the beginning you know, the hand stopped and the body went down,

263
00:12:06,926 --> 00:12:08,460
So I probably didn't get it on the camera ...

264
00:12:08,460 --> 00:12:11,315
Oh I get shaky ... Satan!

265
00:12:11,315 --> 00:12:15,102
Should I drive now?
 [Carl] -come again now Jonas, should I run last?

266
00:12:15,102 --> 00:12:15,939
Yes.

267
00:12:15,939 --> 00:12:17,409
[Laughs] "Yes" you say?
 How does it feel?

268
00:12:17,409 --> 00:12:20,109
Oh fuck what scary.
 -It's just back with your head and breathing.

269
00:12:20,109 --> 00:12:22,378
Lucas solved it gallantly, he's down there waiting for you.

270
00:12:22,378 --> 00:12:24,980
Here we go!
 -Come again Jonas!

271
00:12:24,980 --> 00:12:26,163
I love you!

272
00:12:26,827 --> 00:12:29,650
Oh fuck.
 [Voice in the background] "Three, Two, one ..."

273
00:12:38,040 --> 00:12:41,555
[Lucas laughs] -Oh gentlemen!

274
00:12:41,555 --> 00:12:44,985
Aaaah!

275
00:12:44,985 --> 00:12:48,193
It's just small!
 And my legs!

276
00:12:48,193 --> 00:12:50,235
[Lucas] Surely it is shaky now?
 -If i'm shaking yes?

277
00:12:50,235 --> 00:12:53,119
This one was ball but not so fun.

278
00:12:53,119 --> 00:12:55,091
The first two seconds so you think you are almost dying

279
00:12:55,091 --> 00:12:57,010
It just gets completely white and black and ...

280
00:12:57,010 --> 00:12:58,370
It feels like you are falling right down!
 -Yes!
 Yes Yes.

281
00:12:58,370 --> 00:13:01,151
That you are going down in some fucking concrete lump type.

282
00:13:01,151 --> 00:13:03,858
Oh fuck.

283
00:13:03,858 --> 00:13:06,781
This doesn't feel good.
 Oh damn, I'll be vomiting.

284
00:13:06,781 --> 00:13:08,802
[Voice outside] ready?
 -Yes!

285
00:13:08,802 --> 00:13:11,921
[Inaudible]

286
00:13:11,921 --> 00:13:19,625
... ...

287
00:13:19,625 --> 00:13:21,160
Oh damn!
 Woah!

288
00:13:21,160 --> 00:13:24,419
Lets go home!
 Lets go home.

289
00:13:24,419 --> 00:13:27,164
AAAAAH!

290
00:13:27,164 --> 00:13:30,897
Surely it was sick?
 -Yes I hate this damn shit!

291
00:13:30,897 --> 00:13:31,893
Shaky in the legs?

292
00:13:31,893 --> 00:13:33,755
They were on and say they would push and not push me away,

293
00:13:33,755 --> 00:13:36,547
And fucking and opening the door and then I said that "do you do it then, then I faint and spit"!

294
00:13:36,547 --> 00:13:38,753
But do you feel shaking in your legs now or?

295
00:13:38,753 --> 00:13:41,311
"Kobra" was the more fun, this one was not fun.

296
00:13:41,311 --> 00:13:42,977
But do you know what is good anyway?
 -That you have done it?

297
00:13:42,977 --> 00:13:45,192
Aaa, and that it goes so fast that you don't get what happens.
 -Yes!
 No I know!

298
00:13:45,192 --> 00:13:47,147
The first thing you think when you go down BA:

299
00:13:47,147 --> 00:13:49,234
"Damn how fast it goes" and then it is very soft ...

300
00:13:49,234 --> 00:13:52,680
[Screams] Yes!
 YES!
 -Yes and it just gets black and white and ...

301
00:13:52,680 --> 00:13:55,094
Ah Fy Fan ... -I'm shaking.

302
00:13:55,094 --> 00:13:56,502
I got such a kick when I came down, you were not there then.

303
00:13:56,502 --> 00:14:00,666
I told Jonas "Yes!"
 -No you didn't, you pray "Now we go home!"

304
00:14:00,666 --> 00:14:01,744
"Now we go home, now we go home!"
 -As he?

305
00:14:01,744 --> 00:14:05,997
[Mimic Carl] "Nah! Now we go home! Jonas, I don't want to be involved in this, now we go home!"

306
00:14:05,997 --> 00:14:08,499
After that came the kick and then I said "Yes!"

307
00:14:08,499 --> 00:14:12,640
A day at Skara, it was as you said Calle.
 It was much more fun than I thought it would be.

308
00:14:12,640 --> 00:14:16,586
[In chorus] Yes.
 You think so "Rutchkana" but damn it ... and it's zero sponsored collaboration.
 I think it was fucking fun.

309
00:14:16,586 --> 00:14:19,227
Do you know what I think ... -Stort thanks to Skara Summerland for being here.

310
00:14:19,227 --> 00:14:21,581
They have let us be here and have some fun.
 -Really.

311
00:14:21,581 --> 00:14:22,846
Do you know what I think?
 -No?

312
00:14:22,846 --> 00:14:26,784
Don't forget to give a thumbs up and comment, but ...

313
00:14:26,784 --> 00:14:31,999
I think it was so damn fun to go to the US, the biggest amusement park and the biggest water park.

314
00:14:31,999 --> 00:14:34,926
[In chorus] Yes.
 -And big thanks to our lifeguards,

315
00:14:34,926 --> 00:14:37,528
Adam and Rickard.
 -No problem!

316
00:14:37,528 --> 00:14:39,756
Thanks for the help!

317
00:14:39,756 --> 00:14:42,335
You know what?
 Now you have to shower huh?
 -Yes!

318
00:14:42,335 --> 00:14:43,095
[Laugh]
