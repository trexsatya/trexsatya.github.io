1
00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:22.960
-Tell me now.
 - Heads dress up as a police officer.

2
00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:30.000
He arrests me, puts on me handcuffs and body visits me.

3
00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:39.600
- This is a bit embarrassing ... - Stretching!

4
00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:44.560
Magnus usually wants to dress up for Santa Claus.

5
00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:52.000
I'll sit in his lap and whisper in his ear.
 Then I can open the package.

6
00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:55.040
What sexy.

7
00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:02.560
Ulf usually plays that he has been raped by bears.

8
00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:08.720
I get to patch up his butt.
 Then we don't come much anymore.

9
00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:50.320
The feeling of sitting in a suburban apartment with cable ...

10
00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:56.080
- Is it a new record?
 -Yes.
 Dr. Kosmos is called.

11
00:02:56.240 --> 00:02:59.240
Magnus got it from John.

12
00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:04.960
I have never cooked this before, but we have a vegetarian here ...

13
00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:08.080
Well, you are a vegetarian?

14
00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:12.200
I feel better about not eating meat.

15
00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:15.160
Yes, you get a little damn with meat.

16
00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:20.520
Like after the Christmas table.
 It is almost so you want to vomit.

17
00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:27.680
- Johannes lives in a collective as well.
 - Yeah ...!
 How many do you live there?

18
00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:33.280
- We are ten people.
 - Ty you live together - as in the lump!

19
00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:39.520
There is something certain about spending time with only men.

20
00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:42.840
- There are girls there too.
 - you?!

21
00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:48.320
There is something certain about spending time with women.
 Kristina and I socialize ...

22
00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:53.800
Do girls live there too?!
 What do you say about it, Jenny?

23
00:03:53.960 --> 00:04:00.160
- They are his friends.
 - We are not together because we live together.

24
00:04:00.320 --> 00:04:05.320
It would feel good to have a small harem.

25
00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:12.480
It is probably good with things like that, but you yourself are a little too selfish.

26
00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:16.280
No thanks.
 I do not drink alcohol.

27
00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:31.080
- You don't chop, then?
 - No, I've stopped drinking alcohol.

28
00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:37.960
- But I like to take mineral water.
 - mineral water ... we haven't.

29
00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:42.760
- I go and buy.
 - I can take something else.

30
00:04:42.920 --> 00:04:48.760
Of course, you should have mineral water.
 But it's closed down there ...

31
00:04:48.920 --> 00:04:53.280
- I take the car.
 - No, you have been drinking!

32
00:04:53.440 --> 00:04:58.240
- Water is going well ... - We can order a taxi god.

33
00:04:58.400 --> 00:05:04.400
Yes!
 We ask the taxi driver to buy mineral water in the on -call shop.

34
00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:10.200
It's not necessary.
 It costs a lot of money ...

35
00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:14.280
- You should have mineral water!
 You are a guest.
 - Cider goes well.

36
00:05:14.440 --> 00:05:19.720
- No, you should have mineral water.
 - Yes, yes ... nice it should be.

37
00:05:48.800 --> 00:05:53.560
The doorbell

38
00:05:48.800 --> 00:05:53.560
It is the taxi driver.

39
00:06:05.360 --> 00:06:10.960
They only had mixed juice.
 It cost SEK 430.

40
00:06:43.520 --> 00:06:47.840
Take wine, John.
 You can take a little!

41
00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:53.800
You live with a lot of girls.
 And you drink red wine.

42
00:06:53.960 --> 00:06:59.040
No, not red wine, but you are in the process of hash and stuff.

43
00:06:59.200 --> 00:07:05.680
Then you can't stay in the skin.
 I wonder what Jenny thinks about it.

44
00:07:05.840 --> 00:07:09.200
Or are you gay?

45
00:07:10.480 --> 00:07:16.360
Do what you want in the collective.
 But now you are among people, so give a damn in Frida.

46
00:07:16.520 --> 00:07:19.760
Give damn in all the girls here!
 Except Jenny.

47
00:07:19.920 --> 00:07:26.320
You talk about being a vegetarian, but you have a leather jacket!

48
00:07:26.480 --> 00:07:31.640
Take some wine now and be like a human being, for damn!

49
00:07:32.440 --> 00:07:38.320
What a fucking shit music you have with you!
 I'm changing!

50
00:07:38.480 --> 00:07:41.520
I have a question:

51
00:07:41.680 --> 00:07:45.920
When you go naked and you have a stand ...

52
00:07:48.320 --> 00:07:50.560
Yeah!

53
00:07:51.480 --> 00:07:56.920
This is called Rock!
 You don't have that in your fucking collective.

54
00:07:59.600 --> 00:08:05.480
When you drive on a deer with the common car, what do you do?

55
00:08:05.640 --> 00:08:09.440
- Do you club it, or do it suffer?
 –You, Ulf ...

56
00:08:09.600 --> 00:08:14.480
Give damn my guy!
 Why don't you drink wine?

57
00:08:14.640 --> 00:08:17.880
Do you want to fight with me?
 Huh?

58
00:08:18.040 --> 00:08:23.400
- Now you calm down!
 - He has a knife!

59
00:08:24.200 --> 00:08:28.720
Go from here now, John.
 It will be best.

60
00:08:28.880 --> 00:08:34.000
Go now.
 Thanks for tonight!
 I will call you back.

61
00:08:34.160 --> 00:08:37.240
He is waving a fucking knife ...

62
00:08:37.400 --> 00:08:43.360
I am really sorry.
 I had no idea he was so crazy.

63
00:08:53.840 --> 00:08:59.000
- Is it the first time?
 - No, I have a season ticket.

64
00:08:59.160 --> 00:09:05.560
Me and the lady will be in shape.
 You can't be a thick on the beach!

65
00:09:06.600 --> 00:09:10.640
The lady is over there.
 - Hello, Britt!

66
00:09:20.720 --> 00:09:24.320
- Yenny!
 Hello!
 -Hello!

67
00:09:24.480 --> 00:09:28.200
-Hey!
 Ulf my name is.
 -Hello...

68
00:09:28.360 --> 00:09:33.720
Are you Jenny's new guy?
 It is important to keep up with the turns.

69
00:09:33.880 --> 00:09:37.560
- We have to go now ... - I am kidding.

70
00:09:37.720 --> 00:09:41.840
Clearly you should try yourself!

71
00:09:42.760 --> 00:09:48.720
The last guy she had with her on a couple dinner was a real kuf.

72
00:09:48.880 --> 00:09:55.640
He lived in a hippie collective, where they danced naked and smoked drugs.

73
00:09:55.800 --> 00:10:01.720
However, he could not take a regular glass.
 He looked down at us others.

74
00:10:01.880 --> 00:10:04.560
It was me...

75
00:10:04.720 --> 00:10:10.360
No, it was an idiot.
 Vegetarian with leather jacket.
 A hypocrite!

76
00:10:10.520 --> 00:10:15.560
- Now we should go.
 - We will be seen on a couple dinner sometime.
 Hello!

77
00:10:21.320 --> 00:10:25.920
- Per - Arne!
 - What happened, Carita?

78
00:10:26.080 --> 00:10:30.440
Death was here to pick me up!

79
00:10:30.600 --> 00:10:36.920
I sat here.
 Suddenly the door went up and then a black angel stood there.

80
00:10:38.800 --> 00:10:45.200
It said, "I am the angel of death and have come to pick you up."

81
00:10:45.360 --> 00:10:52.560
"Can't I live a little more? Think of Per -Arne who will be alone!"

82
00:10:52.720 --> 00:10:59.440
The angel says it cannot take it into account.
 I have to come along.

83
00:11:00.640 --> 00:11:05.560
I'm starting to travel, but then I get an idea.

84
00:11:05.720 --> 00:11:10.960
- Here is your party -chip bag.
 - As I have saved all week.

85
00:11:11.120 --> 00:11:17.440
I say to the angel: "If you get this chip bag, can I live then?"

86
00:11:17.600 --> 00:11:23.160
"Yes," the angel says.
 And then it takes the chip bag and goes.

87
00:11:23.320 --> 00:11:27.120
- So, what a lucky thing, Carita!
 -Yes.

88
00:11:29.920 --> 00:11:35.840
- But then I have no chips ... - no, you haven't.

89
00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:39.360
RUSTLE

90
00:11:39.520 --> 00:11:43.000
Damn death!

91
00:11:46.480 --> 00:11:52.400
My new guy usually calls me his beauty.

92
00:11:53.480 --> 00:11:59.120
- I am Magnus "sweetheart".
 - God, what a cute!

93
00:11:59.280 --> 00:12:04.200
Yes ... once Ulf called me mom.

94
00:12:09.840 --> 00:12:14.440
Do you know if there is any mailbox here?

95
00:12:14.600 --> 00:12:17.040
Oh!

96
00:12:22.800 --> 00:12:25.080
Come on!

97
00:12:25.240 --> 00:12:30.080
I don't want any child.
 I don't think about 30 kilos.

98
00:12:30.240 --> 00:12:35.080
In nine months it will be three kilos about Dan - like my laptop.

99
00:12:35.240 --> 00:12:39.760
It's nothing.
 You are a lazy woman!

100
00:12:39.920 --> 00:12:44.760
If the whole world was like you would go down.

101
00:12:44.920 --> 00:12:51.520
- I should cuddle on the child, not you.
 - I have thought about that.
 Check this out.

102
00:12:54.520 --> 00:12:58.880
-What's that?
 - A empathy - stomach!

103
00:12:59.040 --> 00:13:05.440
If I manage to have it at work for a week, we can have children later.

104
00:13:08.640 --> 00:13:13.920
I think we should call him Ove.

105
00:13:17.720 --> 00:13:20.720
Gosh!
 A new!

106
00:13:25.880 --> 00:13:29.960
- What the hell is this?!
 -Sorry...

107
00:13:32.560 --> 00:13:38.640
- Now it will be good with lunch.
 - Yes ... Grandma has made my lunch bag.

108
00:13:39.960 --> 00:13:44.920
–What do you have for a sandwich?
 - salmon, pesto and salad.

109
00:13:45.080 --> 00:13:50.040
Do you want to change?
 I have lung mash and beetroot.

110
00:13:50.200 --> 00:13:52.520
No thanks.

111
00:13:58.360 --> 00:14:03.680
- You have pasta salad.
 Do you want to change?
 -What have you?

112
00:14:05.840 --> 00:14:09.320
–Leverk sausage.
 -No thanks.

113
00:14:09.480 --> 00:14:14.960
Surely?
 If you get such an egg inserted on the purchase, then?

114
00:14:17.920 --> 00:14:22.800
- They are sour.
 - I am craving pasta salad.

115
00:14:28.240 --> 00:14:32.840
- Do you have any dessert?
 -An Apple.

116
00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:36.960
Do you want to change?
 I have a pig foot.

117
00:14:38.760 --> 00:14:41.880
I take the apple.

118
00:14:45.920 --> 00:14:48.560
Hello!
 Hello!

119
00:14:50.960 --> 00:14:55.960
I'm not pregnant.
 It's an empathy.

120
00:14:59.120 --> 00:15:01.960
Oh!

121
00:15:02.880 --> 00:15:06.960
I put the cup on the empathy.

122
00:15:25.640 --> 00:15:28.960
Sure you don't want to change?

123
00:15:32.800 --> 00:15:35.600
Good morning...

124
00:15:39.320 --> 00:15:41.480
Gosh...!

125
00:15:41.640 --> 00:15:44.880
The old man ... what a cute!

126
00:15:47.960 --> 00:15:50.800
What's nice ...

127
00:16:00.880 --> 00:16:03.080
Boxa!

128
00:16:07.120 --> 00:16:12.600
- What kind of essence.
 It thumps in the head.
 -Are you hangover?

129
00:16:12.760 --> 00:16:18.480
Yes, it was quite late yesterday.
 I drank way too much.

130
00:16:18.640 --> 00:16:25.160
First drink, then wine for the food, and then coffee and brandy.

131
00:16:25.320 --> 00:16:30.320
- And then drinks all night.
 - What was you like?

132
00:16:30.480 --> 00:16:34.600
- It was just me.
 - You sat at home yourself?

133
00:16:34.760 --> 00:16:40.000
I don't like to drink among people.
 You do so easily.

134
00:16:40.160 --> 00:16:45.360
It is important to have a healthy relationship with alcohol.

135
00:16:45.520 --> 00:16:51.360
For me it is a relaxation agent.
 I only drink if I am tense.

136
00:16:51.520 --> 00:16:57.160
- You must not end up in an addiction.
 - Spit is like medicine.

137
00:16:57.320 --> 00:17:03.320
If I'm nervous about meeting new people, or driving a car ...

138
00:17:05.800 --> 00:17:08.640
Or as a reward.

139
00:17:08.800 --> 00:17:14.000
After a tough morning at work, you are worth a tuting.

140
00:17:14.160 --> 00:17:20.360
- But never, never before lunch.
 - And never take bottles to work.

141
00:17:20.520 --> 00:17:24.880
- I drive with this one.
 - A shampoo bottle?

142
00:17:25.040 --> 00:17:28.720
Conditioner.
 It fits pretty well.

143
00:17:28.880 --> 00:17:33.200
It is conditioner for the soul.

144
00:17:33.360 --> 00:17:40.040
It is important to be creative with such things.
 I drive with this one.
 Bowl!

145
00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:50.880
Tuesday?
 Not that.
 Wednesday...

146
00:17:51.800 --> 00:17:58.800
What you are cute, Peter!
 You're not like other men.
 You're like a girl.

147
00:17:58.960 --> 00:18:04.040
Like a girl with underwear ... no, like a girl with a beard.

148
00:18:04.200 --> 00:18:06.400
Hello?

149
00:18:14.520 --> 00:18:18.800
What are you doing, Goran?

150
00:18:19.800 --> 00:18:23.840
- I just tag my name.
 -Let's see.

151
00:18:29.760 --> 00:18:32.320
What fat!

152
00:18:43.160 --> 00:18:50.600
I embroider all night.
 If I cut off my arms, I would still embroider.

153
00:18:50.760 --> 00:18:54.880
It knocks

154
00:18:50.760 --> 00:18:54.880
It's the mother!
 Put away the embroidery.

155
00:18:57.240 --> 00:19:04.640
Do you have any special properties that make you suitable for this entry?

156
00:19:06.400 --> 00:19:13.160
I'm good at organizing.
 I am flexible and interested in new ideas

157
00:19:14.240 --> 00:19:18.200
What are your worst features?

158
00:19:19.920 --> 00:19:25.720
In that case, it would be that I take the job too seriously.

159
00:19:25.880 --> 00:19:30.040
I bring the job with me in my spare time.

160
00:19:30.200 --> 00:19:35.200
- And so I abuse heroin.
 -Excuse...?

161
00:19:35.360 --> 00:19:41.760
It discourages some employers, but I have chosen to be honest.

162
00:19:41.920 --> 00:19:46.720
It is another good trait: honesty.

163
00:19:46.880 --> 00:19:51.320
But the job is most important in my life.

164
00:19:51.480 --> 00:19:56.440
That and the heroin.
 They come in split first place.

165
00:19:56.600 --> 00:20:01.640
To be completely honest, heroin is most important.

166
00:20:02.520 --> 00:20:08.120
Just that ... How do you think people who work with you perceive you?

167
00:20:08.280 --> 00:20:13.360
I am perceived as very alert, straight and clear.

168
00:20:13.520 --> 00:20:19.720
Except when I took heroin.
 Then I am vague, incomprehensible and sometimes violent.

169
00:20:22.880 --> 00:20:30.400
You have worked with one of our competitors.
 Why did you stop there?

170
00:20:30.560 --> 00:20:36.960
I needed new challenges.
 I was not allowed to develop my full potential there

171
00:20:37.120 --> 00:20:44.000
And so I used to steal stuff from the company - computers and stuff.

172
00:20:44.160 --> 00:20:47.400
I needed money for heroin.

173
00:20:48.440 --> 00:20:52.440
We have received the information we need.

174
00:20:52.600 --> 00:20:56.520
-We will keep in touch.
 -I keep my fingers crossed!

175
00:20:56.680 --> 00:20:59.840
Can I "postpone" in the lobby?

176
00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:05.640
-Rather not.
 -Okay.
 Then I do it in the park.

177
00:21:11.760 --> 00:21:14.080
Wait!

178
00:21:17.640 --> 00:21:22.800
What you are cute that helps me test this, Peter.

179
00:21:26.720 --> 00:21:29.360
You are a spring, huh?

180
00:21:32.640 --> 00:21:36.440
My pigeons against your pandas.

181
00:21:37.640 --> 00:21:42.360
After all, they are three.
 Yours are just two!

182
00:21:42.520 --> 00:21:46.600
It's flowers and basket and everything ...

183
00:21:46.760 --> 00:21:53.160
But the pandas come from Africa.
 They are dangerous.
 They can king - fu.

184
00:21:53.320 --> 00:21:58.040
But the pigeons have weapons in the basket.

185
00:21:58.200 --> 00:22:02.280
They can shoot all the pandas!

186
00:22:02.440 --> 00:22:09.320
The pandas have bulletproof vests and laser guns.
 They shoot the pigeons!

187
00:22:09.480 --> 00:22:13.440
Do they have it?
 Laser?

188
00:22:13.600 --> 00:22:16.000
Yes!

189
00:22:16.160 --> 00:22:21.640
But then the pigeons' relatives come and fuck your mom!

190
00:22:21.800 --> 00:22:24.640
Yes, it's a deal.

191
00:22:37.600 --> 00:22:42.880
Shit!
 Excuse me, but this card seems totally sick.

192
00:22:43.040 --> 00:22:48.320
If I had been an animal I would have been a rabbit-

193
00:22:48.480 --> 00:22:51.560
- or a nail sculpture.

194
00:22:58.760 --> 00:23:04.360
- What a nice place!
 -Exciting.
 I rarely come out.

195
00:23:05.440 --> 00:23:11.040
- Serve if you see the waitress.
 - Yes, she stands with you.

196
00:23:12.160 --> 00:23:15.040
Oh!
 How nice.

197
00:23:16.720 --> 00:23:22.600
-Do you want to order?
 - What do you have for food?

198
00:23:22.760 --> 00:23:26.920
It says in the menu.
 You have it in your hand.

199
00:23:27.080 --> 00:23:30.080
Oh!
 How nice.

200
00:23:30.920 --> 00:23:33.960
A lot to choose from ...

201
00:23:34.120 --> 00:23:39.480
- We have to think a little.
 - Do you want to drink something for so long?

202
00:23:39.640 --> 00:23:45.440
- Do you serve wine?
 -Yes.
 The wine list is later.

203
00:23:45.600 --> 00:23:47.560
-Where?
 -Where.

204
00:23:47.720 --> 00:23:50.480
Oh!
 How nice.

205
00:23:50.640 --> 00:23:55.040
Then we take the house of the house.

206
00:23:55.200 --> 00:23:58.840
- Can you get water?
 -Where.

207
00:23:59.000 --> 00:24:01.320
Oh!

208
00:24:05.800 --> 00:24:07.960
Exciting!

209
00:25:01.360 --> 00:25:04.880
- What good it was!
 -Yes.

210
00:25:05.040 --> 00:25:09.760
- I would like salt.
 - It's standing there.

211
00:25:09.920 --> 00:25:13.480
Oh!
 Yes ... "Salt".

212
00:25:28.760 --> 00:25:33.160
Sorry I was so impossible before-

213
00:25:33.320 --> 00:25:36.840
- But you can take off your stomach now ...

214
00:25:48.480 --> 00:25:51.760
Here comes the bill.

215
00:25:51.920 --> 00:25:56.600
- Currently, can we pay?
 - The note is there.

216
00:25:56.760 --> 00:25:59.360
Oh!
 How nice.

217
00:27:05.600 --> 00:27:07.760
Program text: Agnes Malm Skoglund (C) Swedish Television AB 2004

218
00:27:18.600 --> 00:27:23.760
- Do you need a personal trainer?
 - No, it's so expensive.

219
00:27:23.920 --> 00:27:31.120
I had it for a while.
 He brought out a barbell and told me: "Lift."

220
00:27:31.280 --> 00:27:37.440
Then I said: "This costs 5,000 per semester. Help to lift!"
