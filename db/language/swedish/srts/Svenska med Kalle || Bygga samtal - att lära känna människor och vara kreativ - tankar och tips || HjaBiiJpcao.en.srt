00:00:00,815 --> 00:00:01,815
Hello

2
00:00:02,215 --> 00:00:04,745
In this movie I will

3
00:00:04,745 --> 00:00:07,845
Talk about building calls

4
00:00:08,315 --> 00:00:11,315
a thought I have, a suggestion or

5
00:00:11,315 --> 00:00:14,535
An idea I would like to discuss

6
00:00:14,535 --> 00:00:17,965
so this movie gets a little more philosophical

7
00:00:18,305 --> 00:00:21,305
If you want to listen to it

8
00:00:21,305 --> 00:00:24,105
So turn on the subtitles on your mobile or your computer

9
00:00:24,105 --> 00:00:26,835
so that you can listen and read at the same time

10
00:00:26,835 --> 00:00:30,085
Because then it becomes easier to understand

11
00:00:31,055 --> 00:00:34,335
so build calls, hm

12
00:00:34,795 --> 00:00:37,075
We often talk about that

13
00:00:37,075 --> 00:00:39,585
Build sentences

14
00:00:39,585 --> 00:00:42,065
So when you put together several words into a sentence

15
00:00:42,065 --> 00:00:44,675
Then you build a sentence

16
00:00:44,675 --> 00:00:47,135
We can talk about building texts when we put together

17
00:00:47,135 --> 00:00:50,065
several sentences to pieces and several pieces to

18
00:00:50,065 --> 00:00:53,075
a text, we can talk about

19
00:00:53,075 --> 00:00:55,475
To build up our vocabulary

20
00:00:55,475 --> 00:00:58,505
and we can talk, maybe, about building words when we write letters

21
00:00:58,505 --> 00:01:01,525
I don't know, we use building as a

22
00:01:01,525 --> 00:01:03,815
metaphor for many different things

23
00:01:04,265 --> 00:01:07,155
We can build up our confidence

24
00:01:07,155 --> 00:01:10,405
and we can build up a community

25
00:01:10,715 --> 00:01:13,985
so we build many different things and

26
00:01:14,755 --> 00:01:17,495
I think quite often

27
00:01:17,575 --> 00:01:19,945
calls that I have with

28
00:01:19,945 --> 00:01:22,925
one person or more persons

29
00:01:22,925 --> 00:01:26,035
over time, ie a conversation, a discussion

30
00:01:26,035 --> 00:01:29,435
a thought exchange, an exchange of meaning

31
00:01:29,435 --> 00:01:32,545
over time

32
00:01:32,545 --> 00:01:35,485
not just once but several times

33
00:01:35,685 --> 00:01:38,845
I think about it as building up a

34
00:01:38,845 --> 00:01:39,845
Call

35
00:01:41,305 --> 00:01:44,285
and I think this might be a thought

36
00:01:44,285 --> 00:01:47,675
which can also become a tool for you to be

37
00:01:47,675 --> 00:01:50,635
more creative with your own

38
00:01:50,635 --> 00:01:51,705
Language training

39
00:01:52,315 --> 00:01:55,355
for you may have

40
00:01:55,355 --> 00:01:58,085
Places online, you have people

41
00:01:58,085 --> 00:02:01,375
around you at your school, at your job

42
00:02:01,545 --> 00:02:04,415
at your language cafÃ©

43
00:02:04,415 --> 00:02:07,405
The librarian you meet every week

44
00:02:07,405 --> 00:02:10,795
There may be different people or places

45
00:02:10,795 --> 00:02:13,115
maybe a Facebook group or this one

46
00:02:13,115 --> 00:02:16,075
Youtube channel if you usually comment here

47
00:02:16,665 --> 00:02:19,705
where you, so to speak, have the opportunity to little

48
00:02:19,705 --> 00:02:22,525
step by step but still strategically

49
00:02:22,525 --> 00:02:25,535
build one

50
00:02:25,535 --> 00:02:26,535
Call

51
00:02:27,465 --> 00:02:30,405
and it's all about

52
00:02:30,405 --> 00:02:33,385
along with another person or several people

53
00:02:33,385 --> 00:02:35,775
I can say with another human being because

54
00:02:35,775 --> 00:02:38,795
make it a little easier, that together with another

55
00:02:38,795 --> 00:02:41,905
human being building up common references

56
00:02:41,905 --> 00:02:44,765
build

57
00:02:44,765 --> 00:02:47,685
things you both understand

58
00:02:47,685 --> 00:02:50,855
things you've been talking about

59
00:02:50,855 --> 00:02:52,875
and as you return *to *

60
00:02:53,205 --> 00:02:56,145
to, you will return to so that

61
00:02:56,145 --> 00:02:59,215
You understand a little what I mean by some things

62
00:02:59,215 --> 00:03:02,175
I understand how you think, it can be about

63
00:03:02,175 --> 00:03:04,515
things where we know we agree

64
00:03:04,515 --> 00:03:07,425
It may be about things where we know we don't

65
00:03:07,425 --> 00:03:08,445
agree

66
00:03:09,015 --> 00:03:12,135
It may be about me

67
00:03:12,135 --> 00:03:14,455
know your interests

68
00:03:14,455 --> 00:03:17,885
and you know my interests so that

69
00:03:18,405 --> 00:03:20,625
we can in that way can

70
00:03:20,625 --> 00:03:23,335
navigate in a discussion and use it

71
00:03:23,335 --> 00:03:26,295
knowledge we have about each other

72
00:03:26,295 --> 00:03:29,155
In order to make the call more

73
00:03:29,155 --> 00:03:31,865
interesting and deepen the call

74
00:03:31,865 --> 00:03:34,845
and put in new

75
00:03:34,845 --> 00:03:37,985
ideas and new thoughts that we know will

76
00:03:38,085 --> 00:03:40,725
bear fruit, as we know

77
00:03:40,725 --> 00:03:43,665
will give results, which will lead on

78
00:03:43,865 --> 00:03:45,955
that will make us get

79
00:03:46,485 --> 00:03:49,245
new interesting things to talk about

80
00:03:49,735 --> 00:03:50,735
so that

81
00:03:51,780 --> 00:03:54,380
with some persons not happening this

82
00:03:54,520 --> 00:03:55,895
for various reasons

83
00:03:55,895 --> 00:03:58,875
You may, like, discuss a little on the surface

84
00:03:58,880 --> 00:04:02,160
you cold talk, you switch some words

85
00:04:02,440 --> 00:04:05,535
about weather and wind, and the family and what you did yesterday

86
00:04:05,535 --> 00:04:08,255
and what to do on holiday

87
00:04:08,255 --> 00:04:09,915
But it will not be going on

88
00:04:10,405 --> 00:04:13,415
But with other people it becomes natural

89
00:04:13,415 --> 00:04:14,415
so

90
00:04:14,705 --> 00:04:17,055
that the conversation is deepened

91
00:04:17,055 --> 00:04:20,115
so that you get to know more about the other person and so on

92
00:04:20,385 --> 00:04:23,725
But I think this is something you can do

93
00:04:23,725 --> 00:04:24,725
actively

94
00:04:24,925 --> 00:04:27,625
When you notice that another person

95
00:04:27,875 --> 00:04:30,615
have something in common with you or you

96
00:04:30,615 --> 00:04:32,355
becomes curious about another person

97
00:04:32,725 --> 00:04:33,725
so

98
00:04:34,065 --> 00:04:37,035
Begin as well as note

99
00:04:37,035 --> 00:04:39,285
What does this person like to talk about

100
00:04:39,285 --> 00:04:42,165
what is he or she interested in

101
00:04:42,165 --> 00:04:45,335
where could we build a contact and make

102
00:04:45,335 --> 00:04:46,565
A contact stronger

103
00:04:47,315 --> 00:04:48,315
ehm

104
00:04:48,605 --> 00:04:51,455
I feel that this happens quite often

105
00:04:51,455 --> 00:04:54,695
in different ways with people around me

106
00:04:55,195 --> 00:04:58,125
It may be that I notice that a colleague

107
00:04:58,125 --> 00:05:01,205
enjoy talking about books, yes then it becomes like a thing

108
00:05:01,205 --> 00:05:04,025
We will return to, I try to remember

109
00:05:04,025 --> 00:05:06,555
What the colleague said last, what books

110
00:05:06,555 --> 00:05:09,425
We have talked about, what associations

111
00:05:09,425 --> 00:05:11,905
We have done around this

112
00:05:12,135 --> 00:05:14,675
It can be music of course because I

113
00:05:14,675 --> 00:05:18,025
always so interested in music but it may

114
00:05:18,095 --> 00:05:21,275
deal with language with another person maybe

115
00:05:21,405 --> 00:05:24,625
that there is someone that I come back

116
00:05:24,805 --> 00:05:28,235
to talk about language and how to learn language

117
00:05:28,965 --> 00:05:32,035
I hear my colleagues talk about

118
00:05:32,035 --> 00:05:34,445
Football, that's their way of making contact

119
00:05:35,725 --> 00:05:38,425
but that in some way

120
00:05:39,325 --> 00:05:41,395
Using this metaphor

121
00:05:41,725 --> 00:05:44,775
to try to add something

122
00:05:44,775 --> 00:05:47,645
do something more vibrant or more

123
00:05:47,645 --> 00:05:50,485
complex or more developed

124
00:05:50,485 --> 00:05:52,105
or more in -depth

125
00:05:52,425 --> 00:05:54,905
In order to receive the call

126
00:05:54,905 --> 00:05:56,345
more interesting

127
00:05:57,165 --> 00:05:59,945
and then one must

128
00:05:59,945 --> 00:06:03,315
use their curiosity and both in some way

129
00:06:03,335 --> 00:06:06,405
show what one yourself likes

130
00:06:06,405 --> 00:06:09,535
and what one thinks and thinks

131
00:06:09,535 --> 00:06:12,405
you have to give it out but you have to be receptive too

132
00:06:12,405 --> 00:06:15,275
You have to listen

133
00:06:15,275 --> 00:06:17,555
on what the other gives for signals

134
00:06:17,765 --> 00:06:20,445
what he or she tells about or shows

135
00:06:20,445 --> 00:06:21,595
and so on

136
00:06:21,955 --> 00:06:23,275
and

137
00:06:25,005 --> 00:06:27,955
this with getting opportunities

138
00:06:27,955 --> 00:06:30,885
Talking a language is also

139
00:06:30,885 --> 00:06:34,045
a creative action and it's not easy at the beginning

140
00:06:34,045 --> 00:06:36,735
You know that I know it's not easy

141
00:06:37,075 --> 00:06:38,075
but

142
00:06:38,245 --> 00:06:41,235
Still you always have the opportunity to

143
00:06:41,245 --> 00:06:42,685
try as well

144
00:06:43,025 --> 00:06:45,825
give something into a relationship

145
00:06:45,945 --> 00:06:49,035
into a contact, show something

146
00:06:49,035 --> 00:06:51,995
tell me something, dare to be personal

147
00:06:51,995 --> 00:06:54,895
with the linguistic and

148
00:06:54,895 --> 00:06:57,275
communicative tools you have

149
00:06:58,015 --> 00:07:00,085
and in that way

150
00:07:00,875 --> 00:07:03,605
So to say, develop and fortify

151
00:07:03,605 --> 00:07:04,725
a contact

152
00:07:05,255 --> 00:07:06,195
and

153
00:07:06,195 --> 00:07:09,225
There is something there

154
00:07:09,225 --> 00:07:11,785
There is a possibility, there is a scope for action

155
00:07:11,785 --> 00:07:13,875
where you can create it yourself

156
00:07:14,595 --> 00:07:17,705
by going a little beyond

157
00:07:17,705 --> 00:07:21,005
the most superficial, the most common

158
00:07:21,005 --> 00:07:23,425
the most predictable and obvious

159
00:07:23,985 --> 00:07:26,885
When you comment on this movie

160
00:07:26,885 --> 00:07:29,635
When you make a post in a Facebook group

161
00:07:30,185 --> 00:07:33,245
When you tell you something in class

162
00:07:33,245 --> 00:07:36,235
When you sit in the pocket

163
00:07:36,495 --> 00:07:39,115
at your job or your school

164
00:07:39,685 --> 00:07:42,765
so think about how you could give

165
00:07:42,765 --> 00:07:45,855
something more personal, something more

166
00:07:45,855 --> 00:07:48,655
not so expected and predictable

167
00:07:48,805 --> 00:07:50,715
Without something that can

168
00:07:51,895 --> 00:07:55,195
awaken new thoughts, new ideas

169
00:07:55,815 --> 00:07:57,925
In a conversation with another person

170
00:07:58,655 --> 00:08:01,475
I think there is a lot

171
00:08:01,475 --> 00:08:04,495
exciting to explore here, very interesting

172
00:08:04,495 --> 00:08:07,495
to think about and I think a lot

173
00:08:07,495 --> 00:08:09,735
That's probably what I hope for with my videos

174
00:08:09,735 --> 00:08:12,575
and my blog posts and my instagram posts

175
00:08:12,575 --> 00:08:15,165
really I want to

176
00:08:15,165 --> 00:08:18,175
try to build different calls

177
00:08:18,175 --> 00:08:21,115
build a discussion with those who follow me

178
00:08:21,475 --> 00:08:22,475
oh

179
00:08:22,685 --> 00:08:25,105
around language, around culture

180
00:08:25,105 --> 00:08:26,205
around life

181
00:08:26,545 --> 00:08:27,655
Uhm

182
00:08:29,565 --> 00:08:31,315
just

183
00:08:31,915 --> 00:08:34,395
it really is

184
00:08:34,395 --> 00:08:37,045
As is the very goal of communication

185
00:08:37,185 --> 00:08:39,965
is to build understanding and contact

186
00:08:40,145 --> 00:08:42,255
It's a kind of play or

187
00:08:42,255 --> 00:08:45,275
a kind of game with those

188
00:08:45,275 --> 00:08:48,645
Social and communicative

189
00:08:49,265 --> 00:08:52,225
skills and tools we have somehow

190
00:08:52,305 --> 00:08:55,445
To create more

191
00:08:55,445 --> 00:08:57,505
interesting calls and more

192
00:08:57,505 --> 00:08:59,625
more interesting relationships in that way

193
00:09:00,585 --> 00:09:03,175
So think a little about this

194
00:09:03,175 --> 00:09:04,945
How can you get a little more creative

195
00:09:05,395 --> 00:09:08,525
in your communicating, in your

196
00:09:08,725 --> 00:09:10,585
Construction of calls

197
00:09:11,175 --> 00:09:14,045
Also when training Swedish

198
00:09:14,045 --> 00:09:16,155
But of course even in your native language you can think about this

199
00:09:16,965 --> 00:09:20,135
and please comment on this

200
00:09:20,175 --> 00:09:23,085
This was really an invitation to a call

201
00:09:23,085 --> 00:09:24,085
so that

202
00:09:24,375 --> 00:09:27,505
You are welcome to build on my thoughts

203
00:09:27,505 --> 00:09:30,405
or say against or whatever you want to do

204
00:09:30,405 --> 00:09:33,505
that said, please comment, or ask if it was something that was difficult

205
00:09:33,505 --> 00:09:34,765
but

206
00:09:35,345 --> 00:09:38,065
I think it's a nice metaphor

207
00:09:38,065 --> 00:09:39,855
to build calls

208
00:09:40,125 --> 00:09:41,605
Talk to you soon

209
00:09:42,095 --> 00:09:44,945
have it so good so long, hello hello
