1
00:00:46.240 --> 00:00:50.040
I have a time machine.

2
00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:01.200
No, it's a regular box.
 I'm just kidding.

3
00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:59.600
I was in Skåne this weekend and ran on your dad.

4
00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:03.960
He asked me to bring a thing to you.

5
00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:09.320
- This clock.
 - It's his old one.

6
00:02:09.480 --> 00:02:15.840
Your grandfather gave it to your dad and now your father gives it to you.

7
00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:23.760
Be very scared about it.
 I had to go through a lot when I brought it here

8
00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:29.440
I've had it in my tail all the trip up here.

9
00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:33.600
- In the butt?
 -Exactly.
 In the butt.

10
00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:36.840
Why?

11
00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:42.000
I had lots to wear and my pockets were full.

12
00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:49.760
Our Lord gave us a natural pocket.
 Here is the clock - from father to you.

13
00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:57.800
Hello, yes.
 It was Gun.

14
00:02:57.960 --> 00:03:04.240
Gun from Gran Canaria, yes.
 You have come home now.

15
00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:06.920
Yes...

16
00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:14.840
I stand here on the balcony with two newly mixed groggers.

17
00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:22.680
So I came to think of you and unless you would come over ...

18
00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:25.800
Huh?

19
00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:30.160
You're going to try again?
 Yes...

20
00:03:30.320 --> 00:03:34.280
No!
 No danger!

21
00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:41.120
It was just on holiday, yes.
 No, no problems.
 Hello...

22
00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:54.840
Hello, it was Gun again.

23
00:03:55.000 --> 00:04:01.000
The bottle of Malibu that we would share, should you pick up your half?

24
00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:05.760
Oh really?
 Then I thank you for that.
 Hello...

25
00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:12.400
What are you looking at?
 Have you never seen a puma on a balcony?!

26
00:04:19.360 --> 00:04:27.320
- I do not believe in.
 -I do!
 Vacuum cleaner...

27
00:04:33.480 --> 00:04:37.160
You didn't think this.

28
00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:42.760
- I am not a speaker ... - what fun!
 A speech!

29
00:04:42.920 --> 00:04:48.360
I was going to say some well -chosen words to the host couple.

30
00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:54.920
-How fun!
 - I have written a small cheat.

31
00:05:01.640 --> 00:05:06.680
K ... k ... ä ... r ... a ... a ...

32
00:05:06.840 --> 00:05:12.080
... VVV ... friend ... down ...

33
00:05:13.200 --> 00:05:21.840
... viii ... h ... is ... kkkän ...

34
00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:26.160
...each other...

35
00:05:27.240 --> 00:05:33.160
...for several years!

36
00:05:34.200 --> 00:05:38.600
We have known each other for several years.

37
00:05:52.200 --> 00:05:57.920
-This is how it looks.
 - But God what a nice thing!

38
00:05:58.080 --> 00:06:02.480
Great!
 This fits milkshake perfectly.

39
00:06:02.640 --> 00:06:05.640
It was in high school.

40
00:06:05.800 --> 00:06:11.400
Great fun that you called, but what do we do here?

41
00:06:11.560 --> 00:06:15.400
We should go out.
 I have acquired a babysitter.

42
00:06:15.560 --> 00:06:18.560
I'll tell you why I called.

43
00:06:18.720 --> 00:06:23.520
I have felt that Milkshake was never divided.

44
00:06:23.680 --> 00:06:29.200
- We were the school's best dance group.
 -Yes!
 And we were good!

45
00:06:29.360 --> 00:06:32.960
What memories!
 Okay, girls ...

46
00:06:34.960 --> 00:06:37.960
Come on, girls!

47
00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:52.960
 Oh, the night is my world

48
00:06:53.120 --> 00:06:57.280
 City Lights Painted Girl

49
00:06:57.440 --> 00:07:01.440
 In the day nothing matters

50
00:07:01.600 --> 00:07:05.960
 It's the Night Time That Flatters

51
00:07:07.840 --> 00:07:13.680
You remember the choreography!
 It really sits!

52
00:07:13.840 --> 00:07:17.040
We have to start again.

53
00:07:17.200 --> 00:07:23.200
I'll be coming soon.
 I'll just lock after the dancers.

54
00:07:23.360 --> 00:07:27.120
No no.
 These are old lovers.

55
00:07:38.400 --> 00:07:46.360
- Do you often storage stuff in the back?
 –Oft and often ...

56
00:07:46.520 --> 00:07:52.520
In the summer when you only have shorts and t -shirts -

57
00:07:52.680 --> 00:07:59.720
- Is it a practical place to have small money, tulo, something to read ...

58
00:07:59.880 --> 00:08:03.080
- Do you have anything there now?
 -No.

59
00:08:03.240 --> 00:08:09.240
Well, the front of the car stereo.
 They are so theft -proof.

60
00:08:28.560 --> 00:08:35.360
- Jesper, what are you doing in there?
 -Nothing.
 Leave me alone.

61
00:08:35.520 --> 00:08:40.920
- What you do is unnatural.
 -Leave me alone!

62
00:08:46.080 --> 00:08:49.160
I am who I am.

63
00:09:46.400 --> 00:09:52.560
Hello.
 It's Gun again.
 You shouldn't take and come anyway?

64
00:09:52.720 --> 00:09:58.720
I only have little leopard on me so I can be your kiss cat.

65
00:09:58.880 --> 00:10:03.200
I can be a lion.
 Can I do!

66
00:10:03.360 --> 00:10:10.680
I have bedded with the Hawaii sheet, and there is grogg and wood.

67
00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:18.640
I stand here on the balcony and it is full of men who look at me.

68
00:10:18.800 --> 00:10:24.120
Yes, it is.
 One is looking at me now ...!

69
00:10:24.280 --> 00:10:26.920
Hello?

70
00:10:47.600 --> 00:10:54.000
"He came as a storm in April with a Höganäskrus on his neck ..."

71
00:10:54.160 --> 00:10:59.760
We all recognize the introduction to August Strindberg's "Hemsöborna".

72
00:10:59.920 --> 00:11:05.920
Strindberg starts in the middle of the events, so -called.
 In media resume ...

73
00:11:06.080 --> 00:11:09.080
... as I did now.

74
00:11:09.240 --> 00:11:14.840
Hello!
 My name is Gunnar.
 Welcome to this printer course.

75
00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:20.800
Before the course you have all been given the task of bringing a text with you.

76
00:11:20.960 --> 00:11:27.200
We throw ourselves straight in and see where we end up.
 Read for us!

77
00:11:27.360 --> 00:11:33.360
- I have used well -known characters.
 -Good!
 Identification...

78
00:11:33.520 --> 00:11:38.920
"Ally McBeal entered the lawyer - the office. She was stressed and tired."

79
00:11:39.080 --> 00:11:44.080
"It was full of people in the office and Richard wasn't happy."

80
00:11:44.240 --> 00:11:49.440
We're holding there.
 Another example of in the media res.

81
00:11:49.600 --> 00:11:53.000
-What's your name?
 - Gunilla.

82
00:11:53.160 --> 00:12:00.160
I haven't written anything, but I have a character that I work with.

83
00:12:00.320 --> 00:12:07.320
It is a young woman, or a girl, who lives alone in a large villa.

84
00:12:07.480 --> 00:12:14.640
- She's a strong girl.
 -Good.
 Strong women are interesting.

85
00:12:14.800 --> 00:12:21.040
She is very strong.
 She can lift a car with her bare hands.

86
00:12:21.200 --> 00:12:25.360
She has a different lifestyle.

87
00:12:25.520 --> 00:12:29.680
Her pet is a horse and a monkey.

88
00:12:29.840 --> 00:12:36.160
Her only real friends are neighboring children, Tommy and Annika.

89
00:12:36.320 --> 00:12:43.360
We recognize that a bit.
 It is largely Pippi Longstocking.

90
00:12:43.520 --> 00:12:51.480
A little, but it's such a popular figure that you can write more about her.

91
00:12:51.640 --> 00:12:57.240
But as Astrid Lindgren has already written about her ...

92
00:12:57.400 --> 00:13:02.000
It can be difficult to follow in Lindgren's footsteps.

93
00:13:02.160 --> 00:13:08.960
- She should have received the Nobel Prize.
 -Absolutely.
 Many people think ...

94
00:13:09.120 --> 00:13:15.120
It is not easy to come up with a look.
 Should we check some topics?

95
00:13:15.280 --> 00:13:19.920
Just shout out, and I write on the board.

96
00:13:21.400 --> 00:13:28.680
I write "love".
 It is a popular subject in literature.

97
00:13:28.840 --> 00:13:32.840
- What more do we have?
 -Love!

98
00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:36.000
Falls a little under love.

99
00:13:36.160 --> 00:13:42.400
- boxes!
 - Absolutely ... what's in the box?

100
00:13:42.560 --> 00:13:46.240
Very exciting ... more!

101
00:13:46.400 --> 00:13:49.400
Fish!

102
00:13:51.800 --> 00:13:55.600
- Pike!
 -Paris.

103
00:13:55.760 --> 00:13:59.560
-Ferris wheel.
 -Cod.

104
00:13:59.720 --> 00:14:06.120
Thanks.
 Now we have three words on the board - love, boxes and fish.

105
00:14:06.280 --> 00:14:09.600
There are three words.

106
00:14:26.480 --> 00:14:31.480
- I have fixed a show.
 -Already!
 Where?

107
00:14:31.640 --> 00:14:35.960
- Strorget's day.
 -God how fun!

108
00:14:36.120 --> 00:14:39.120
Here we go!

109
00:15:08.800 --> 00:15:12.000
This doesn't work.

110
00:15:12.160 --> 00:15:20.040
We are good, but we have to be the best and then you have to train, work out!

111
00:15:20.200 --> 00:15:26.640
Right here we have to start paying with ... we have to pay with ...

112
00:15:26.800 --> 00:15:31.600
- What do we have to pay for?
 - Cramp, cramp!

113
00:15:34.200 --> 00:15:40.840
Fy fuck ... now you have to get out of here.
 Now the brides will drive.

114
00:15:47.600 --> 00:15:53.880
- Then the canned goods are inside, then.
 - Set up here and we'll have a snack.

115
00:15:54.040 --> 00:15:59.040
Before we have a snack, I would say some well -chosen words.

116
00:16:00.600 --> 00:16:08.560
Jeanette, you have now moved from your childhood home in the polkagris city Gränna.

117
00:16:08.720 --> 00:16:13.720
Mom and I think it's empty, so empty.

118
00:16:13.880 --> 00:16:19.680
But we have known that this day when you flee the nest would come.

119
00:16:19.840 --> 00:16:24.480
Now I want to give a gift on the journey.

120
00:16:24.640 --> 00:16:31.800
As proud father and owner of the Polkagrisfabriken Grisfabriken -

121
00:16:31.960 --> 00:16:39.120
- Want to give you a go'er rod to suck on when the homesickness gets too difficult.

122
00:16:41.280 --> 00:16:46.120
It's a new taste for the season.

123
00:16:46.280 --> 00:16:53.320
Already today, you should, dottra mi, suck you measured on this good rod ...

124
00:16:56.720 --> 00:17:02.360
... and think about mom and dad every time you suck.

125
00:17:02.520 --> 00:17:08.320
Mom should have a go's rod to suck on too.

126
00:17:11.320 --> 00:17:17.920
Is there anything good than hearing dottra and mom suck?

127
00:17:26.680 --> 00:17:33.160
Out to the paintball track, super him full, puts on him rabbit heat ...

128
00:17:33.320 --> 00:17:37.920
... and chases that bastard like a hare through the forest.

129
00:17:38.080 --> 00:17:45.640
Pepper the ass with color balls, film it, and send to his girlfriend!

130
00:17:48.240 --> 00:17:56.000
- Didn't we do it with Håkan?
 - Yes ... we have to come up with something new.

131
00:17:57.520 --> 00:18:01.520
We take the Finnish ferry, full as eggs ...

132
00:18:01.680 --> 00:18:07.280
Then he is allowed to sit in the whirlpool with a bunch of strippers -

133
00:18:07.440 --> 00:18:12.000
- And we have put laxatives in his drink!

134
00:18:12.160 --> 00:18:17.800
And then we film it and send to his mother -in -law.

135
00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:26.640
It's great fun with these burlesque, popular procession.

136
00:18:26.800 --> 00:18:30.480
I have my own proposal.

137
00:18:30.640 --> 00:18:37.240
They have a fantastic exhibition at Liljevalchs with a pour painting.

138
00:18:37.400 --> 00:18:43.440
Why not let him decorate his own bridal chest?

139
00:18:43.600 --> 00:18:51.240
Instead of ordinary glue colors, we give him a water -based color -

140
00:18:51.400 --> 00:18:56.520
- So his painting becomes much paler.

141
00:19:05.720 --> 00:19:08.720
Hello, it was Gun again.

142
00:19:08.880 --> 00:19:14.080
Now you stop fitting and coming to me!

143
00:19:14.240 --> 00:19:18.200
Stop getting you and come!

144
00:19:18.360 --> 00:19:23.520
What then, old girl?
 You are not so young yourself.

145
00:19:23.680 --> 00:19:27.280
Shit in it then if it doesn't fit!

146
00:19:27.440 --> 00:19:35.400
I can go down to the pub and get whatever man I want.
 Can I do!

147
00:19:35.560 --> 00:19:41.360
No!
 You don't have to wish me good luck.
 Hello!

148
00:19:47.200 --> 00:19:50.920
Hello, it was Gun.

149
00:19:51.080 --> 00:19:55.560
Gun that you met in Båstad, yes ...

150
00:19:55.720 --> 00:20:03.000
I stand here on the balcony with two newly mixed groggers ...

151
00:20:06.320 --> 00:20:14.080
Okay, how many have read something by Nobel Laureate Imre Kertész?

152
00:20:15.240 --> 00:20:17.240
No?
 No.

153
00:20:17.400 --> 00:20:23.400
He has a great way to paint pictures with words.

154
00:20:23.560 --> 00:20:26.800
Read for us.

155
00:20:32.040 --> 00:20:36.040
VVV ... in ...

156
00:20:36.200 --> 00:20:40.800
... hh ... a ... they ...

157
00:20:40.960 --> 00:20:45.960
... VVV ... than ... tat ...

158
00:20:46.800 --> 00:20:50.600
-... Locate ... ne ... - long.

159
00:20:52.600 --> 00:20:55.600
Do you remember Salle?

160
00:20:55.760 --> 00:21:03.440
Who was a teacher at TBV, who was in Fame, which all girls were crazy in!

161
00:21:03.600 --> 00:21:10.000
- There is an old man behind the palm!
 - How did you see me?
 I played leaves.

162
00:21:10.160 --> 00:21:15.560
- Get I present Salle!
 - Is that Salle ...?!

163
00:21:15.720 --> 00:21:19.240
Girls, we're running!

164
00:21:41.360 --> 00:21:46.760
- What good we are!
 - Fan, how tired I am.

165
00:21:46.920 --> 00:21:52.320
Keep the fine feeling.
 It's time for the next step.

166
00:21:52.480 --> 00:21:56.440
- A cig?
 -Easy.

167
00:21:58.000 --> 00:22:03.840
Keep the feeling now, we drive!
 - Thanks, Salle!

168
00:22:26.320 --> 00:22:30.400
It wasn't me who shot Palme, you.

169
00:22:37.800 --> 00:22:41.560
Jjj ... a ... g ...

173
00:22:57.040 --> 00:23:00.080
I'll give three examples!

174
00:23:00.240 --> 00:23:03.920
... one ... example one!

175
00:23:44.800 --> 00:23:48.800
Excuse me, this feels a little flimsy.

176
00:23:48.960 --> 00:23:54.200
Can't we learn how to actually write?

177
00:23:54.360 --> 00:23:57.360
You probably have to develop that a little ...

178
00:23:57.520 --> 00:24:01.040
How to form words?

179
00:24:01.200 --> 00:24:06.480
All letters, how do you use them?

180
00:24:06.640 --> 00:24:13.640
Okay ... how many in here feel safe on the alphabet?

181
00:24:31.680 --> 00:24:38.520
It is important to find positive energy even when life is bath.

182
00:24:38.680 --> 00:24:44.560
Positive Thinking Will Always Help You Navigate Your Inner Landscape.

183
00:24:44.720 --> 00:24:49.120
Have you Experienced Negative Energy?

184
00:24:49.280 --> 00:24:51.760
Yes.

185
00:24:51.920 --> 00:24:58.200
One of the Toughest Moments was when my brother got very sick.

186
00:24:58.360 --> 00:25:04.840
--That must be negative.
 –VERY worried, very very worried.

187
00:25:08.200 --> 00:25:12.200
It was a painful time for the whole family.

188
00:25:12.360 --> 00:25:15.440
A Couple of Weeks Later ...

189
00:25:15.600 --> 00:25:19.640
... he died from his disease.

190
00:25:21.000 --> 00:25:26.720
Sorry ... that must be negative.

191
00:25:28.960 --> 00:25:33.200
Two Weeks Later ...

192
00:25:33.360 --> 00:25:36.640
... My Mother Died Too.

193
00:25:36.800 --> 00:25:40.480
That is also negative.

194
00:25:40.640 --> 00:25:44.120
It was a hard time.

195
00:25:44.280 --> 00:25:50.640
–We cried a lot.
 -You cried a lot!
 Like ...!

196
00:25:57.760 --> 00:26:04.480
 I WANT TO BE LOVED BY YOU

197
00:26:04.640 --> 00:26:11.520
 Just you, and Nobody else but you

198
00:26:11.680 --> 00:26:17.480
 I WANT TO BE LOVED BY YOU

199
00:26:17.640 --> 00:26:22.480
 ... Alone!
 Boop - Oop - a -doop

200
00:26:22.640 --> 00:26:29.560
Well, shit in it then!
 Fucking eyeglasses ...

201
00:26:29.720 --> 00:26:35.160
But you, you miss the pussy's Rolls Royce.

202
00:26:48.520 --> 00:26:55.040
Hello!
 We have gone away.
 Do you know where the station is?

203
00:26:55.200 --> 00:27:01.200
Keep shaving the road here, and to the right at the houses over there.

204
00:27:01.360 --> 00:27:06.360
Thanks.
 We are newly moved and do not find so good.

205
00:27:06.520 --> 00:27:13.200
Moving to a new city can be likened to anal sex.

206
00:27:13.360 --> 00:27:20.320
It is slow at first, but with a little effort you will fit in soon.

207
00:27:35.800 --> 00:27:39.160
A tulo?

208
00:27:39.320 --> 00:27:42.320
No thanks.

209
00:28:09.840 --> 00:28:11.840

00:28:21.600 --> 00:28:26.600
