1
00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:59.560
- Disc: Still night ... –Stilla night!

2
00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:03.400
Holy night!

3
00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:06.040
Everything ... everything ...

4
00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:10.240
- Disc: Everything is peace ... - Everything is peace!

5
00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:13.800
Star Blid

6
00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:19.360
Shines on children ... on children ... - Hello, honey.
 Are you up?

7
00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:25.960
- I thought you would be able to sleep out.
 - Of some reason I woke up ...

8
00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:31.320
- I am false?
 - Not worse than usual.
 Merry Christmas!

9
00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:36.960
- The breakfast is just finished.
 - Lovely.
 How nice you dressed the Christmas tree!

10
00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:39.840
Thank you...

11
00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:45.240
Today I have made a very important decision:

12
00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:51.960
- This Christmas we should be kind.
 - I might be hoping for the dress?

13
00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:59.320
-Yes.
 It is in the big red package.
 - No, you shouldn't tell you!

14
00:01:59.480 --> 00:02:04.200
Sorry.
 We give it to the max instead ...

15
00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:11.000
/ Doorbell/ Who bothers this time on Christmas Eve?

16
00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:17.600
If it is pensioners who sell cookies, so buy no more.
 They taste chlorine.

17
00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:24.720
- It was from Edlund's electric!
 - Thanks, Merry Christmas!

18
00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:31.000
It must be over with bribes!
 How many cartons have you received now?

19
00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:35.560
–22 with that one.
 --Able dark chocolate and marzipan ...

20
00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:42.320
- Where are the foam plots you used to get?
 - They got when you sat at the checkout.

21
00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:48.760
- You would never have become a manager!
 -You're just jealous.

22
00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:53.800
You, the day before yesterday, the boss offered a brach lunch!

23
00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:58.440
- A lice cat and a glass of O'boy ... - Yes, yes ...

24
00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:03.400
But it was a nice atmosphere!

25
00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:08.600
It is the first Christmas in eight years -

26
00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:13.240
- As we don't have to smile at unknown people.

27
00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:18.520
It's actually your relatives.
 But you are right.

28
00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:25.440
It feels good.
 Just you and I ... and the kids.

29
00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:30.720
Hi, my winter country, now I'm here!

30
00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:33.640
Merry Christmas!

31
00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:39.600
How wonderful to celebrate Christmas with you!
 Sure it doesn't do anything?

32
00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:45.080
Of course you should celebrate with us!
 You are part of our family.

33
00:03:45.240 --> 00:03:51.560
- You would be to Lanzarote?
 - I know, but I couldn't afford it.

34
00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:56.840
- Yes, it's only Christmas once a year.
 -How nice of you!

35
00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:01.640
- What does a air ticket cost?
 - Gustav ...

36
00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:10.240
You're glad I'm here!
 You have always enjoyed my company.

37
00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:15.880
Of course, Sara.
 Sell your house and move in to us!

38
00:04:16.040 --> 00:04:19.160
-What time is it?
 - Nine.

39
00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:23.960
-Now Scooby-Doo starts!
 -Why hello there!

40
00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:30.040
- Now you should dance around the Christmas tree.
 - Then put to Lanzarote!

41
00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:34.200
We celebrate a Swedish, old -fashioned Christmas.

42
00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:39.440
- Yes, we watch TV ... –Stilla night ...

43
00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:44.320
Very nice, old man, but hurry up!
 Scooby-doo starts!

44
00:04:44.480 --> 00:04:48.920
Hyvää Päivää!
 Päministeri Ingvar Carlsson ...

45
00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:54.160
- Hosianna ... - what is this?!

46
00:04:54.320 --> 00:04:59.120
Carols.
 They usually sing at Christmas just ...

47
00:04:59.280 --> 00:05:04.280
And now, all children, what you have been waiting for:

48
00:05:04.440 --> 00:05:11.640
"The plot strut and spinning snail", an award -winning Czech dock.

49
00:05:11.800 --> 00:05:18.320
- Tjeckian doll movie?
 What is this?!
 -Scooby-Doo goes on TV3 this year.

50
00:05:18.480 --> 00:05:20.480
TV3 ...

51
00:05:20.640 --> 00:05:26.840
I never thought so!
 Some do everything for money.
 It betrayed dog!

52
00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:32.800
- Where are you going, Gustav?
 - To Pettersson.
 He has a satellite dish!

53
00:05:49.120 --> 00:05:55.120
- If you take one more, I'll kill you.
 - You should be nice on Christmas Eve!

54
00:05:55.280 --> 00:06:02.360
Then I have killed you in the middle days!
 Help instead.
 Fold napkins.

55
00:06:03.720 --> 00:06:09.480
- When does Lina come?
 - When she sold all the lots.
 Midsummer?

56
00:06:09.640 --> 00:06:14.640
- Line is very capable.
 - It doesn't think our neighbors.

57
00:06:14.800 --> 00:06:20.520
She calls twice about Dan.
 They throw garbage after her.

58
00:06:20.680 --> 00:06:25.800
- Lotteries that are so exciting!
 -Yes you...

59
00:06:25.960 --> 00:06:31.200
- The first price here is a stain.
 - Well ... yeah ...

60
00:06:31.360 --> 00:06:35.960
- Max, have you sold any Christmas magazines?
 -Two.

61
00:06:36.120 --> 00:06:40.120
To Dad.
 Knasen and Buster.

62
00:06:40.280 --> 00:06:46.080
- You Dad always stands up!
 - He hasn't paid yet.

63
00:06:46.240 --> 00:06:50.280
He must first check that they are good.

64
00:06:52.160 --> 00:06:55.480
Who is the culprit?

65
00:06:55.640 --> 00:06:59.400
-What?
 - A crime has been committed.

66
00:06:59.560 --> 00:07:06.040
- Who exhibited him to die in the cold?
 - He would be outdoors this year.

67
00:07:06.200 --> 00:07:09.200
Efraim should be with us!

68
00:07:15.520 --> 00:07:22.160
- Would you like to stand out in the cold?
 - I am not of plaster, Gustav ...

69
00:07:22.320 --> 00:07:27.840
- It's Heidelberg Porcelain!
 - He reminds me of my parents.

70
00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:31.040
Were they dwarfs?

71
00:07:31.200 --> 00:07:37.800
- They also had a figure in the garden.
 - They should stand outdoors, those plots.

72
00:07:37.960 --> 00:07:42.160
It was Hjalmar Branting, Dad's Idol.

73
00:07:42.800 --> 00:07:48.640
We can have Björn Borg here outside with a marshal in our mouths.

74
00:07:48.800 --> 00:07:52.760
I'm not going to say anything nasty back.

75
00:07:52.920 --> 00:07:55.920
Door bell

76
00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:58.520
- It's to me!
 - No more bribes in this house!

77
00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:05.160
- Look, Gustav ... nice, huh?
 - Yes, very nice, Sara!

78
00:08:05.320 --> 00:08:09.240
It is nice that you are here.

79
00:08:09.400 --> 00:08:14.040
I was just so set on a family Christmas ...

80
00:08:14.200 --> 00:08:19.840
- Lena is right.
 You belong to the family.
 -Thanks!
 Do you mean it?

81
00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:23.800
Clear.
 You can vacuum upstairs.

82
00:08:23.960 --> 00:08:27.840
But no more bribes, I said!

83
00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:33.000
It's not a bribe, it's a small clean sausage.

84
00:08:33.160 --> 00:08:38.200
Customers show their estimate.
 - Carry it down in the basement.

85
00:08:38.360 --> 00:08:42.640
A clean sausage?
 If you want to bribe someone, you can take in.

86
00:08:42.800 --> 00:08:49.360
- Bofors did not give reindeer sausage to India!
 - It's fun with good food?

87
00:08:49.520 --> 00:08:56.360
Yes, but the pattern is just so clear.
 Everything is put in systems, all cheating.

88
00:08:56.520 --> 00:09:01.240
The banks utilize small businesses, which use customers ...

89
00:09:01.400 --> 00:09:05.920
Should I roll out the overhead apparatus, Gustav?

90
00:09:06.080 --> 00:09:11.120
I think it's a shame that everything is about money.

91
00:09:11.280 --> 00:09:18.080
- Where are all the honest people?
 - They have probably been purchased by TV3.

92
00:09:18.240 --> 00:09:22.000
- Where is my little friend?!
 -Here!

93
00:09:24.040 --> 00:09:30.040
- I talk about Skåne Akvavit.
 - I haven't bought anyone this year.

94
00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:40.960
- I hope you joke with me.
 - You would buy because I forget.

95
00:09:41.120 --> 00:09:46.640
No, we didn't say.
 I said that soon I have to buy ...

96
00:09:46.800 --> 00:09:52.040
–.. Because you always forget.
 -Take it easy.

97
00:09:52.200 --> 00:09:59.000
- I certainly have something at my house.
 - Choice bark liqueur cuts with the herring.

98
00:09:59.160 --> 00:10:04.120
- You never want to try anything new!
 - Ha, don't say that ...

99
00:10:04.280 --> 00:10:10.400
- This year we have no dip in the pot.
 - There you hear!
 - What did you say?!

100
00:10:10.560 --> 00:10:14.680
But what is it now?
 We decided that.

101
00:10:14.840 --> 00:10:21.720
- No one ate last year!
 - and ate ...!
 It should stand there!

102
00:10:21.880 --> 00:10:27.040
What is going on?
 Shouldn't we celebrate any Christmas?!

103
00:10:27.200 --> 00:10:32.200
Yes, but it does not have to look the same evenly.

104
00:10:32.360 --> 00:10:37.360
That's what is meant by Christmas!

105
00:10:37.520 --> 00:10:44.960
- The only one you know how it will be ... - eight hours of waiting for the packages.

106
00:10:45.120 --> 00:10:49.960
But this year we will have fun together.

107
00:10:50.120 --> 00:10:54.320
-I am home!
 - It burst immediately ...

108
00:10:54.480 --> 00:11:01.200
You know what?
 I have sold twelve lots!
 But there are 31 left.

109
00:11:01.360 --> 00:11:06.920
- I bought 40 and buy no more.
 - You have won!

110
00:11:07.080 --> 00:11:12.160
Ten issues of my horse!
 I don't think it's good!

111
00:11:12.320 --> 00:11:15.960
You should help each other at Christmas.

112
00:11:16.120 --> 00:11:21.040
Lina, do not abuse the Christian message.

113
00:11:21.200 --> 00:11:28.200
Christmas we celebrate in remembrance of Jesus' birth.
 - How the hell do we do with the nub?

114
00:11:29.200 --> 00:11:33.600
Don't you have a bottle of clearasil for dad?

115
00:11:33.760 --> 00:11:39.120
Thanks.
 Extremely funny said ... - Can't we start eating?

116
00:11:39.280 --> 00:11:44.240
- Mina's lots then?
 - I buy one and save Christmas.

117
00:11:48.400 --> 00:11:52.160
Lol!
 I knew it!
 Second prize!

118
00:11:52.320 --> 00:11:57.200
What a Christmas present!
 A car, a TV, a earth trip?

119
00:11:57.360 --> 00:12:01.040
You get a riding lesson.

120
00:12:01.200 --> 00:12:06.560
Congratulations, honey ... Sit you now, so we can start.

121
00:12:07.720 --> 00:12:12.760
What do you want to drink - Christmas must or water?

122
00:12:26.720 --> 00:12:30.720
Christmas last year with mom and dad.

123
00:12:30.880 --> 00:12:34.840
How cozy when the whole family gathers!

124
00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:42.440
Although it is the skull chain.
 We got mulled wine before we went out after Gustav.

125
00:12:42.600 --> 00:12:48.160
- Did he have disappeared?
 - He was looking for the perfect Christmas tree.

126
00:12:48.320 --> 00:12:54.080
- Yes, it can take time ... –Servarly if you look for the calf mountain.

127
00:12:54.240 --> 00:13:00.800
I'm jealous of you and Gustav.
 You have found that magical.

128
00:13:00.960 --> 00:13:07.640
You will be dear all your life.
 Is there any secret, any method?

129
00:13:07.800 --> 00:13:11.760
Yes.
 Close your eyes and think about something else!

130
00:13:17.560 --> 00:13:24.400
-Lena ... what's the best thing about Gustav?
 - Should I be serious?

131
00:13:24.560 --> 00:13:31.840
That I know he loves me and the kids over everything else on earth.

132
00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:39.280
- The kids should give a damn in my snow lantern!
 -Sit down.
 Kalle Duck will start soon.

133
00:13:39.440 --> 00:13:45.280
–Wa?
 - Hurry up!
 Donald Duck!
 - We shit in Kalle Duck!

134
00:13:45.440 --> 00:13:49.760
Come in, otherwise you will not receive any Christmas presents!

135
00:13:52.640 --> 00:14:00.040
- Why can't we record it?
 - It is broadcast once a year - now!

136
00:14:00.160 --> 00:14:05.360
- Can I ask why you bought video?
 - All has video!

137
00:14:05.520 --> 00:14:10.360
Dad doesn't know how it works.
 Sit you now ...

138
00:14:10.520 --> 00:14:16.600
- It's the same movies every year!
 - We should enjoy and recognize us.

139
00:14:16.760 --> 00:14:20.680
The plot's workshop, the bull Ferdinand ...

140
00:14:20.840 --> 00:14:25.600
And you cry when the Cinderella gets his dress!

141
00:14:25.760 --> 00:14:32.440
It's nice that the rats line up for her!
 And so they sing well.

142
00:14:32.600 --> 00:14:34.680
Sch!

143
00:14:34.840 --> 00:14:40.440
Now we visit Kalle Anka and his friends ...

144
00:14:40.600 --> 00:14:45.800
What is the post shot?!
 Where is Arne Weise?

145
00:14:45.960 --> 00:14:52.680
It will not be Christmas unless he sits there in his armchair!
 - Sch!

146
00:15:10.040 --> 00:15:13.640
- Take more porridge!
 -It's disgusting!

147
00:15:13.800 --> 00:15:19.000
Why do you think we eat it only once a year?

148
00:15:23.160 --> 00:15:26.440
At Christmas you should eat porridge!

149
00:15:26.600 --> 00:15:31.520
-What is it?
 - I think about how good you are.

150
00:15:31.680 --> 00:15:38.080
I thought you needed change, but you do the same year in and year in -

151
00:15:38.240 --> 00:15:41.240
–And is really nice.

152
00:15:42.400 --> 00:15:48.240
How boring it sounds!
 - Don't we do the same thing every year?

153
00:15:48.400 --> 00:15:55.240
No.
 - No, there you are wrong, Sara.
 In here, the wind of change is blowing!

154
00:15:55.400 --> 00:16:00.480
Sure!
 This year we had the hammock on the front!

155
00:16:02.080 --> 00:16:05.520
What ... a meatball?!

156
00:16:05.680 --> 00:16:09.160
I found no almonds.

157
00:16:14.480 --> 00:16:18.720
But Hörni, do you think the plot is coming this year?

158
00:16:18.880 --> 00:16:22.920
- We may well ask him ... —Sch!

159
00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:29.360
Gustav, Max stopped believing in the plot at the age of four!

160
00:16:29.520 --> 00:16:36.800
There is a lot we don't understand!
 Ufon, soul migration, plots and trolls ...

161
00:16:36.960 --> 00:16:38.600
Video ...

162
00:16:38.760 --> 00:16:42.960
No ... should we sit down at the Christmas tree?

163
00:16:43.120 --> 00:16:49.960
- It's starting to be time, dad?
 - Crack you warm, it's cold.

164
00:16:50.120 --> 00:16:55.200
-What are you talking about?
 - Here you have a ten to the newspaper.

165
00:17:06.240 --> 00:17:10.240
- Bug right!
 - "Yatzy" it's called!

166
00:17:12.640 --> 00:17:16.720
-Where is he?
 - The magazine might have ended.

167
00:17:16.880 --> 00:17:22.040
- Why should he dress up every year?
 - Set complain now!

168
00:17:22.200 --> 00:17:26.120
You should have a nice childhood to remember.

169
00:17:26.280 --> 00:17:31.920
- Yes, it's too late ... - be kind now, Lina!
 It's Christmas.

170
00:17:32.080 --> 00:17:37.960
-What do you want?
 - A dress - the red package there.

171
00:17:38.120 --> 00:17:44.720
- What takes such time?
 - Should we pull together a skull chain?

172
00:17:42.600 --> 00:17:45.600
Door bell

173
00:17:44.880 --> 00:17:51.200
- Who calls on Christmas Eve?
 --Arne Weise, maybe ...

174
00:17:51.360 --> 00:17:57.960
Now sharpen yourself.
 And look surprised!
 - Oh, the plot!
 Get on, get on!

175
00:17:58.120 --> 00:18:04.360
It took time.
 The reindeer maybe ran past Pettersson and drank mulled wine?

176
00:18:04.520 --> 00:18:11.640
-Are there any nice children here?
 -No.
 Gustav Svensson raised us.

177
00:18:11.800 --> 00:18:18.800
Now I don't understand, my young man.
 Are there any nice children here?!

178
00:18:18.960 --> 00:18:23.120
- See yes now, so we can continue.
 - Yeah.

179
00:18:23.280 --> 00:18:27.440
Then we'll see ... First package ...

180
00:18:27.600 --> 00:18:31.720
Is there anyone named Sara here?

181
00:18:31.880 --> 00:18:35.920
- Here I am, Gustav!
 - "The plot"!

182
00:18:36.920 --> 00:18:43.960
"To a nice and good girl, I'm glad I have you. Lenin."

183
00:18:44.120 --> 00:18:46.360
"Lena" ...

184
00:18:46.520 --> 00:18:50.960
- thank you, the plot ... –Oj, what exciting.

185
00:18:51.120 --> 00:18:56.080
Do you have more packages here?
 Yes, to Lena!

186
00:18:56.240 --> 00:18:59.760
-!
 -Look here...

187
00:18:59.920 --> 00:19:04.920
"When you cook in the oven you burn very often"

188
00:19:05.080 --> 00:19:10.560
"With this one you become a calm one, because it's a pretty good pot"

189
00:19:10.720 --> 00:19:14.520
- Sara's rhyme ... - why are you reading?

190
00:19:14.680 --> 00:19:22.360
It is the one who has bought the gift to read the rhyme.
 In our family ...

191
00:19:22.520 --> 00:19:27.880
-Sara, we shit in your fucking family!
 - Mom, the plot swear.

192
00:19:28.040 --> 00:19:32.080
That little boy is max?

193
00:19:32.240 --> 00:19:38.920
The sneezes have said that if you do not sharpen yourself, you will not receive a Christmas present.

194
00:19:39.080 --> 00:19:44.400
Greet the niches that I have already seen the snowboard.

195
00:19:45.400 --> 00:19:49.240
- Take the next package now.
 -Oh!

196
00:19:49.400 --> 00:19:54.840
To Lina Svensson.
 You wish you a horse, I have heard.

197
00:19:55.000 --> 00:19:59.240
-Right.
 Do you have any in the bag?
 -No...

198
00:19:59.400 --> 00:20:04.760
"No stallion and no mare, but probably a week in Örebro"

199
00:20:04.920 --> 00:20:09.920
- A riding camp!
 Thanks Dad!
 - "The plot," I said!

200
00:20:11.840 --> 00:20:19.000
It's a shame I can't meet your dad ... A nice man, I've heard!

201
00:20:19.160 --> 00:20:25.560
- He struggles in the sweat of his approach ... - He reads the magazine in the garden!

202
00:20:25.720 --> 00:20:32.200
- No, now I have to rush on ... - but I then?

203
00:20:32.360 --> 00:20:38.720
-Yes good bye.
 And good continuation!
 - Good continuation, Santa!

204
00:20:38.880 --> 00:20:45.760
- Then were everyone happy and happy?
 -Not me!
 Where is my snowboard?

205
00:20:45.920 --> 00:20:51.240
You received so many Christmas presents last year.

206
00:20:51.400 --> 00:20:59.040
I forgot about a person.
 Sorry!
 "To Max" ... yeah, he's here.

207
00:21:01.200 --> 00:21:07.640
"When you down the hill flying we hope this day"

208
00:21:07.800 --> 00:21:10.560
You are welcome.

209
00:21:12.200 --> 00:21:16.360
Have a fun, and drive carefully.

210
00:21:16.520 --> 00:21:20.720
- Are you joking?
 -No.
 It was the only thing ...

211
00:21:20.880 --> 00:21:25.920
But I saw some strange plank in the garden ...

212
00:21:26.080 --> 00:21:32.040
-Have!
 I knew it!
 - Jessica will be so jealous!

213
00:21:32.200 --> 00:21:35.320
We spoil the children.

214
00:21:35.480 --> 00:21:39.840
You do it.
 It had been enough with a jojo.

215
00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:42.400
A yeah!

216
00:21:43.400 --> 00:21:49.520
- Didn't you buy the sweater?!
 - A sweater is so boring to get ...

217
00:21:49.680 --> 00:21:55.600
- It's far too much!
 -Not then!
 You should have it!

218
00:21:56.600 --> 00:22:01.640
Dad ... sometimes I actually like you!

219
00:22:01.800 --> 00:22:06.320
Tell it, I pick up the camcorder.

220
00:22:18.760 --> 00:22:24.480
- It was Christmas!
 The years go by so fast.
 - They do it ...

221
00:22:25.560 --> 00:22:30.800
It is only 3,000 years left until the sun explodes.

222
00:22:30.960 --> 00:22:37.640
–3,000 years - that's nothing!
 - You feel almost a little stressed.

223
00:22:37.800 --> 00:22:41.000
Should we take a year before it hits?

224
00:22:41.160 --> 00:22:44.640
When I was little, aunt said:

225
00:22:44.800 --> 00:22:49.920
"Take advantage of every new day as if it were the last!"

226
00:22:50.080 --> 00:22:55.200
- Munert ... Was she a child psychologist?
 - long -term driver driver.

227
00:22:55.360 --> 00:23:01.040
- She drove the family to the airport.
 - What are they doing now?

228
00:23:01.200 --> 00:23:06.040
- Do they smooth in the sun and fry now?
 -No.

229
00:23:06.200 --> 00:23:12.880
They go down to dance and sing.
 Uncle Hans can last for days!

230
00:23:13.040 --> 00:23:18.560
- We usually call him the wild boar.
 - You can invite him here.

231
00:23:18.720 --> 00:23:23.360
Hans is not invited.
 He comes anyway.

232
00:23:23.520 --> 00:23:28.800
- You didn't like the Christmas present, huh?
 - Yes, it was great.

233
00:23:28.960 --> 00:23:33.720
I thought it suited you perfectly!

234
00:23:33.880 --> 00:23:39.160
- A big green lizard ... - A Australian leaf knipers!

235
00:23:39.320 --> 00:23:45.760
They said it is very southern!
 There are only ten in Sweden.

236
00:23:45.920 --> 00:23:52.120
- Soon there are only nine ... - you don't have to have it at home.

237
00:23:52.280 --> 00:23:56.880
Have it in the office!
 It can catch flies.

238
00:23:57.040 --> 00:24:02.480
Gustav too, but I don't want him in the office ...

239
00:24:02.640 --> 00:24:08.360
- When they come home from the test tour?
 - When Gustav broke his leg.

240
00:24:12.800 --> 00:24:16.320
Gustav ... what happened?

241
00:24:16.480 --> 00:24:20.960
- Sara, some here want to talk to you.
 -What?

242
00:24:21.120 --> 00:24:23.640
Uncle Hans!

243
00:24:30.000 --> 00:24:36.040
- You would be on Lanzarote!
 - Senior storm - the plane was canceled.

244
00:24:36.200 --> 00:24:40.360
- So we celebrate Christmas with you!
 - What is it?

245
00:24:40.520 --> 00:24:44.880
- Lena and Gustav ... —They can also join!

246
00:24:45.040 --> 00:24:51.600
It's only Christmas once a year.
 - Pull up the Christmas tree, and we'll dance!

247
00:24:53.880 --> 00:24:58.240
Now it's Christmas again, and now it's Christmas again ...

248
00:25:06.280 --> 00:25:11.640
I got a Christmas present from Uncle Hans - a bottle of Skåne.

249
00:25:11.800 --> 00:25:15.320
Well.
 But that was good?

250
00:25:15.480 --> 00:25:17.760
Darling...

251
00:25:17.920 --> 00:25:20.280
Merry Christmas!

252
00:25:20.440 --> 00:25:25.640
Merry Christmas.
 We may take that family peace next year ...

253
00:25:25.800 --> 00:25:30.560
We let them dance for a while, and we will call the police then.

254
00:26:17.000 --> 00:26:19.000
