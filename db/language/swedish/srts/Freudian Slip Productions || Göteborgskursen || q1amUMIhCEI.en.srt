1
00:00:00,380 --> 00:00:02,520
Every year some move to Gothenburg

2
00:00:02,520 --> 00:00:04,100
Where it is easy to fit in

3
00:00:04,100 --> 00:00:06,100
But it can be nice with an introduction

4
00:00:06,280 --> 00:00:08,100
So that's why we've created the Gothenburg course

5
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:09,980
Hello or!?

6
00:00:09,980 --> 00:00:11,580
Welcome to the Gothenburg course

7
00:00:11,800 --> 00:00:13,800
So j*vla tense and see where you come from

8
00:00:13,800 --> 00:00:14,660
You can start

9
00:00:14,660 --> 00:00:15,440
Stockholm

10
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:16,580
Tighten whole*ete!

11
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:20,740
J*vla tidy, they think they are something

12
00:00:20,740 --> 00:00:23,160
We listen to your needs, to constantly get better

13
00:00:23,180 --> 00:00:27,120
I'm sober alcoholic, so I wonder if there are any AA meetings?

14
00:00:27,120 --> 00:00:30,040
I don't actually know, they are so damn secretive

15
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:34,540
I think it's super that you go there

16
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:38,000
But there is probably no wine-wine situation

17
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:43,200
We punch holes on some old prejudices

18
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:45,200
Not everyone is called Glenn in Gothenburg

19
00:00:45,800 --> 00:00:47,040
Not me, for example.

20
00:00:47,040 --> 00:00:48,240
What's your name then?

21
00:00:48,240 --> 00:00:48,740
Jocke

22
00:00:49,720 --> 00:00:50,300
Glennsson

23
00:00:50,980 --> 00:00:52,700
Then also learn a little Gothenburg

24
00:00:52,700 --> 00:00:54,580
Yes, you want some translation on the following:

25
00:00:54,820 --> 00:00:56,820
Hello.
 How Ã© the situation?

26
00:00:56,820 --> 00:00:58,820
What fun OSE you, it was a long time!

27
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:00,580
And it will be in Gothenburg

28
00:01:00,580 --> 00:01:01,840
Hello or!?

29
00:01:02,340 --> 00:01:04,100
How do you translate '' what are you doing? ''

30
00:01:04,100 --> 00:01:06,100
Yes it will be completely different.
 It becomes

31
00:01:06,100 --> 00:01:07,220
Hello orne!?

32
00:01:08,160 --> 00:01:10,160
The course also includes a nice tour

33
00:01:10,520 --> 00:01:12,640
Broken water: Completely J*VLA useless

34
00:01:13,260 --> 00:01:15,260
It is called the best-coast for some reason huh?

35
00:01:16,840 --> 00:01:17,900
Hey, what are you doing?!

36
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:21,320
When you look like this you have to intervene

37
00:01:21,580 --> 00:01:23,320
Hello, so you can't keep up there!

38
00:01:23,620 --> 00:01:25,800
You pie your back, I can help here!

39
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:28,680
Oh yeah, I have it.
 I have it.

40
00:01:29,100 --> 00:01:30,300
Have a good time now then old men

41
00:01:31,740 --> 00:01:33,160
Wasn't there any burglary?

42
00:01:33,160 --> 00:01:35,160
No for f*n, it was good guys

43
00:01:35,160 --> 00:01:37,900
Just like the nice guys we helped down to Syria last week

44
00:01:38,220 --> 00:01:40,220
They would sell ice apparently

45
00:01:40,460 --> 00:01:43,900
Now we are on Avenyn, which shows that Gothenburg is a real big city

46
00:01:43,900 --> 00:01:45,900
Because here is always full of people

47
00:01:46,760 --> 00:01:50,440
Except on Saturday afternoons, Sundays, everyday evenings ...

48
00:01:50,440 --> 00:01:51,760
Saturday before pay ...

49
00:01:51,760 --> 00:01:53,120
And when nothing happens at Ullevi ...

50
00:01:53,120 --> 00:01:54,180
When they happen something at Ullevi ...

51
00:01:54,180 --> 00:01:55,220
When it rains outside ..

52
00:01:55,220 --> 00:01:56,300
Some summer weeks ...

53
00:01:56,300 --> 00:01:58,300
And we provide important information about local traffic

54
00:01:58,300 --> 00:01:59,960
This is the tram

55
00:01:59,960 --> 00:02:02,320
And that is by far the fastest way to get ahead

56
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:04,520
If one does not go then we say

57
00:02:04,520 --> 00:02:07,200
The tour ends on our fine island Hissingen

58
00:02:07,380 --> 00:02:08,260
Oh then we are at the hissing

59
00:02:09,820 --> 00:02:11,460
There is a lot to see, you get to duck a little

60
00:02:11,460 --> 00:02:12,180
One can look quickly

61
00:02:12,180 --> 00:02:12,680
So

62
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:16,040
There is Hjalmar Branting eg.

63
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:18,480
So sign up for the Gothenburg course today
