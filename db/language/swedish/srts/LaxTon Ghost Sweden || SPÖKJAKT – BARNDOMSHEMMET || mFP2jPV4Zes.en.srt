1
00:02:15,043 --> 00:02:18,491
There are few times in Laxton's history that we have difficulty putting words

2
00:02:18,491 --> 00:02:20,567
on an investigation we will conduct.

3
00:02:20,852 --> 00:02:23,271
But this time it really is.

4
00:02:24,731 --> 00:02:28,749
It is with mixed feelings that we are now back in our childhood apartment in Kiruna.

5
00:02:28,749 --> 00:02:31,698
Where everything started almost 35 years ago.

6
00:02:34,110 --> 00:02:37,555
Memories from our childhood flushes over us, and the interior of the apartment

7
00:02:37,555 --> 00:02:40,602
As our mother built and installed is still there.

8
00:02:42,189 --> 00:02:45,325
We have the purpose of being back right here and it is ...

9
00:02:45,769 --> 00:02:49,959
Becomes contact stronger at the place where our cousins Peter and Johanna

10
00:02:49,959 --> 00:02:51,669
spent his last time in life?

11
00:02:52,653 --> 00:02:56,671
And can we get in touch with our mother who loved this apartment?

12
00:03:00,891 --> 00:03:03,853
Then we have entered here in our childhood apartment.

13
00:03:03,853 --> 00:03:08,996
-We are up in Kiruna, so we have made our way to the apartment where we grew up.

14
00:03:08,996 --> 00:03:13,376
Where it all started and where Laxton also grew up.

15
00:03:13,376 --> 00:03:17,831
What I mean is that it grew up, the interest started in this apartment.

16
00:03:18,370 --> 00:03:23,435
We had paranormal phenomena that happened here, which made us so fascinated

17
00:03:23,435 --> 00:03:24,880
That we stand here today.

18
00:03:26,816 --> 00:03:30,363
I can say like this that do you want to know what it was like for us to step into this apartment

19
00:03:30,363 --> 00:03:34,489
For the first time, we have done a pod about this that you can listen to.

20
00:03:34,934 --> 00:03:37,761
There is also a video odd so you can watch it if you want to do it.

21
00:03:38,522 --> 00:03:42,444
What is so special to be here and talk about memories with our one sister.

22
00:03:42,888 --> 00:03:45,903
Who started telling memories that didn't even remember.

23
00:03:46,189 --> 00:03:50,442
It was totally sick.
 I don't even remember the paranormal memories, I've suppressed them.

24
00:03:50,918 --> 00:03:55,094
So there are certainly more memories inside the head of one, but they are gone.

25
00:03:55,443 --> 00:03:59,095
-But it is special to be back and we have to thank those who have the apartment today.

26
00:03:59,095 --> 00:04:00,529
That we may come here.

27
00:04:00,529 --> 00:04:04,161
Because the apartment itself is not haunted right now.

28
00:04:04,161 --> 00:04:06,507
We always go to places where it is said that a lot of things happen.

29
00:04:07,110 --> 00:04:11,494
Now we got the chance when we were in Kiruna to actually visit this apartment.

30
00:04:11,494 --> 00:04:18,762
And now we will find out if we can get in touch with Peter and Johanna.

31
00:04:18,762 --> 00:04:21,970
Our cousins that tragically passed away in this fire in 1988.

32
00:04:21,970 --> 00:04:25,350
Where they spent their last hours in this apartment.

33
00:04:25,699 --> 00:04:27,388
Shit what dizzy I became when I talked about them.

34
00:04:27,388 --> 00:04:29,536
It just spins ...

35
00:04:30,488 --> 00:04:32,959
My eyes ... it feels like I would start to faint when I said that.

36
00:04:32,959 --> 00:04:34,344
That was damn uncomfortable.

37
00:04:37,422 --> 00:04:40,535
-It can also be when you listened to the pod, we talked about the wrong year.

38
00:04:40,535 --> 00:04:42,218
You get completely gone.

39
00:04:42,218 --> 00:04:44,541
But we should not forget that there are a lot of emotions here.

40
00:04:45,048 --> 00:04:48,600
Our own feelings that the brain starts to work with when we came in here.

41
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:51,187
Because it is so many years we lived here and experienced things.

42
00:04:51,758 --> 00:04:54,936
What is the unique when we come here as Tony said

43
00:04:54,936 --> 00:04:57,913
So those who live here now do not notice anything at all.

44
00:04:58,325 --> 00:05:03,859
But we should try in an experimental way.

45
00:05:05,097 --> 00:05:06,000
I can't even talk.

46
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:10,707
- We will try with an experiment.
 This is strange, we always be able to convey directly.

47
00:05:10,707 --> 00:05:12,131
So I'm a swine.

48
00:05:12,131 --> 00:05:13,652
Wondering what the hell was that happened there.

49
00:05:17,238 --> 00:05:20,425
We will test different things and see if we get in touch with Peter and Johanna.

50
00:05:20,425 --> 00:05:23,653
But also our mother who loved this apartment.

51
00:05:24,383 --> 00:05:29,872
- There are details left from our upbringing that mom brought here.

52
00:05:29,872 --> 00:05:32,311
They are repainted now, but we will be close to this.

53
00:05:32,311 --> 00:05:38,814
But we will then seek contact with loved ones, which we have never done in this way before.

54
00:05:39,353 --> 00:05:43,667
But now we are in this apartment and then we will see who wants to get through.

55
00:05:43,953 --> 00:05:48,874
She who lives here now has no activity, but she said we want to test our theory around this

56
00:05:48,874 --> 00:05:51,019
So you have this apartment to do it in.

57
00:05:51,019 --> 00:05:52,416
Now I start to shudder about my legs.

58
00:05:52,416 --> 00:05:54,000
So this is totally sick.

59
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
- I wonder if I should sit down.

60
00:05:58,189 --> 00:05:59,566
Shall we back in or should I ...

61
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,070
- No, go and sit on the couch.

62
00:06:01,070 --> 00:06:02,320
- I sit down for a while on the couch.

63
00:06:04,478 --> 00:06:09,139
- But if we say they are here now and they come in, because they hear that we are talking about them.

64
00:06:10,503 --> 00:06:13,062
I don't know what it is, there is something heavy here.

65
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:16,694
It is very difficult to say if there is something paranormal or if it is the brain that works.

66
00:06:17,011 --> 00:06:18,791
- I don't know either, it was ...

67
00:06:19,426 --> 00:06:22,890
... a dizziness that came only came from nowhere.

68
00:06:22,890 --> 00:06:24,508
I thought "now I'm fainting here".

69
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:26,002
We have lots of stuff here now.

70
00:06:26,002 --> 00:06:29,035
- Yes we have instruments that are here.

71
00:06:31,796 --> 00:06:37,510
.
 We have never done anything like this before, now we should actively seek contact with our cousins

72
00:06:37,510 --> 00:06:39,614
Who passed away in this fire, and our mother.

73
00:06:39,614 --> 00:06:42,007
- Exactly, but should we first try ...

74
00:06:43,607 --> 00:06:44,486
Oh my brain.

75
00:06:44,962 --> 00:06:45,946
I do not know what it is.

76
00:06:47,057 --> 00:06:48,476
I shake and ...

77
00:06:48,857 --> 00:06:52,404
I can also say that I felt bad and had a headache since we came here.

78
00:06:53,705 --> 00:06:58,496
I don't know, but should we first seek contact with the mother?

79
00:07:01,904 --> 00:07:07,314
We have a PRS here, which has static fields and now we place it right in front of us.

80
00:07:07,885 --> 00:07:11,117
Then we have a new thing ahead of us too, should we post it too?

81
00:07:11,466 --> 00:07:13,221
Or should we just take an instrument?

82
00:07:14,459 --> 00:07:18,345
We know that there is nothing that disturbs the person who lives here now.

83
00:07:18,726 --> 00:07:21,256
But do we drag anything with us?
 That is the question.

84
00:07:22,324 --> 00:07:24,000
I place this one, and we'll see.

85
00:07:25,174 --> 00:07:29,850
And you who have seen it know for sure about close contact and static fields.

86
00:07:30,643 --> 00:07:32,462
- Okay, we back here then.

87
00:07:33,890 --> 00:07:36,617
We have lived in this apartment for many years.

88
00:07:37,505 --> 00:07:40,435
This is where we celebrated Christmas Eve together.

89
00:07:41,165 --> 00:07:44,289
So if Peter or Johanna is still here ...

90
00:07:44,638 --> 00:07:46,477
Could you be able to go up to

91
00:07:46,477 --> 00:07:51,062
This tool that is on the table and touching the stick that is there?

92
00:07:53,093 --> 00:07:55,394
If you are here, go up to

93
00:07:56,124 --> 00:07:58,318
This thing that is on the table.

94
00:08:01,459 --> 00:08:02,908
Is our mother here?

95
00:08:02,908 --> 00:08:03,632
Irene.

96
00:08:04,996 --> 00:08:06,000
Are you with us?

97
00:08:14,314 --> 00:08:17,734
Take energy from us, something affected us when we came in here.

98
00:08:18,242 --> 00:08:20,183
I don't know what it is.

99
00:08:21,865 --> 00:08:23,709
But take energy from us.

100
00:08:25,137 --> 00:08:27,340
Stir the instrument here.

101
00:08:28,070 --> 00:08:30,451
When we were little here, things were thrown.

102
00:08:30,990 --> 00:08:32,355
If you have that kind of power

103
00:08:33,910 --> 00:08:34,980
So you have to do it too.

104
00:08:39,073 --> 00:08:41,724
And when we say Irene, it's the name of our mother.

105
00:08:42,898 --> 00:08:44,353
We put this new one too.

106
00:08:44,734 --> 00:08:46,569
We can only direct it straight out here.

107
00:08:46,886 --> 00:08:49,403
I thought we should place it somewhere on the floor.

108
00:08:49,403 --> 00:08:50,905
We were sitting on the Christmas table

109
00:08:51,286 --> 00:08:52,814
Here somewhere.
 Should I post it?

110
00:08:54,680 --> 00:08:55,830
We take the chair here.

111
00:09:02,938 --> 00:09:04,420
So if something then comes

112
00:09:05,404 --> 00:09:06,279
So you see that it gets

113
00:09:06,914 --> 00:09:07,673
White

114
00:09:09,450 --> 00:09:10,406
It's this pyramid

115
00:09:11,696 --> 00:09:12,605
So if

116
00:09:13,240 --> 00:09:17,241
Irene, our mother.
 If you can get through stronger.

117
00:09:17,841 --> 00:09:21,088
Now that we are in this apartment where there was a lot of joy.

118
00:09:21,945 --> 00:09:24,137
A lot of children, we were many children.

119
00:09:25,406 --> 00:09:26,693
Is there more

120
00:09:27,296 --> 00:09:29,782
Chances for us to talk to you here?

121
00:09:31,400 --> 00:09:32,886
Can you come in to us here?

122
00:09:33,457 --> 00:09:34,886
And touch this iron stick.

123
00:09:35,362 --> 00:09:36,876
-A real shudder came and went here now.

124
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:40,534
- You sit in an active corner then when we lived here.

125
00:09:40,788 --> 00:09:43,726
Right in that corner there were a lot of things that happened, we had a guitar.

126
00:09:44,583 --> 00:09:46,633
We had a guitar that was here and then ...

127
00:09:47,204 --> 00:09:50,203
What I was told that I forgot about was the paranormal event that

128
00:09:51,060 --> 00:09:54,397
Someone played on those guitars when I was home alone, so I panicked.

129
00:09:54,587 --> 00:09:56,739
And this I don't remember, I've probably suppressed it.

130
00:09:57,247 --> 00:09:58,924
- Mom, if you're here with us

131
00:09:59,622 --> 00:10:01,295
can you touch this white

132
00:10:01,708 --> 00:10:03,732
The thing that is on the chair here?

133
00:10:04,716 --> 00:10:06,766
Can you go past it once only?

134
00:10:08,321 --> 00:10:09,865
Can you do it now?

135
00:10:20,241 --> 00:10:22,288
After all, there are not so big rooms here.

136
00:10:23,081 --> 00:10:27,332
So we don't have that much surface to move, there are lots of furniture too.

137
00:10:27,935 --> 00:10:29,740
- but we take a room successively and

138
00:10:30,279 --> 00:10:32,982
We start with this everyday living room really.

139
00:10:35,140 --> 00:10:36,400
Is Peter here?

140
00:10:36,734 --> 00:10:38,661
Busy Peter, are you here?

141
00:10:40,248 --> 00:10:43,636
Can you touch that white pyramid on the chair?

142
00:10:48,142 --> 00:10:49,659
- Johanna, if you're here ...

143
00:10:52,229 --> 00:10:56,129
I remember when you were standing in the hall with your red dress and asked if you could sleep over here.

144
00:10:58,160 --> 00:11:00,894
Some feel you at the museum in Borås as well.

145
00:11:02,195 --> 00:11:03,801
But if you are here now

146
00:11:04,023 --> 00:11:06,259
In this apartment where you spent

147
00:11:06,608 --> 00:11:09,911
Your last hours with Peter and your entire family.

148
00:11:11,276 --> 00:11:15,977
Can you touch that white pyramid that is on the chair.

149
00:11:22,006 --> 00:11:23,528
Can you knock somewhere?

150
00:11:24,194 --> 00:11:25,239
In this way.

151
00:11:29,237 --> 00:11:30,595
- It sounded from there.

152
00:11:31,927 --> 00:11:33,912
After you knocked, a knock came from there.

153
00:11:33,912 --> 00:11:34,936
- From the toan?

154
00:11:36,142 --> 00:11:36,875
Should we check?

155
00:11:40,714 --> 00:11:42,702
Here is this hall Niclas.

156
00:11:43,146 --> 00:11:45,517
Where the horse flew down.

157
00:11:46,881 --> 00:11:49,248
It was something that flashed after you.

158
00:11:49,819 --> 00:11:51,130
- Did it blink after me?

159
00:11:54,144 --> 00:11:55,507
Can we put an instrument here?

160
00:11:56,427 --> 00:11:57,892
Should we take the pyramid?

161
00:11:59,003 --> 00:12:00,833
- Good, now it's something.

162
00:12:01,404 --> 00:12:03,041
Who is here?

163
00:12:03,580 --> 00:12:05,841
If it is you Peter, then get it to blink again.

164
00:12:05,841 --> 00:12:07,261
No, it was Johanna you talked about.

165
00:12:10,085 --> 00:12:10,883
- Did you hear knocks Johan?

166
00:12:11,073 --> 00:12:14,493
- Yes, when you knocked in the table, it just knocked out here

167
00:12:14,493 --> 00:12:19,382
At the end of the corridor, I have a free ear so I hear.

168
00:12:22,968 --> 00:12:24,000
- What instruments should you have?

169
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,303
- I'll take this pyramid.

170
00:12:25,303 --> 00:12:27,731
I put this in the corridor again.

171
00:12:33,320 --> 00:12:36,900
Here it fell a horse, a small toy horse

172
00:12:37,408 --> 00:12:38,285
from the roof

173
00:12:38,920 --> 00:12:41,120
When I was with my best friend here.

174
00:12:42,421 --> 00:12:43,530
When I was little.

175
00:12:45,688 --> 00:12:49,814
Can the one who did it, I think it was Peter or Johanna who wanted to cuddle a little.

176
00:12:50,766 --> 00:12:52,002
Can you arrive

177
00:12:52,573 --> 00:12:54,459
And touch the one on the floor now?

178
00:12:55,189 --> 00:12:56,388
It was something that snapped here.

179
00:12:58,609 --> 00:13:00,000
- But if you stand here.

180
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,466
So I sit here.

181
00:13:02,704 --> 00:13:05,939
- I take some communication now, I take the Polterscript.

182
00:13:05,939 --> 00:13:08,032
So we try to communicate with

183
00:13:10,285 --> 00:13:12,169
Either our cousins or mom who are here.

184
00:13:16,421 --> 00:13:18,000
Anyone here with us?

185
00:13:21,205 --> 00:13:21,986
Johanna.

186
00:13:23,382 --> 00:13:24,255
Peter.

187
00:13:28,126 --> 00:13:29,198
Or our mother.

188
00:13:33,196 --> 00:13:34,846
Can you knock again here?

189
00:13:41,859 --> 00:13:43,467
I'll be here in the corridor to you

190
00:13:44,578 --> 00:13:45,897
If you are here.

191
00:13:49,610 --> 00:13:52,929
It must be special that we are back here, if you are with us.

192
00:13:54,833 --> 00:13:56,804
Take our energy and

193
00:13:58,264 --> 00:14:00,000
Communicate with us if you like.

194
00:14:05,870 --> 00:14:07,486
Nothing here on

195
00:14:09,136 --> 00:14:10,723
The Polterscribet either.

196
00:14:12,405 --> 00:14:13,562
Do you get anything inside Niclas?

197
00:14:17,370 --> 00:14:19,639
It is this dizziness that I feel all the time.

198
00:14:20,623 --> 00:14:24,000
- It feels like I have blood sugar drops, I just sit and shake.
 I do not know what it is.

199
00:14:26,538 --> 00:14:28,407
Mom, if you can get through here now

200
00:14:29,613 --> 00:14:30,943
So go beside Tony there

201
00:14:31,165 --> 00:14:33,138
And use that thing he has in his hand.

202
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,311
Should we try to move that to that corner?

203
00:14:49,483 --> 00:14:51,836
- I'll take the triangle back, because I think it's good to bring.

204
00:14:52,407 --> 00:14:53,499
So we see if they ...

205
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,000
- Now I start it.

206
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:58,265
Now we have sat here in the living room again and we just have the things here.

207
00:14:58,773 --> 00:15:00,230
Because I want to...

208
00:15:00,992 --> 00:15:02,218
I don't want to run around.

209
00:15:02,948 --> 00:15:04,082
You understand what I mean.

210
00:15:04,336 --> 00:15:07,631
We will go to those rooms and successively test to be there.

211
00:15:08,107 --> 00:15:09,163
And try to be there.

212
00:15:09,480 --> 00:15:11,012
And that's a theory we want to test now.

213
00:15:11,520 --> 00:15:13,741
And we know that this comes in waves all the time.

214
00:15:14,598 --> 00:15:16,591
We have put our PRS there

215
00:15:16,845 --> 00:15:20,484
which takes static fields and the REM function in that corner.

216
00:15:20,484 --> 00:15:24,334
Where we experienced things.
 We had a statue that fell there, we had

217
00:15:24,683 --> 00:15:28,507
Something that played on the guitar, who pulled on the strings though no one was in the room.

218
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:30,724
But I don't understand why you feel like this.

219
00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:35,199
- The instruments right now indicate nothing.

220
00:15:35,485 --> 00:15:39,236
Nothing on communication either, but the body reacts to anything.

221
00:15:39,712 --> 00:15:43,550
And I don't know if it's just because you mentally and mentally think about being here.

222
00:15:43,899 --> 00:15:46,620
With all the memories that it is so.

223
00:15:47,096 --> 00:15:48,467
But we'll see.

224
00:15:48,753 --> 00:15:49,882
That said, we

225
00:15:49,882 --> 00:15:52,039
Have never done it this way before.

226
00:15:52,420 --> 00:15:54,527
To actively seek contact with

227
00:15:55,860 --> 00:15:58,257
Our relatives, our loved ones.

228
00:16:00,224 --> 00:16:01,948
- Peter, Johanna

229
00:16:02,614 --> 00:16:03,566
As you walked away

230
00:16:04,772 --> 00:16:06,854
So things started to happen in this apartment.

231
00:16:10,313 --> 00:16:12,431
Was it you who played on that guitar?

232
00:16:15,840 --> 00:16:16,946
That scared me.

233
00:16:17,454 --> 00:16:19,141
I didn't really understand what it was.

234
00:16:27,582 --> 00:16:31,400
We really want you to get as close as you can, into this room.

235
00:16:31,622 --> 00:16:34,758
You see this white pyramid here, if you go in front of it

236
00:16:37,582 --> 00:16:40,499
So it will start to shine white, and then it means you are in front of it.

237
00:16:44,434 --> 00:16:45,476
And it doesn't hurt you.

238
00:16:56,126 --> 00:16:57,825
-Nothing like this anyway

239
00:16:58,682 --> 00:17:01,664
Who wants to get in touch with us now.

240
00:17:02,267 --> 00:17:03,478
So it is after all

241
00:17:06,461 --> 00:17:07,217
interesting.

242
00:17:09,692 --> 00:17:11,173
- If we take this theory

243
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,945
For she who lives here, she has her loved ones next door.

244
00:17:16,278 --> 00:17:18,603
And they might be walking around here

245
00:17:19,016 --> 00:17:20,387
And don't let in any others.

246
00:17:20,768 --> 00:17:22,920
And they don't want to talk to us at all.

247
00:17:22,920 --> 00:17:25,343
- Should we just test that theory and ask a question ...

248
00:17:26,390 --> 00:17:27,881
The one who lives here today?

249
00:17:28,865 --> 00:17:31,274
She has let us in here.
 Is any of

250
00:17:32,226 --> 00:17:35,344
Her family's relatives left here?

251
00:17:36,232 --> 00:17:37,572
In this apartment?

252
00:17:38,492 --> 00:17:40,041
Can you arrive at any of these

253
00:17:40,898 --> 00:17:41,786
The things we have?

254
00:17:46,514 --> 00:17:47,769
- There we have static down there.

255
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:50,035
- Now it shines.

256
00:17:50,352 --> 00:17:50,869
- Good.

257
00:17:51,757 --> 00:17:54,610
You who have come here now, you who are in the corner where we have

258
00:17:55,245 --> 00:17:56,399
Tagged and known

259
00:18:02,967 --> 00:18:05,579
Giants what it is strong in that direction.
 Very strong.

260
00:18:06,245 --> 00:18:08,058
And that's exactly in the corner it was.

261
00:18:09,232 --> 00:18:10,057
And now it comes.

262
00:18:11,675 --> 00:18:13,105
- And what do we have here?

263
00:18:13,803 --> 00:18:18,000
- Can you get it to be piped at once if it is Peter who is here?

264
00:18:24,696 --> 00:18:28,683
Can you get it to pipe twice if it's Peter?

265
00:18:29,571 --> 00:18:31,075
- Two, did you hear?

266
00:18:34,534 --> 00:18:36,000
It gets stronger and stronger.

267
00:18:42,695 --> 00:18:44,315
It has lit all the lights, don't you see it?

268
00:18:44,315 --> 00:18:46,649
- I see it, I don't understand what it does there.

269
00:18:47,062 --> 00:18:49,103
There is such a jerk field around that now.

270
00:18:50,531 --> 00:18:51,357
- Peter

271
00:18:52,848 --> 00:18:54,368
Stir the antenna vigorously.

272
00:18:57,700 --> 00:19:01,036
Now all lamps go on static field.

273
00:19:01,480 --> 00:19:03,922
There extinguish ... no they are still there.

274
00:19:09,304 --> 00:19:10,021
Can you do

275
00:19:11,163 --> 00:19:12,225
make a

276
00:19:13,304 --> 00:19:15,031
Cushion for "yes" and two for "no"?

277
00:19:22,424 --> 00:19:23,677
Peter, are you with us?

278
00:19:24,788 --> 00:19:25,853
At the museum?

279
00:19:32,675 --> 00:19:35,532
Have you come here Peter, now that we got to this apartment?

280
00:19:36,516 --> 00:19:37,169
"yes"

281
00:19:42,436 --> 00:19:44,088
Here Peter I have one thing in my hand.

282
00:19:48,911 --> 00:19:51,387
-If you want to say something to Tony, go near him there.

283
00:19:56,274 --> 00:19:59,806
Can you make it beep longer by holding that iron stick longer?

284
00:20:04,185 --> 00:20:06,000
- So that field came from nowhere.

285
00:20:07,016 --> 00:20:11,269
Again you get a feeling, you put this one instead and so

286
00:20:11,523 --> 00:20:15,170
- Theoretically why was it in the corner we experienced things?

287
00:20:15,741 --> 00:20:17,233
Why exactly that corner?

288
00:20:18,344 --> 00:20:21,837
And here we now see that the static field is very strong.

289
00:20:24,534 --> 00:20:26,411
Do you have Johanna with you too?

290
00:20:31,615 --> 00:20:33,845
- "No" ice cream, there were almost three beeps.

291
00:20:34,162 --> 00:20:36,517
Do you have Irene there, our mom?

292
00:20:41,753 --> 00:20:43,093
Are you Peter yourself?

293
00:20:44,331 --> 00:20:45,477
- Are you alone?

294
00:20:49,539 --> 00:20:50,343
- "Yes"

295
00:20:53,643 --> 00:20:54,773
- Peter ...

296
00:20:56,137 --> 00:20:59,840
We assume it is you, because it seems that you answer when we ask if it is Peter.

297
00:20:59,840 --> 00:21:00,657
Is it

298
00:21:01,514 --> 00:21:02,866
That corner

299
00:21:04,516 --> 00:21:08,060
As all activity was strongest.
 Why exactly that corner?

300
00:21:13,486 --> 00:21:15,201
It sounded like it was small in the wall at that corner.

301
00:21:18,850 --> 00:21:20,799
- Can you go to any other tool?

302
00:21:21,624 --> 00:21:22,644
Can you release ...

303
00:21:23,247 --> 00:21:24,000
“growing”

304
00:21:27,173 --> 00:21:30,708
-We see that something is growing here now, is you trying

305
00:21:31,184 --> 00:21:34,223
make you visible to us?
 Can you show up for us?

306
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:37,281
So we can see you?

307
00:21:43,945 --> 00:21:47,061
I wonder if we are directing the pyramid in that direction Tony, if you put it on the edge.

308
00:21:50,329 --> 00:21:51,016
- “baby”

309
00:21:55,109 --> 00:21:56,332
It was very strong now.

310
00:21:56,491 --> 00:21:58,962
- Don't you want me to put the pyramid in that direction?

311
00:22:04,198 --> 00:22:04,995
- "David"

312
00:22:06,423 --> 00:22:08,621
- David is my friend.

313
00:22:09,192 --> 00:22:10,240
- "Complete"

314
00:22:12,874 --> 00:22:14,792
My God what it builds up energy.

315
00:22:16,474 --> 00:22:17,605
"medicine"

316
00:22:18,811 --> 00:22:19,747
“49 years”

317
00:22:31,345 --> 00:22:32,986
- What is going on?

318
00:22:32,986 --> 00:22:34,145
- It's really strong!

319
00:22:34,558 --> 00:22:37,072
- We are putting the pyramid in this way now.

320
00:22:38,278 --> 00:22:38,818
“Kitchen”

321
00:22:40,627 --> 00:22:43,390
Here you get it, put it on the support there.

322
00:22:48,657 --> 00:22:50,021
It said "grows".

323
00:22:50,624 --> 00:22:54,000
It's just to check, it's like you want to pop popcorn or something.

324
00:22:56,443 --> 00:22:58,500
- go by between me here

325
00:22:58,500 --> 00:23:01,138
Or between the sofa and this office once, can you do it?

326
00:23:01,360 --> 00:23:02,446
Pass here

327
00:23:02,605 --> 00:23:03,766
in that way.

328
00:23:07,415 --> 00:23:08,646
- What is going on?

329
00:23:08,646 --> 00:23:10,063
- It sucks out the battery.

330
00:23:11,111 --> 00:23:12,635
-I have never seen this.

331
00:23:13,048 --> 00:23:14,519
I've never seen this before.

332
00:23:16,080 --> 00:23:17,355
It's really strange.

333
00:23:17,355 --> 00:23:18,333
- Really.

334
00:23:21,823 --> 00:23:23,580
- I'll pick up another instrument.

335
00:23:26,785 --> 00:23:27,556
- Peter

336
00:23:28,476 --> 00:23:29,825
Are you left here in the corner?

337
00:23:31,634 --> 00:23:32,667
“writes”

338
00:23:35,745 --> 00:23:36,618
"remove"

339
00:23:48,993 --> 00:23:50,632
- Wait, it's really strange.

340
00:23:51,616 --> 00:23:54,150
It feels like trapped air.

341
00:23:55,800 --> 00:23:58,660
And the smell was like ...

342
00:23:59,295 --> 00:24:00,777
There was a very heavy air here ...

343
00:24:01,856 --> 00:24:04,171
How the hell should I explain that, it was really strange.

344
00:24:08,106 --> 00:24:10,549
- Should I try to remove it and put it back on the table?

345
00:24:10,549 --> 00:24:11,049
- No, let it be.

346
00:24:11,049 --> 00:24:11,549
- Should it remain there?

347
00:24:12,160 --> 00:24:16,480
- What we start up now is one that will show green on one side and red on the other side.

348
00:24:16,988 --> 00:24:18,505
And use it as "yes" and "no".

349
00:24:19,426 --> 00:24:22,064
And when we start this now they get to choose

350
00:24:22,572 --> 00:24:23,864
to respond to it as well by the fact that

351
00:24:24,594 --> 00:24:26,647
make it shine.

352
00:24:26,647 --> 00:24:27,877
Then we take red as “no”

353
00:24:28,290 --> 00:24:29,465
and green as "yes".

354
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:33,930
Peter, do you see the lamp that flashes there now?
 Can you go to it?

355
00:24:35,453 --> 00:24:37,524
If you leave it there and go to the next?

356
00:24:41,141 --> 00:24:43,312
Or is it Irene who has come here now?

357
00:24:45,216 --> 00:24:47,379
So I was completely breathless only I went to the kitchen.

358
00:24:47,760 --> 00:24:49,347
My eyes just run.

359
00:24:50,553 --> 00:24:51,484
This is really strange.

360
00:24:51,484 --> 00:24:55,716
- It would have been interesting that if it continues if we remove it from the field there ...

361
00:24:56,636 --> 00:24:58,358
We try, then maybe I happen to touch this one just.

362
00:25:07,909 --> 00:25:09,429
I understand how much that

363
00:25:10,222 --> 00:25:13,114
What a power field that just ... we try again then.

364
00:25:17,525 --> 00:25:19,124
- What is that in the corner?

365
00:25:19,314 --> 00:25:21,218
- Who came from nowhere?

366
00:25:23,503 --> 00:25:24,844
- But take it back here.

367
00:25:30,968 --> 00:25:34,565
You see how it works, Tony happened to touch the machine over there now.

368
00:25:36,913 --> 00:25:40,378
If you want to answer "no" to the questions then get it to shine red.

369
00:25:41,457 --> 00:25:44,233
If you want to answer "yes", get it to shine green.

370
00:25:47,121 --> 00:25:50,072
Okay, if you want to use this still, just come here.

371
00:25:51,976 --> 00:25:54,223
-It jumped from there to here and it continues.

372
00:25:57,523 --> 00:25:59,389
So what is it?
 Check.

373
00:26:01,737 --> 00:26:03,314
- We hear you Peter.

374
00:26:04,869 --> 00:26:06,165
If you have Irene ...

375
00:26:09,084 --> 00:26:10,484
Now it is the REM function.

376
00:26:11,277 --> 00:26:12,000
It's max.

377
00:26:12,444 --> 00:26:13,693
Away...

378
00:26:15,121 --> 00:26:16,572
Who came here now?

379
00:26:18,508 --> 00:26:19,945
Or that might be

380
00:26:20,580 --> 00:26:22,504
He was able to do?

381
00:26:22,980 --> 00:26:25,096
- Yes, like a discharge.

382
00:26:26,302 --> 00:26:27,300
Peter, are you left?

383
00:26:30,568 --> 00:26:32,184
- Irene, are you here now?

384
00:26:37,515 --> 00:26:39,202
Has Johanna come here?

385
00:26:46,532 --> 00:26:47,275
It works.

386
00:26:47,688 --> 00:26:49,459
- I thought the batteries had been drained on it.

387
00:26:49,459 --> 00:26:52,798
- No, but as long as the red lamp shines, it will work.

388
00:26:53,369 --> 00:26:54,854
This was really strange.

389
00:26:58,281 --> 00:27:01,816
- You didn't really get what he wanted.

390
00:27:01,816 --> 00:27:04,479
- No, but when we got "come", thus grow

391
00:27:05,114 --> 00:27:08,850
So it started to grow more and more, but I don't know ...

392
00:27:10,024 --> 00:27:11,706
If that was contact with Peter.

393
00:27:12,721 --> 00:27:13,650
He wanted to ...

394
00:27:13,990 --> 00:27:16,674
I asked if he could show up so we can see him.

395
00:27:17,753 --> 00:27:21,445
But we didn't see anything because then it was suddenly at zero.

396
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:26,415
- But we also get very sedentary.

397
00:27:28,002 --> 00:27:28,970
- We are testing another room.

398
00:27:30,906 --> 00:27:34,322
I shut down here, so the energy must accompany us to the next room I think.

399
00:27:37,908 --> 00:27:39,234
I think we take here.

400
00:27:40,186 --> 00:27:42,292
- Yes this is sick, this is, as I said, that room there

401
00:27:42,990 --> 00:27:44,698
I saw the plaster figure sliding.

402
00:27:44,698 --> 00:27:45,899
Over the floor here.

403
00:27:46,279 --> 00:27:48,392
When I sit right here.

404
00:27:48,741 --> 00:27:49,891
- Shall we do like this

405
00:27:49,891 --> 00:27:51,304
We put a PMB here.

406
00:27:51,304 --> 00:27:52,841
To see if there is anything that wants ...

407
00:27:53,571 --> 00:27:57,279
- I wonder if we should put something on the floor, where I saw the plaster figure slip.

408
00:28:01,785 --> 00:28:03,109
And the PMB you who don't have

409
00:28:04,537 --> 00:28:07,408
Look and know how it works, you can only show Niclas quickly.

410
00:28:09,439 --> 00:28:11,298
He places his hand over the unit.

411
00:28:13,900 --> 00:28:14,988
Then it sounds there.

412
00:28:14,988 --> 00:28:16,782
- I'm completely exhausted.

413
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:21,916
I don't know what it is, if it is an emotional storm that is going on in the skull now.

414
00:28:23,217 --> 00:28:24,956
- I don't want to sit down.

415
00:28:26,225 --> 00:28:29,158
I want to stand, but will see if I can fit because it is quite crowded in here.

416
00:28:29,729 --> 00:28:31,941
This was my room when I lived here.

417
00:28:33,813 --> 00:28:36,485
And I saw those plaster figures that slid over the floor.

418
00:28:37,659 --> 00:28:41,806
We start communication here as well, but you can go to the blue vibrant light.

419
00:28:42,790 --> 00:28:43,303
What was that?

420
00:28:43,303 --> 00:28:44,510
- I trampled on something.

421
00:28:45,145 --> 00:28:47,541
- But you can go to the blue pulsating light if you want.

422
00:28:48,937 --> 00:28:50,556
Or pass just above.

423
00:28:50,556 --> 00:28:52,634
Or talk to us through this.

424
00:28:54,506 --> 00:28:56,050
Does anyone with us here?

425
00:28:56,050 --> 00:28:57,555
Peter

426
00:29:00,474 --> 00:29:01,748
Johanna

427
00:29:04,477 --> 00:29:05,516
Or our mother?

428
00:29:07,737 --> 00:29:09,615
- Irene, if you can come in here

429
00:29:10,694 --> 00:29:13,735
And put your hand in front of that game box.

430
00:29:14,401 --> 00:29:16,604
You have been with us quite a few times I think.

431
00:29:16,604 --> 00:29:18,128
So I think you know how it works.

432
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:19,972
I sit down.

433
00:29:20,829 --> 00:29:23,577
- I'd rather sit in those chairs.

434
00:29:23,577 --> 00:29:27,021
Where I sat before in my desk chair.

435
00:29:27,021 --> 00:29:29,700
- Like recreating what it was like.

436
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:32,119
- "Begin", "Cold"

437
00:29:32,119 --> 00:29:34,547
- I have to say that it feels cooler around the floor.

438
00:29:34,547 --> 00:29:35,701
- That was exactly how it started.

439
00:29:36,875 --> 00:29:40,601
The wire says "Begin", "Cold", that is how I sit here and feel the cold.

440
00:29:41,014 --> 00:29:44,123
And when I turn around, I seem to see someone and I think the door is closed.

441
00:29:44,821 --> 00:29:46,478
About where Johan stands.

442
00:29:46,732 --> 00:29:48,709
That's when I see the plaster figure there.

443
00:29:49,280 --> 00:29:53,378
The one of you who moved the plaster figure, you can come

444
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:56,707
To the floor here where it flashes blue?

445
00:30:02,600 --> 00:30:03,806
- Peter

446
00:30:04,599 --> 00:30:05,729
You were recently

447
00:30:06,237 --> 00:30:08,267
And talked to us, we think it was you who came through.

448
00:30:08,267 --> 00:30:11,219
And we haven't talked to you for a long time.

449
00:30:11,568 --> 00:30:13,921
You have come through a little neighbor now and then.

450
00:30:15,063 --> 00:30:16,914
But can you come in here too?

451
00:30:18,501 --> 00:30:22,160
Do you see this game box standing on the bench?
 If you touch it

452
00:30:23,080 --> 00:30:24,659
Then it will play a little neighbor.

453
00:30:27,388 --> 00:30:29,560
Do you see what lies and flashes on the floor?

454
00:30:30,163 --> 00:30:34,294
Make it shine green for "yes" for example.
 And red for "no".

455
00:30:36,680 --> 00:30:39,813
Or if it is Johanna or mom who is also here

456
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:44,202
So get it to shine green if you hear me.

457
00:30:50,390 --> 00:30:51,922
Get it to play.

458
00:30:52,842 --> 00:30:54,000
If you hear me.

459
00:30:58,791 --> 00:31:02,002
After all, we have felt a discomfort when we lived here too.

460
00:31:02,986 --> 00:31:04,190
We also have

461
00:31:05,618 --> 00:31:07,399
done the "spirit in the glass"

462
00:31:08,097 --> 00:31:09,635
And such things.

463
00:31:10,809 --> 00:31:13,631
Do you like that we are still using Ouija Boards?

464
00:31:15,154 --> 00:31:16,980
Or does the "spirit in the glass"?

465
00:31:21,422 --> 00:31:23,336
- "Behind" (behind) I got up now.

466
00:31:24,383 --> 00:31:25,622
What do you mean by that?

467
00:31:26,352 --> 00:31:28,136
Are you behind Johan there?

468
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:33,693
If any of you are out there, can you enter this room?

469
00:31:35,660 --> 00:31:39,094
Recreate what you did, to move that plaster figure that

470
00:31:39,475 --> 00:31:40,852
Was here then.

471
00:31:41,265 --> 00:31:43,174
As our sister Tina received in Christmas present

472
00:31:43,903 --> 00:31:46,282
by you Johanna, you can pull past

473
00:31:46,536 --> 00:31:49,346
On the floor here now where it flashes blue.

474
00:31:54,455 --> 00:31:58,991
No, we don't get anything on the instruments in this room either.

475
00:32:05,750 --> 00:32:06,972
- We are testing one more room.

476
00:32:09,796 --> 00:32:11,653
- Should we try your room across?

477
00:32:15,280 --> 00:32:16,454
Here's your room.

478
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:22,031
You had an experience in bed where you felt like someone locked you.

479
00:32:22,031 --> 00:32:25,338
- Yes, it was not like Peter and Johanna.

480
00:32:26,036 --> 00:32:27,584
It felt like something else.

481
00:32:27,965 --> 00:32:31,188
It can come from all the different Ouija boards used.

482
00:32:31,887 --> 00:32:35,771
Everything cracked you did as younger, that you brought something with you.

483
00:32:36,311 --> 00:32:39,969
What happens when we are in your room over there you had and in my room here

484
00:32:40,477 --> 00:32:43,609
is that all rooms seem to lean in different directions.

485
00:32:44,180 --> 00:32:46,939
It is a very strange feeling that it is leaning.

486
00:32:47,447 --> 00:32:50,735
It feels like this room is leaning there.

487
00:32:52,766 --> 00:32:57,774
If I had released a bullet now, it would have felt like it would stick in that direction.

488
00:32:58,960 --> 00:33:01,091
We just put this out.

489
00:33:01,884 --> 00:33:03,875
So if you want to run communication you can do it too.

490
00:33:03,875 --> 00:33:04,723
- Yes, I'll start it at the same time.

491
00:33:04,723 --> 00:33:06,525
- So we'll see if there is something that wants to come in to us here.

492
00:33:10,333 --> 00:33:14,286
We'll see if it can shine red or green if something passes next to it.

493
00:33:17,364 --> 00:33:19,799
- so what was with Niclas there

494
00:33:20,212 --> 00:33:22,052
When he was little.

495
00:33:22,401 --> 00:33:24,000
Maybe it was the teens?

496
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:25,299
- I don't really remember.

497
00:33:26,568 --> 00:33:28,274
Are you left here then?

498
00:33:36,683 --> 00:33:42,000
- I think about our sister's experience when she sits there on the bed and sees a woman here.

499
00:33:45,839 --> 00:33:48,000
Who is that woman ice cream?

500
00:33:49,301 --> 00:33:54,730
- This is the only room where we have experienced something other than Peter and Johanna.

501
00:33:56,793 --> 00:33:58,628
- You feel damn tired.

502
00:33:59,009 --> 00:34:04,786
It feels if we have been going around here for six hours.

503
00:34:07,102 --> 00:34:08,909
It feels like it's starting to get late.

504
00:34:10,147 --> 00:34:11,402
It is a very strange feeling.

505
00:34:11,402 --> 00:34:15,543
-This is our theory now that we are testing to go back to our childhood home.

506
00:34:15,800 --> 00:34:17,814
We try to communicate with loved ones

507
00:34:17,814 --> 00:34:19,528
And see if they are here.

508
00:34:19,528 --> 00:34:21,445
- If it is stronger.

509
00:34:21,857 --> 00:34:25,301
- Or does it require it to be other items?

510
00:34:25,745 --> 00:34:27,637
So I mean this experiment

511
00:34:27,637 --> 00:34:29,903
We will also test at the haunted museum.

512
00:34:30,569 --> 00:34:33,011
And then we stand among these objects.

513
00:34:33,011 --> 00:34:35,678
And see if Peter and Johanna can in any way be stronger there.

514
00:34:36,249 --> 00:34:38,373
Because they say Johanna is running around there.

515
00:34:38,373 --> 00:34:39,693
So it is very interesting.

516
00:34:39,693 --> 00:34:42,472
- It is as you say that it might be more the objects that are coming.

517
00:34:42,472 --> 00:34:44,184
It may not be enough with these four walls, the shell

518
00:34:44,914 --> 00:34:47,317
In this case, in other cases it may be that you have built the house

519
00:34:47,317 --> 00:34:49,317
It is a stronger relationship with it that way.

520
00:34:49,634 --> 00:34:52,090
But there is nothing here.

521
00:34:53,200 --> 00:34:56,207
We come here and go in here, but it feels pretty ...

522
00:34:58,174 --> 00:35:01,744
Quiet except Peter if he was there now, if he was now.

523
00:35:01,998 --> 00:35:04,838
So it was just a very fast discharge.

524
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:08,295
- It may have been like this that during the time we lived here

525
00:35:08,295 --> 00:35:10,803
So there has always been a portal in that corner.

526
00:35:11,279 --> 00:35:15,833
Which built up that this was where they came through and we got something that went or came.

527
00:35:16,372 --> 00:35:19,903
But we should also keep that in mind that what I said about the best thing is to test it at the museum

528
00:35:19,903 --> 00:35:23,573
Because we have all had contact with loved ones there in some way.

529
00:35:24,176 --> 00:35:29,815
Even those who work there, Johan, Lennie and Thesso get something there.

530
00:35:31,053 --> 00:35:34,290
So I ask no one, Peter can you come in to us here?

531
00:35:39,462 --> 00:35:43,138
Do you remember that Tony would come along and sleep over?

532
00:35:44,217 --> 00:35:46,070
Where you slept your last night.

533
00:35:49,148 --> 00:35:52,275
- Do you remember that I would sleep over with you on Ringvägen?

534
00:35:54,940 --> 00:35:58,076
That Christmas night, or Christmas Eve.

535
00:35:58,960 --> 00:36:02,178
- Do you remember Johanna asked if you could sleep here?

536
00:36:03,511 --> 00:36:05,726
That you got to sleep over here instead of going home.

537
00:36:11,818 --> 00:36:14,970
And here I think it's so damn interesting with all this we do now.

538
00:36:15,510 --> 00:36:18,918
She says she has nothing here, we hardly get anything.

539
00:36:19,425 --> 00:36:22,396
But we get where we had our activity.

540
00:36:22,999 --> 00:36:24,547
It's pretty interesting.

541
00:36:25,562 --> 00:36:26,937
It feels like I want to go back there.

542
00:36:26,937 --> 00:36:27,983
- Should we try again then?

543
00:36:27,983 --> 00:36:32,687
- We can try to add any other instrument, not static or strap but a PMB.

544
00:36:33,353 --> 00:36:34,097
- We try it then.

545
00:36:34,097 --> 00:36:34,756
- We test it.

546
00:36:37,580 --> 00:36:38,755
Then we set it up.

547
00:36:39,072 --> 00:36:40,966
- Then you have to sit closest to there and we will see.

548
00:36:42,394 --> 00:36:43,403
We only run the PMB.

549
00:36:43,403 --> 00:36:44,379
- Yes, we start there.

550
00:36:48,948 --> 00:36:51,880
And as you can see, the first investigation we just sit in different places is.

551
00:36:52,324 --> 00:36:55,333
It is very difficult, we try

552
00:36:56,190 --> 00:36:59,093
Recreate as much as we can, because in this living room we sat.

553
00:36:59,728 --> 00:37:01,542
We sat a lot and watched TV here.

554
00:37:01,733 --> 00:37:03,676
We sat talking and busing.

555
00:37:03,676 --> 00:37:08,982
- The whole Christmas Eve we were really here, this is where we sat.

556
00:37:09,490 --> 00:37:12,233
So you think it's somewhere it could be ...

557
00:37:13,375 --> 00:37:15,040
A recognition factor

558
00:37:15,357 --> 00:37:17,174
that we still sit here at the table

559
00:37:18,640 --> 00:37:20,287
We are in the same place

560
00:37:21,334 --> 00:37:25,230
In that corner now there is a small box.

561
00:37:29,228 --> 00:37:31,403
Peter, if you were here before

562
00:37:32,799 --> 00:37:34,406
Can you come back again?

563
00:37:37,484 --> 00:37:40,124
- The PMB does not take static or REM function.

564
00:37:40,124 --> 00:37:43,590
It just runs on movement if there is something that passes

565
00:37:44,066 --> 00:37:45,557
of density in front of it.

566
00:37:46,826 --> 00:37:48,832
- It is also interesting with the tone we have.

567
00:37:49,086 --> 00:37:49,851
Do you notice it?

568
00:37:50,041 --> 00:37:51,942
We talk pretty quietly, pretty

569
00:37:52,228 --> 00:37:54,000
Almost like a library.

570
00:37:54,666 --> 00:37:58,217
It is not a higher volume, we keep fairly even

571
00:37:58,375 --> 00:38:02,102
Monoton's voice, I don't know what it is, if it's because we're just at home.

572
00:38:02,388 --> 00:38:03,169
"home"

573
00:38:03,835 --> 00:38:05,440
And talking to family.

574
00:38:05,440 --> 00:38:11,369
- I think this is built into our system in ourselves.

575
00:38:11,750 --> 00:38:14,632
You could have this tone here, otherwise it was heard down to the neighbor.

576
00:38:16,155 --> 00:38:19,965
I think so, you couldn't talk higher because then the neighbor started knocking or stomping.

577
00:38:20,758 --> 00:38:21,925
- Yes, it's a theory.

578
00:38:23,353 --> 00:38:29,706
- Admittedly, we were five, six children here plus parents and television.

579
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:32,324
It may also have been very alive.

580
00:38:34,577 --> 00:38:35,721
So in that corner

581
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:37,479
There were two guitars.

582
00:38:38,685 --> 00:38:41,227
And someone pulled on the strings on one guitar.

583
00:38:43,035 --> 00:38:46,378
Was it you Peter who did it when I was here myself?

584
00:38:52,026 --> 00:38:54,534
Get the PMB to play if it was you Peter, who did that.

585
00:38:56,025 --> 00:38:57,812
Or was it you Johanna, who did it?

586
00:38:58,605 --> 00:39:01,414
Because you would pay attention to me, that you are here.

587
00:39:08,173 --> 00:39:09,896
It is also so damn special.

588
00:39:10,150 --> 00:39:12,589
We have never done it this way before.

589
00:39:12,589 --> 00:39:15,314
We have never addressed our loved ones.

590
00:39:15,314 --> 00:39:16,396
- That they should come through.

591
00:39:18,744 --> 00:39:22,120
- We really only go to active, haunted houses.

592
00:39:22,945 --> 00:39:25,979
Where the client tells what happened.

593
00:39:26,582 --> 00:39:30,225
Then we have to search a little wider and ask much broader questions.

594
00:39:31,018 --> 00:39:32,585
But we don't want to do this.

595
00:39:33,568 --> 00:39:35,385
I don't want to do this at all.

596
00:39:36,972 --> 00:39:41,566
For I think the most important thing is if loved ones can get through stronger on

597
00:39:42,201 --> 00:39:44,627
An old memory site really, this apartment.

598
00:39:44,627 --> 00:39:47,749
And it was really a nostalgic trip we were involved today.

599
00:39:48,415 --> 00:39:49,945
It has been brutal.

600
00:39:51,214 --> 00:39:52,941
- That's what is interesting if you think ...

601
00:39:52,941 --> 00:39:54,344
- Do you know what I came up with?

602
00:39:54,788 --> 00:39:57,423
I think I saw a tennis ball on a floor here.

603
00:39:57,613 --> 00:40:00,105
I think if I put it on the table as we have a case here

604
00:40:00,327 --> 00:40:02,579
with a tennis ball.
 I go and pick it up.

605
00:40:03,341 --> 00:40:04,736
There is one here too.

606
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:07,944
A slightly larger tennis ball.

607
00:40:10,038 --> 00:40:12,740
There you can see that it also settled.

608
00:40:13,406 --> 00:40:14,605
- there we have a ball

609
00:40:14,859 --> 00:40:18,000
Who has thrown in this apartment several times when we lived here.

610
00:40:18,920 --> 00:40:21,960
Can the person who did it, throw this ball?

611
00:40:23,547 --> 00:40:25,868
Get it to move, roll down on the floor.

612
00:40:27,042 --> 00:40:29,088
- We have people we have met on here outside

613
00:40:29,501 --> 00:40:31,295
who live in apartments all around here

614
00:40:31,644 --> 00:40:32,929
that knows things.

615
00:40:33,405 --> 00:40:35,416
Is it in the ground?
 Because we are not far from the mine.

616
00:40:35,733 --> 00:40:37,718
- So it is, which is also a theory.

617
00:40:37,718 --> 00:40:41,145
But also what we felt initially when we came in here, but you do not know

618
00:40:41,145 --> 00:40:43,589
If it is because it is such a strongly charged place for us.

619
00:40:44,065 --> 00:40:48,908
It may not have to do with the paranormal, but more about the memories we have from here.

620
00:40:48,908 --> 00:40:52,882
You think about everything you have been through, so it gets stronger that way instead.

621
00:40:53,421 --> 00:40:56,925
And that may be the difficulty of being in the apartment right now as well.

622
00:40:57,560 --> 00:41:01,662
You do not know what it is you really feel, you become very

623
00:41:02,075 --> 00:41:05,859
drained, tired and a dizziness that you also felt before.

624
00:41:07,890 --> 00:41:12,614
Is it paranormal or for a natural cause just because we are here?

625
00:41:12,900 --> 00:41:15,907
And that we do something that we are not so used to.

626
00:41:15,907 --> 00:41:18,879
To actually seek contact with our own.

627
00:41:19,894 --> 00:41:24,935
- And what may make you hold back a little.

628
00:41:25,474 --> 00:41:28,053
It feels right to do this.

629
00:41:28,276 --> 00:41:31,351
Without them to come to one when they want to do it themselves.

630
00:41:31,351 --> 00:41:32,806
- but the interesting thing is that

631
00:41:33,504 --> 00:41:35,808
which we start to see here now litigran to

632
00:41:36,240 --> 00:41:37,466
We don't get much.

633
00:41:38,005 --> 00:41:40,782
When we address Peter, Johanna or Mom.

634
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:44,399
Although we lived here and spent a lot of time.

635
00:41:44,780 --> 00:41:46,037
In this apartment.

636
00:41:46,037 --> 00:41:48,730
But they will not come through this place.

637
00:41:49,809 --> 00:41:51,098
- No, not as strong as we thought.

638
00:41:51,098 --> 00:41:54,700
- We have had stronger, such as Empes.

639
00:41:55,493 --> 00:41:57,731
Abisko we thought partly as well.

640
00:41:58,207 --> 00:42:01,374
At the train station there, something happened.

641
00:42:03,944 --> 00:42:08,363
- But should we test a Ghost box as well and see if there is any voice or memories left.

642
00:42:08,807 --> 00:42:10,488
We get through ... so it started after all

643
00:42:10,996 --> 00:42:12,350
Fixed with spirit box.

644
00:42:12,984 --> 00:42:14,863
And the Ghost box is like a spirit box.

645
00:42:15,624 --> 00:42:19,119
And I think it's so interesting.
 Will Peter come through here?

646
00:42:20,102 --> 00:42:21,348
And say the same words again.

647
00:42:21,983 --> 00:42:23,285
- Would you recognize the voice then?

648
00:42:23,412 --> 00:42:28,064
- I think I would definitely recognize my voice, but that's the word I don't remember.

649
00:42:28,635 --> 00:42:29,675
But I start it.

650
00:42:30,200 --> 00:42:31,685
Peter, if you are here now

651
00:42:33,938 --> 00:42:36,000
Do you remember when Tony did this

652
00:42:36,730 --> 00:42:37,874
for the first time?

653
00:42:42,951 --> 00:42:43,718
- "Well"?!

654
00:42:49,049 --> 00:42:50,727
Okay Peter, then you hear us?

655
00:42:53,488 --> 00:42:54,700
Where are you now?

656
00:43:01,776 --> 00:43:02,753
- Johanna

657
00:43:03,292 --> 00:43:04,851
Can you come in to us now?

658
00:43:14,021 --> 00:43:14,702
Mother

659
00:43:14,702 --> 00:43:15,436
Irene

660
00:43:17,308 --> 00:43:21,197
We are in your old apartment, can you come here and say hello to us?

661
00:43:33,064 --> 00:43:34,622
Did it say "no I don't want to"?

662
00:43:36,317 --> 00:43:37,793
It is very difficult to hear.

663
00:43:38,491 --> 00:43:41,314
But then you also wonder if it was Peter who was there?

664
00:43:42,202 --> 00:43:43,820
I do not know...

665
00:43:47,818 --> 00:43:52,352
Had they been close now and been able to come through and say those words strongly.

666
00:43:52,701 --> 00:43:55,856
Just when we were trying to address them, it had been very interesting.

667
00:43:56,871 --> 00:43:58,731
We don't want to talk to anything else right now.

668
00:43:58,731 --> 00:44:00,000
I don't want anything else now.

669
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:02,625
- Not here, that's not why we're here today.

670
00:44:02,625 --> 00:44:06,498
In all other places we can address everything.

671
00:44:06,498 --> 00:44:09,136
But here we just want to get in touch with them.

672
00:44:09,136 --> 00:44:11,431
- And see if it is stronger on the site.

673
00:44:15,778 --> 00:44:18,948
But something that is very interesting is why it is just that corner.

674
00:44:19,900 --> 00:44:24,944
The guitars, the plaster figure, Jojon are from this place.

675
00:44:26,276 --> 00:44:28,235
- So there can be something else then.

676
00:44:28,965 --> 00:44:31,854
- It may have been a portal that has been there for any length of time.

677
00:44:31,854 --> 00:44:34,371
So that this is where the energies have come through as strongly.

678
00:44:39,607 --> 00:44:41,639
So this is also the case that when we sit here ...

679
00:44:42,242 --> 00:44:43,948
I feel this that

680
00:44:43,948 --> 00:44:46,074
In a way I'm glad they're not here now

681
00:44:46,074 --> 00:44:47,030
if you understand what I mean.

682
00:44:47,347 --> 00:44:50,232
That they can visit us when they want to.

683
00:44:50,232 --> 00:44:53,467
That is the feeling I get now and it is a lot of medium that says it too.

684
00:44:54,514 --> 00:44:57,327
Right now there are no memorial energy of them here either, I think.

685
00:44:57,560 --> 00:44:58,691
It's something

686
00:44:59,104 --> 00:45:02,735
Here that I think has something to do with the ground.

687
00:45:02,957 --> 00:45:04,883
But she does not disturb it who lives here.

688
00:45:05,549 --> 00:45:08,546
And I'm not going to ask for anything else to come in either.

689
00:45:09,847 --> 00:45:11,177
Nothing else.

690
00:45:11,812 --> 00:45:14,081
Without it, our loved ones we want

691
00:45:14,716 --> 00:45:16,232
talk to.

692
00:45:17,406 --> 00:45:19,009
What is happening now

693
00:45:19,358 --> 00:45:21,518
It also strengthens our theory a little.

694
00:45:22,248 --> 00:45:23,169
It becomes...

695
00:45:24,311 --> 00:45:25,998
It is quiet in a place where it is quiet.

696
00:45:27,204 --> 00:45:30,742
And we can say that when we are in contact with so much people

697
00:45:30,742 --> 00:45:32,515
that says they have activity at home

698
00:45:33,150 --> 00:45:34,520
Then we have it to go on.

699
00:45:35,250 --> 00:45:38,666
She said that we had to borrow the apartment but that she has a great time here.

700
00:45:39,079 --> 00:45:43,889
- So it wasn't really the apartment itself, but more an attempt to get it together.

701
00:45:43,889 --> 00:45:47,499
Does it get stronger?
 Can I get the contact we had with those phenomena?

702
00:45:47,499 --> 00:45:49,831
When we come in here, do we have something with us?

703
00:45:50,339 --> 00:45:52,301
No, not that way.

704
00:45:52,301 --> 00:45:53,474
Not here.

705
00:45:54,268 --> 00:45:55,925
Here they choose not to come through.

706
00:45:57,289 --> 00:45:59,186
- And this will be so interesting to test later.

707
00:45:59,440 --> 00:46:01,669
At the haunted museum.

708
00:46:01,986 --> 00:46:03,286
Where we know that

709
00:46:04,809 --> 00:46:07,268
Johan got such strong contact with loved ones.

710
00:46:08,093 --> 00:46:14,425
We have Johanna running there, but we have never addressed Peter or Morsan there.

711
00:46:14,869 --> 00:46:16,705
Where these objects are so strong.

712
00:46:17,594 --> 00:46:19,708
And there we can also address something else.

713
00:46:21,485 --> 00:46:25,117
And there it is usually the variables;
 Is it really you.

714
00:46:25,625 --> 00:46:26,846
To ask those questions.

715
00:46:27,163 --> 00:46:28,187
But we see here.

716
00:46:29,266 --> 00:46:30,344
Nothing.

717
00:46:31,359 --> 00:46:34,803
- and nice anyway for the one who lives here when we talked after this

718
00:46:35,216 --> 00:46:38,310
That it is calm, it is nothing here.

719
00:46:39,548 --> 00:46:43,051
Just as she confirms, and we can even with our theory say that

720
00:46:43,241 --> 00:46:46,459
No, there was no more activity because we went back to childhood home

721
00:46:46,459 --> 00:46:47,419
Where everything started.

722
00:46:49,704 --> 00:46:54,683
We get to round this up and do the experiment at the haunted museum.

723
00:47:04,560 --> 00:47:06,763
- If you sum up what we got to be with

724
00:47:06,763 --> 00:47:10,318
So we think it was Peter we got in touch with who answered us via the PRS.

725
00:47:13,142 --> 00:47:18,265
All activity came from the corner that was also an active place in the apartment when we lived there.

726
00:47:19,344 --> 00:47:21,682
Maybe it's a portal to something else.

727
00:47:22,080 --> 00:47:27,045
But it is important to remember that those who live here today do not know anything paranormal.

728
00:47:28,187 --> 00:47:31,840
The strongest message was what came through the Polterscrip.

729
00:47:31,840 --> 00:47:35,674
With the words "medicine", "sugar" and "49 years".

730
00:47:36,975 --> 00:47:39,573
All these words are well in line with Niclas

731
00:47:39,573 --> 00:47:43,426
who just been told to be close to type 2 diabetes.

732
00:47:45,742 --> 00:47:48,733
What we can conclude after this investigation

733
00:47:48,733 --> 00:47:52,455
is that it doesn't matter where you are to get in touch with your loved ones.

734
00:47:54,677 --> 00:47:57,760
The contact does not get stronger in a specific location.

735
00:47:57,760 --> 00:48:01,903
The contact can be established wherever you are.
