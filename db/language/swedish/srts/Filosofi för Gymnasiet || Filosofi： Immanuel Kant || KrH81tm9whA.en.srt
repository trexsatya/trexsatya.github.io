1
00:00:02,200 --> 00:00:08,140
Imagine a little guy whose daily walks were so punctual that you can set the clock after them.

2
00:00:08,900 --> 00:00:15,780
Immanuel Kant was a German philosopher from Königsberg, a city Germany losing to the Soviet Union

3
00:00:15,780 --> 00:00:20,140
After World War II and then renamed Kaliningrad.

4
00:00:22,740 --> 00:00:26,460
Immanuel Kant was to the exterior a very unassuming man,

5
00:00:26,460 --> 00:00:31,060
But philosophically, he undoubtedly belongs to the greatest.

6
00:00:31,280 --> 00:00:35,860
He is for philosophy what Newton is for physics or Darwin for biology -

7
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:42,380
Creator of a theory that all descendants must relate to, whether he agreed with him or not.

8
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:48,260
Kant himself meant that his philosophy was a "Copernican revolution" -

9
00:00:48,260 --> 00:00:54,080
comparable to what Nicolaus Copernicus achieved in astronomy during the 16th century

10
00:00:54,080 --> 00:00:59,240
By assuming that the sun, not the earth, was the center of the universe.

11
00:01:00,020 --> 00:01:05,960
So far, Kant meant, assumed that our knowledge must adhere to the objects.

12
00:01:05,960 --> 00:01:11,460
But that is not the case.
 It is the objects that adhere to our knowledge ability.

13
00:01:12,420 --> 00:01:17,480
In this section, we will take a closer look at Kant's theory of knowledge.

14
00:01:18,420 --> 00:01:25,240
His view of ethics (Kant was duty ethicist and formulated, among other things, the categorical imperative)

15
00:01:25,240 --> 00:01:28,380
Treated under Chapter 3: Ethics and Morality.

16
00:01:29,500 --> 00:01:31,680
So what is the theory of knowledge?

17
00:01:31,980 --> 00:01:40,340
Knowledge theory, or epistemology (from the Greek episteme, "knowledge"), is the doctrine of knowledge.

18
00:01:40,860 --> 00:01:46,280
Here you examine boundaries and conditions for knowledge and ask questions such as

19
00:01:46,280 --> 00:01:50,540
"How do we get knowledge" or "How do we know that knowledge is true"?

20
00:01:51,180 --> 00:01:57,140
Already Plato devoted himself to these issues and he defined knowledge as "true justified faith"

21
00:01:57,340 --> 00:02:03,320
Based on the view that knowledge is that person A knows X about and only about:

22
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:05,280
X is true.

23
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:08,380
A is convinced that X is true.

24
00:02:08,760 --> 00:02:12,140
A has good reasons for believing that X is true.

25
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:17,460
Thus, there are historically three necessary requirements for knowledge.

26
00:02:17,900 --> 00:02:25,020
By definition, this means that there is no incorrect knowledge, only knowledge or error.

27
00:02:25,380 --> 00:02:31,440
Traditionally, knowledge theorists are divided into two camps;
 Empirists and rationalists.

28
00:02:31,700 --> 00:02:36,000
According to empiricism, all knowledge is founded in sensation experience,

29
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:39,560
A reasoning that can be traced back to Aristotle.

30
00:02:40,060 --> 00:02:47,380
Empiri is based on scientific studies of reality, observations and experiments,

31
00:02:47,620 --> 00:02:53,280
rather than on pre -set theories or philosophical reasoning.

32
00:02:53,760 --> 00:03:01,540
A rationalist, on the other hand, claims that knowledge of the world originates from reason, thinking and congenital ideas

33
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:05,780
(Although sensory experience may of course be involved).

34
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:11,320
It is believed that the sensations are too unreliable to constitute knowledge,

35
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:17,660
A reasoning that is well exemplified by René Descartes and his systematic doubt.

36
00:03:18,140 --> 00:03:22,800
What Kant is trying to find is the limit of human knowledge.

37
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:29,060
His reasoning can be seen as an attempt to preserve the best out both empirism and rationalism,

38
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:33,580
While taking into account the criticism they directed at each other.

39
00:03:33,940 --> 00:03:39,420
This is a theory of knowledge often called critical or transcendental idealism.

40
00:03:39,820 --> 00:03:46,680
According to Kant, one must distinguish between two kinds of knowledge: experience knowledge and reasonable knowledge.

41
00:03:47,260 --> 00:03:52,440
Experience knowledge (or empirical knowledge) is something whose truth

42
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:55,680
We cannot know without reference to experience.

43
00:03:56,100 --> 00:04:00,160
An example of this is that Paris is the capital of France.

44
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:05,660
We know this from experience - we have learned it by using our minds

45
00:04:05,740 --> 00:04:09,320
For example, we have read it in a book or heard it from our parents.

46
00:04:10,260 --> 00:04:17,440
This type of knowledge calls Kant "a posteriori", which means after experience.

47
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:23,360
He calls the second type of knowledge "a priori", before experience.

48
00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:30,580
This is knowledge we have without reference to the experience - for example, 5+7 = 12.

49
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:35,580
In mathematics, for example, we use reason to determine what is true.

50
00:04:35,580 --> 00:04:38,600
But how can such knowledge be possible?

51
00:04:39,980 --> 00:04:45,460
Kant replies that Knowledge A Priori is not based on the world that surrounds us,

52
00:04:45,460 --> 00:04:49,720
Without how our consciousness is organized and works.

53
00:04:50,100 --> 00:04:53,420
Here, Kant also points to the limitation of knowledge.

54
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:59,560
He initiates the book "Criticism of Pure Reason" (1781) by claiming

55
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:05,480
“That all our knowledge begins with the experience, there is no doubt at all [...]

56
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:12,600
But even if all our knowledge begins with the experience, it does not arise from the experience. "

57
00:05:13,020 --> 00:05:18,000
Everything we perceive - whether it is mind impressions, feelings, thoughts or memories -

58
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:26,620
We perceive through our body's knowledge organ;
 Our five senses, our brain and our central nervous system.

59
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:30,900
Everything that these organs can sense can therefore be experienced,

60
00:05:30,900 --> 00:05:36,160
While eventualities they cannot deal with can never be perceived by us.

61
00:05:36,620 --> 00:05:43,400
Our knowledge of the world is thus limited by what our senses, brain and nervous system can handle.

62
00:05:43,820 --> 00:05:49,280
Thus, on the one hand, there is what exists regardless of us and our perception

63
00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:51,820
(the objective reality)

64
00:05:52,040 --> 00:05:57,640
And on the other hand, what we have the opportunity to perceive (the human interpretation of reality).

65
00:05:58,460 --> 00:06:03,640
There is no reason to believe that these two types of existence are the same.

66
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:08,900
There is almost certainly much less of the latter than the former.

67
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:14,820
In addition, there is a "filter" between each human and the objective outer world.

68
00:06:14,820 --> 00:06:19,600
Which allows us to only interpret reality - never really experience it.

69
00:06:20,020 --> 00:06:24,660
This filter can be likened to a pair of colored glasses for reason.

70
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:31,620
In the same way as a pair of blue -colored glasses, reality is perceived as blue -tinted,

71
00:06:31,620 --> 00:06:38,560
perceives reason reality as spatial, timely and causal (causal)

72
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:41,820
- Something edge calls views.

73
00:06:42,580 --> 00:06:47,280
We cannot possibly have experiences decoupled from the views.

74
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:55,880
This, like a priori knowledge, which also forces our impressions in order to understand them for us.

75
00:06:56,240 --> 00:07:03,480
Time and space are like our experience of colors - they are not in reality, they are only mental constructions.

76
00:07:03,980 --> 00:07:11,900
Kant himself expresses this as “thoughts without content are empty;
 Observations without concepts are blind ”.

77
00:07:12,420 --> 00:07:17,340
Edge thus distinguishes between the thing itself that exists in reality as it is

78
00:07:17,340 --> 00:07:23,340
Regardless of our interpretation of the (by Kanten named Noumenon), and the thing for me

79
00:07:23,340 --> 00:07:30,840
- The human interpretation / filtration / experience of a thing (by Kant named the phenomenon world).

80
00:07:31,240 --> 00:07:36,180
Of these, only the phenomenon world we can have knowledge or experience about.

81
00:07:36,460 --> 00:07:41,720
What is beyond our experience of the world we have no opportunity to know.

82
00:07:42,060 --> 00:07:47,500
This means, according to Kant, that we will never be able to reach knowledge of, for example

83
00:07:47,500 --> 00:07:50,520
God's existence or free will.

84
00:07:51,220 --> 00:07:56,860
Kant himself expressed this as that he excluded the knowledge to leave room for faith.

85
00:07:57,100 --> 00:08:02,400
Kant's theory of knowledge has been of great importance to philosophy when he was thrown out

86
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:07,120
All so -called "evidence" for (or against) for example God's existence.

87
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:14,000
Since Kantt's time, among philosophers has been virtually generally accepted that certain issues

88
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:18,120
is beyond what man can theoretically have knowledge of.

89
00:08:18,580 --> 00:08:25,760
Kantts thus describes how both the natural sciences (phenomena world) as well as metaphysical

90
00:08:25,760 --> 00:08:34,240
Issues and religion (Noumenon) can coexist without any mutual contradiction.

91
00:08:34,980 --> 00:08:40,860
He also shows that there is a clearly defined boundary between knowledge and faith.
