1
00:00:04.383 --> 00:00:07.530
We move on here.

2
00:00:07.580 --> 00:00:10.524
We'll see a little bit on how we have been thinking

3
00:00:10.582 --> 00:00:12.590
to post this guidance work.

4
00:00:12.641 --> 00:00:15.946
It is very much experience and a lot of reflections

5
00:00:15.997 --> 00:00:19.110
from these events and we see that there are wishes

6
00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:23.030
at very many different levels within rescue service

7
00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:27.380
And to get guidance for their role.

8
00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:31.670
This has very much ruled us in the disposition of this guidance

9
00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:34.530
and it has become very extensive for that reason

10
00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:37.370
that we want as well as a part that will fit each

11
00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:39.420
With different backgrounds and needs.

12
00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:45.250
After all, we have in the run -up of this guidance work,

13
00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:47.300
When we have looked at ...

14
00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:49.890
We must have answers to questions because we have not found

15
00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:52.710
this internationally and we have really searched

16
00:00:52.761 --> 00:00:55.710
And preferably we probably would have just been able to translate to Swedish something

17
00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:57.858
As someone else had done that had been good,

18
00:00:57.909 --> 00:01:00.380
But unfortunately it was not there.

19
00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:03.470
So we've received help

20
00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:07.450
and we announced a study to obtain computational data

21
00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:10.330
For all the questions we need answers to.

22
00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:13.530
So, we can have a sense of how long jet flames become,

23
00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:16.110
We can have a feeling for how far splits fly

24
00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:19.670
and how far away you get your hearing injured and so on

25
00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:23.620
and how dangerous gas cloudsxplosions are in tunnels,

26
00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:28.630
But we can't determine this just because of gut feeling,

27
00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:31.413
For this we have to base on something.

28
00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:34.637
Otherwise it is not credible for MSB to publish a guide

29
00:01:34.688 --> 00:01:36.850
If we have nothing to build on.

30
00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:39.160
So this we have tried to do with

31
00:01:39.211 --> 00:01:42.970
The best calculation tools actually on the market.

32
00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:46.390
This is made with tools that are designed for

33
00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:49.107
This particular type of CFD calculations then.

34
00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:52.830
So that ground we have in the back since

35
00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:54.970
When we go in and recommend.

36
00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:57.690
Then in terms of LPG, ie this type of vehicle

37
00:01:57.740 --> 00:01:59.910
that is powered by propanbutan mixtures, -

38
00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:03.430
Then this is already done in the US market,

39
00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:05.914
So then we have not put money into it, but there we have only

40
00:02:05.973 --> 00:02:10.104
Picked up the experiences for these few vehicles that it is about.

41
00:02:10.419 --> 00:02:12.730
There we have taken it home that way.

42
00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:16.170
So this is a little bit the background.
 We have lots of experiences,

43
00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:21.070
We have calculations, both as we ourselves have made

44
00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:23.310
and calculations that we have been able to pick home

45
00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:25.427
from the scientific world.

46
00:02:26.205 --> 00:02:28.225
What do you do with this then

47
00:02:28.276 --> 00:02:31.520
Yes, this must be accepted by all actors.

48
00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:34.230
We have therefore started a broad collaboration

49
00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:36.547
by anchoring this guidance.

50
00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:41.770
Of course, this is nothing that one shakes out of the cuff arm

51
00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:44.850
Without us having picked up the academy with us.

52
00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:48.310
We have Lund University of Technology and UmeÃ¥ University

53
00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:51.360
Which has helped us a lot in the traffic accident area before.

54
00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:55.670
After all, we have people with testing experience from RISE.

55
00:02:55.720 --> 00:03:01.379
We have made attempts and we have obtained material from them

56
00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:04.690
And we have had them in the group.
 We have included the automotive industry,

57
00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:10.350
thus from industry organizations to our big -

58
00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:15.090
truck manufacturers in the country and also other vehicle manufacturers

59
00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:18.830
After all, they have been involved to some extent, where we have needed answers to questions.

60
00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:23.690
And we have been very much based on the worst tank of the market,

61
00:03:23.740 --> 00:03:29.790
the market's worst size of gas leakage and so on

62
00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:33.830
from pressure equalization devices and other things for us to be

63
00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:36.170
on the safe side of our recommendations.

64
00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:38.890
Then it may be that sometimes there are less tank sizes

65
00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:43.530
and maybe less risks, but it gets too plot

66
00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:46.050
If we are to have a guidance for each vehicle,

67
00:03:46.100 --> 00:03:49.172
Without it we must be able to group them into different groups.

68
00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:54.700
Rescue services are important.
 Petter, thank you for your efforts.

69
00:03:54.896 --> 00:03:57.869
It wasn't just me.
 No, it's not just you, -

70
00:03:57.944 --> 00:04:00.070
Without that we have tried to bring people with

71
00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:03.570
both from the part -time side and experience from there

72
00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:06.870
and to the larger rescue services that have very,

73
00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:10.330
What to say, troublesome social disorders

74
00:04:10.380 --> 00:04:12.850
when accidents get in their inner cities.

75
00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:15.210
That is why we have brought with us Greater Stockholm of course,

76
00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:18.971
Which has a lot of experience and Uppsala fire defense as well.

77
00:04:19.480 --> 00:04:22.168
They have a little more resources and they can help us a little easier

78
00:04:22.219 --> 00:04:24.815
than maybe a very small rescue service, so it is not

79
00:04:24.866 --> 00:04:28.990
to try to withhold the problems of small rescue services

80
00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:31.040
And challenges.

81
00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:36.430
When it comes to the energy bakes, we have mixed in the energy industry

82
00:04:36.480 --> 00:04:41.050
through its industry organizations primarily and it is hydrogen Sweden

83
00:04:41.100 --> 00:04:43.630
and Energigas Sweden with which we capture them,

84
00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:47.010
But we have also taken in Gasum when it comes to LNG,

85
00:04:47.060 --> 00:04:50.500
Because they have more technical knowledge about their systems then.

86
00:04:51.660 --> 00:04:54.710
Other authorities are also important that we have with us.

87
00:04:54.760 --> 00:05:00.780
FOI we have given the assignment for external monitoring.

88
00:05:01.440 --> 00:05:03.570
We have balled some questions with them.

89
00:05:03.620 --> 00:05:07.010
The Swedish Transport Administration is very affected when this happens

90
00:05:07.060 --> 00:05:09.830
In our infrastructure in tunnels and so on

91
00:05:09.880 --> 00:05:13.848
That we have them with us, so that we do not miss important aspects.

92
00:05:13.960 --> 00:05:18.330
The Swedish Transport Agency that approves vehicles and has that vehicle knowledge

93
00:05:18.380 --> 00:05:20.730
As we need them too are important

94
00:05:20.780 --> 00:05:23.180
To get statistics and so on from.

95
00:05:23.400 --> 00:05:25.470
Then this is a lot of work environment issues,

96
00:05:25.520 --> 00:05:29.010
So if we need help from any authority

97
00:05:29.060 --> 00:05:33.604
So it is often the Swedish Work Environment Authority to be able to interpret their regulations.

98
00:05:33.800 --> 00:05:37.310
For the idea is that when we make recommendations for zoning,

99
00:05:37.360 --> 00:05:40.850
that the protective equipment that we intend to use

100
00:05:40.900 --> 00:05:44.847
In these zones are also the most appropriate in their eyes,

101
00:05:44.898 --> 00:05:48.250
so that we have tried to build a team

102
00:05:48.300 --> 00:05:52.230
To solve this task, which is quite powerful

103
00:05:52.280 --> 00:05:56.570
And it is for this to lead to a consensus,

104
00:05:56.620 --> 00:06:01.190
that this is the best possible technology in events

105
00:06:01.240 --> 00:06:07.630
And that this is substantiated.
 There has been too much guessing game

106
00:06:07.680 --> 00:06:11.456
And assessments in the past and that is why we have landed in this.

107
00:06:11.740 --> 00:06:13.740
What was the result then, Erik

108
00:06:15.200 --> 00:06:17.467
Yes, it became this guidance.

109
00:06:17.720 --> 00:06:19.720
It is divided into three parts.

110
00:06:20.040 --> 00:06:23.120
Part 1: Background and facts.

111
00:06:23.480 --> 00:06:28.130
This part enables in -depth knowledge and adaptations locally

112
00:06:28.180 --> 00:06:33.250
and it also contains a lot of footnotes and references

113
00:06:33.300 --> 00:06:36.360
To places where you can read more.

114
00:06:37.080 --> 00:06:39.480
The tactical guidance.

115
00:06:40.240 --> 00:06:43.670
It contains recommendations for the entire rescue management system

116
00:06:43.720 --> 00:06:48.260
And it also has the perspective both before, during and after accidents.

117
00:06:48.640 --> 00:06:51.790
It is to be able to get both preparation

118
00:06:51.840 --> 00:06:54.240
And the aftermath when the accident is complete.

119
00:06:55.860 --> 00:07:01.630
Part 3, it is an operational method support, which focuses on intervention management

120
00:07:01.680 --> 00:07:05.670
and task management and it can be spread more broadly

121
00:07:05.720 --> 00:07:07.987
to all rescue service personnel.
