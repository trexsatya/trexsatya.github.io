1
00:00:02,048 --> 00:00:08,192
Welcome to international author scene Gothenburg here at the City Library where I will

2
00:00:08,448 --> 00:00:09,728
Talk to Helle Helle!

3
00:00:09,984 --> 00:00:11,776
And my name is Annina Rabe

4
00:00:14,848 --> 00:00:17,152
I am very happy to sit here with you for I

5
00:00:17,408 --> 00:00:19,200
have read you very long

6
00:00:19,456 --> 00:00:21,504
And like your books very much.

7
00:00:23,552 --> 00:00:29,440
As we sat here outside and talked before we started

8
00:00:30,208 --> 00:00:35,584
Said your publisher Lisa, your Swedish publisher, something very good.

9
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:41,984
We talked about the translations of your books.

10
00:00:42,240 --> 00:00:47,616
I will also say that Helle Helle's books are translated here in Sweden by Ninni Holmqvist, which is a fantastic

11
00:00:47,872 --> 00:00:52,736
Good translator.
 Then Lisa said like this:

12
00:00:56,576 --> 00:00:58,880
Seemingly but difficult.

13
00:01:00,672 --> 00:01:03,232
Then I thought, that is something that

14
00:01:03,744 --> 00:01:04,512
somehow

15
00:01:04,768 --> 00:01:09,376
A little sums up your entire authorship, in a way.

16
00:01:09,632 --> 00:01:12,448
Because it is very difficult

17
00:01:12,704 --> 00:01:14,752
that is treated though

18
00:01:15,264 --> 00:01:18,336
Most of it is under the surface.

19
00:01:22,432 --> 00:01:27,808
I thought we'll start by talking about your last book,

20
00:01:28,064 --> 00:01:29,088
“Bob” as

21
00:01:29,344 --> 00:01:31,648
Recently, here in the days, came out in Swedish.

22
00:01:31,904 --> 00:01:37,792
But that we will also come into the book that came before Bob.

23
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:43,936
They are interconnected in a way and that is the book "they"

24
00:01:44,192 --> 00:01:44,704
that came

25
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:45,472
for

26
00:01:45,728 --> 00:01:47,008
2 years ago.

27
00:01:49,568 --> 00:01:50,848
This with seemingly

28
00:01:51,104 --> 00:01:54,944
Hard but simple?
 Or seemingly simple but hard, is that something you

29
00:01:55,712 --> 00:01:58,272
Can agree with or?

30
00:01:58,784 --> 00:01:59,552
For me

31
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:03,963
Is it simple.
 And not difficult.

32
00:02:05,184 --> 00:02:06,208
I think...

33
00:02:06,976 --> 00:02:07,744
Do you understand me?

34
00:02:09,536 --> 00:02:16,192
I think if it is a reader, when I sit and write,

35
00:02:16,192 --> 00:02:19,271
So I think it should be easy for the reader.

36
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:23,054
So that the reader will understand what I understand.

37
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:24,384
But

38
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:28,157
At the same time I can see that

39
00:02:29,350 --> 00:02:31,892
all that is all about

40
00:02:33,344 --> 00:02:35,381
is not what stands

41
00:02:35,648 --> 00:02:38,316
Without perhaps what does not stand.

42
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:42,560
It's because I avoid writing about emotions.

43
00:02:43,584 --> 00:02:45,376
It's so hard for me.

44
00:02:45,888 --> 00:02:49,984
That I became a writer

45
00:02:49,984 --> 00:02:51,776
and writes the books I make

46
00:02:52,544 --> 00:02:59,823
is because I discovered that you do not have to write about emotions.

47
00:02:59,823 --> 00:03:04,558
But that they are in everything we do

48
00:03:04,558 --> 00:03:05,892
and says.

49
00:03:06,112 --> 00:03:11,744
I just read an interview with you that you say "all my books are about emotions"

50
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:12,768
But

51
00:03:15,584 --> 00:03:17,120
At a first read

52
00:03:17,632 --> 00:03:20,192
Maybe it can be difficult to detect those emotions?

53
00:03:20,448 --> 00:03:23,264
But that is why I want you to notice,

54
00:03:24,032 --> 00:03:25,824
Thus, sense what is happening.

55
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:31,712
The people I write about

56
00:03:32,224 --> 00:03:34,016
Don't know what they feel.

57
00:03:34,272 --> 00:03:43,893
There is a kind of break or wait, perhaps a longing to reach it

58
00:03:44,256 --> 00:03:45,609
you feel.

59
00:03:46,048 --> 00:03:49,175
Which may therefore be difficult for me to write.

60
00:03:49,467 --> 00:03:51,168
But as a starting point I think that

61
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:57,827
the way novels are being read in is often not the same way as the writer

62
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:00,128
Looking at the novel, that's how it is for me.

63
00:04:06,528 --> 00:04:10,624
When I write I think a lot about

64
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:11,904
every

65
00:04:12,672 --> 00:04:13,952
sentence.

66
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:16,512
Not because I am

67
00:04:17,024 --> 00:04:18,815
Perfectionist, or I am!

68
00:04:19,071 --> 00:04:21,953
But one should be

69
00:04:22,399 --> 00:04:28,543
When writing, otherwise it is pointless

70
00:04:28,799 --> 00:04:33,249
But often it is a kind

71
00:04:33,407 --> 00:04:36,479
Association from meaning to meaning.

72
00:04:36,479 --> 00:04:39,077
It's a lot so I work.

73
00:04:39,551 --> 00:04:45,695
Your prose is also very associative.

74
00:04:45,951 --> 00:04:52,095
Often you are described as a minimalist and this I know that you have been against yourself,

75
00:04:52,351 --> 00:04:54,143
to be called minimalist.

76
00:04:54,655 --> 00:04:55,935
But

77
00:04:56,959 --> 00:04:58,495
If you say ...

78
00:04:58,751 --> 00:05:03,103
If you turn it around, you could say it's very ...

79
00:05:04,383 --> 00:05:11,579
There are prose that wastes a lot with the words and you don't.
 You are very frugal with the words.

80
00:05:12,063 --> 00:05:14,879
That you are a perfectionist is very clear,

81
00:05:15,135 --> 00:05:18,463
There is not a single word that is there

82
00:05:19,231 --> 00:05:23,923
By chance, you get a feeling when you read your books.

83
00:05:23,923 --> 00:05:25,923
It may sound a little scary!

84
00:05:28,167 --> 00:05:34,128
It may be a little dead about

85
00:05:34,128 --> 00:05:38,617
Every word, you can almost get anxiety if you are to read something you imagine has meaning and meaning in everything.

86
00:05:44,063 --> 00:05:45,343
And that is not the meaning

87
00:05:46,367 --> 00:05:51,999
That it should be so.
 And it is true that I do not perceive myself as a minimalist.

88
00:05:52,255 --> 00:05:54,303
I have never understood how to

89
00:05:54,559 --> 00:05:56,607
Write minimalist books.

90
00:05:57,119 --> 00:05:59,935
I understand better minimalism in visual arts

91
00:06:00,703 --> 00:06:01,215
but

92
00:06:02,239 --> 00:06:04,799
minimalism is not

93
00:06:05,567 --> 00:06:07,103
That you don't say everything?

94
00:06:07,359 --> 00:06:07,871
Is it?

95
00:06:08,383 --> 00:06:13,779
So you see that there is very little and below it is very

96
00:06:15,551 --> 00:06:19,903
But I think a minimalism is often about removing psychology

97
00:06:20,927 --> 00:06:22,975
And my books are about psychology

98
00:06:23,743 --> 00:06:27,396
They are psychology, it feels like.

99
00:06:27,583 --> 00:06:28,095
Yes

100
00:06:28,863 --> 00:06:34,186
And that is very much the case for "Bob" which is your latest book

101
00:06:38,335 --> 00:06:43,455
For those of you who haven't been able to read "Bob" yet can we start by telling it it has

102
00:06:44,223 --> 00:06:47,295
A very special storytelling structure

103
00:06:48,063 --> 00:06:49,855
The main character,

104
00:06:50,111 --> 00:06:53,951
It's one of my questions by the way, who is the main character?

105
00:06:56,255 --> 00:06:57,791
Because it tells about Bob,

106
00:06:58,559 --> 00:07:01,887
This young guy Bob, young man Bob,

107
00:07:02,399 --> 00:07:02,911
but

108
00:07:03,167 --> 00:07:05,983
The one who tells his story is his girlfriend.

109
00:07:06,239 --> 00:07:10,591
So the whole story is told through the girlfriend, even in

110
00:07:11,103 --> 00:07:14,943
Situations that she absolutely cannot have been with.

111
00:07:14,943 --> 00:07:19,551
Tell us a little about how it turned out it became this one

112
00:07:19,807 --> 00:07:22,367
Very special storytelling technology?

113
00:07:25,183 --> 00:07:26,975
The books I write,

114
00:07:27,231 --> 00:07:30,815
"They" and "Bob" but also the coming

115
00:07:31,071 --> 00:07:32,095
ahead,

116
00:07:32,607 --> 00:07:35,167
There I try

117
00:07:36,191 --> 00:07:37,983
To let the language

118
00:07:40,031 --> 00:07:40,799
tell

119
00:07:41,311 --> 00:07:44,639
The mood, explain, tell the outcome.

120
00:07:44,895 --> 00:07:52,662
Or leave the form part of the action.

121
00:07:52,831 --> 00:07:57,550
So that the way it is written on

122
00:07:58,207 --> 00:08:00,511
Also says something

123
00:08:00,511 --> 00:08:03,174
About what the book is about.

124
00:08:03,583 --> 00:08:07,935
So the idea of "Bob" was that if the narrator, his girlfriend,

125
00:08:08,191 --> 00:08:09,727
just tells you about Bob

126
00:08:09,983 --> 00:08:12,031
and not about oneself

127
00:08:12,208 --> 00:08:18,175
So she becomes more absent and at the same time more present.

128
00:08:18,175 --> 00:08:20,223
And that's what the book is about.

129
00:08:20,735 --> 00:08:22,527
That they are on their way apart

130
00:08:22,783 --> 00:08:26,594
but that it is a great sadness

131
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:27,647
The covenant with it

132
00:08:27,903 --> 00:08:31,743
But also a distance that extends throughout the book.

133
00:08:31,999 --> 00:08:34,892
She's just talking about him,

134
00:08:34,892 --> 00:08:36,892
she distant herself

135
00:08:37,375 --> 00:08:39,423
and I perceive that as

136
00:08:39,935 --> 00:08:44,429
A kind of act of love.

137
00:08:45,055 --> 00:08:47,103
That she does it, that she lets Bob ...

138
00:08:47,359 --> 00:08:50,000
She gives him the stage.

139
00:08:50,175 --> 00:08:50,687
But

140
00:08:50,943 --> 00:08:52,735
she might also manipulate

141
00:08:53,503 --> 00:08:55,039
Because she decides

142
00:08:55,295 --> 00:08:56,575
What it should say about him.

143
00:08:56,831 --> 00:08:58,517
And she decides

144
00:08:59,391 --> 00:09:02,207
What will happen to him when she is not there.

145
00:09:02,207 --> 00:09:06,047
And there you play a little bare all the time a splash

146
00:09:06,303 --> 00:09:09,375
with the reader.
 Somewhere in the middle of the book you become ...

147
00:09:11,679 --> 00:09:15,519
How much can I trust this narrator?
 Can i believe that this

148
00:09:15,775 --> 00:09:18,040
Is it happening Bob?

149
00:09:18,040 --> 00:09:21,151
We can never really know that.

150
00:09:21,151 --> 00:09:25,759
No, but another attempt was ...

151
00:09:26,271 --> 00:09:28,319
What I wanted was that I was thinking

152
00:09:28,575 --> 00:09:29,343
Can you have

153
00:09:29,599 --> 00:09:32,159
A storyteller who just says

154
00:09:32,415 --> 00:09:32,927
"I"

155
00:09:33,183 --> 00:09:33,951
once?

156
00:09:34,975 --> 00:09:38,548
And the rest of the time she is just like a “we”

157
00:09:38,815 --> 00:09:40,495
Together with Bob

158
00:09:42,143 --> 00:09:45,215
I thought, can you do

159
00:09:45,727 --> 00:09:47,263
A pronoun

160
00:09:48,287 --> 00:09:50,079
full of feeling?

161
00:09:51,615 --> 00:09:55,455
In one place in "Bob" it stands,

162
00:09:55,455 --> 00:09:55,967
“my”

163
00:09:56,991 --> 00:10:00,063
My Chinese shoes, what is it in Swedish?

164
00:10:01,343 --> 00:10:05,183
It is a reference to “they”

165
00:10:05,439 --> 00:10:06,975
but the word “mine”

166
00:10:07,231 --> 00:10:09,279
from the narrator's side

167
00:10:09,791 --> 00:10:13,887
is not in any other place.

168
00:10:14,655 --> 00:10:18,495
I was going to ask you to read a paragraph out of "Bob"

169
00:10:19,007 --> 00:10:21,823
So you can get a sense of the book.

170
00:10:22,079 --> 00:10:24,639
I take from the first page.

171
00:10:25,919 --> 00:10:28,735
It is also difficult in Danish.

172
00:10:30,015 --> 00:10:32,831
I might bring out the glasses ... No, they are gone!

173
00:10:35,647 --> 00:10:38,463
Out Move Bob and I to Vanlöse,

174
00:10:38,975 --> 00:10:41,279
Our home lay on top of the station,

175
00:10:41,535 --> 00:10:43,327
And we had a rod parquet.

176
00:10:44,095 --> 00:10:46,143
Up and down the stairs it went,

177
00:10:46,655 --> 00:10:48,191
Bob wore almost everything.

178
00:10:48,703 --> 00:10:49,471
Cardboard boxes,

179
00:10:49,727 --> 00:10:51,007
Classes and bags.

180
00:10:51,775 --> 00:10:53,567
All the time any of us said:

181
00:10:53,823 --> 00:10:55,615
How much luck can you have?

182
00:10:56,383 --> 00:10:59,455
The apartment was one with a balcony.

183
00:11:01,247 --> 00:11:04,831
In the plant road we had a yuccapalm, a homecoming,

184
00:11:05,599 --> 00:11:06,623
a cactus,

185
00:11:06,879 --> 00:11:07,903
A Benjamin Fikus.

186
00:11:08,927 --> 00:11:11,487
The homemade grew in half a coconut,

187
00:11:11,999 --> 00:11:14,559
A farewell gift from Bob's little brother.

188
00:11:15,583 --> 00:11:18,399
The inventory consisted of a flap table with chairs,

189
00:11:18,655 --> 00:11:19,935
One and forty-bed.

190
00:11:20,447 --> 00:11:23,263
Agency and floor lamp and more.

191
00:11:23,775 --> 00:11:25,567
Nothing to the walls,

192
00:11:26,079 --> 00:11:28,383
Bob thought about hanging up a towel,

193
00:11:28,639 --> 00:11:30,175
A special purple

194
00:11:30,431 --> 00:11:32,991
With braid patterns of tapestry character.

195
00:11:33,759 --> 00:11:34,527
Screw legs

196
00:11:34,783 --> 00:11:35,295
on

197
00:11:35,551 --> 00:11:36,831
Table and mediates on bed.

198
00:11:38,111 --> 00:11:42,719
But we left everything in a single mess and went out and sat in the late afternoon sun.

199
00:11:43,487 --> 00:11:45,023
We sat on the same chair.

200
00:11:46,047 --> 00:11:47,839
Bob saw maybe a tern,

201
00:11:48,863 --> 00:11:51,423
The women's house is just behind.

202
00:11:52,447 --> 00:11:54,495
He put his beer on the back of the hand,

203
00:11:55,007 --> 00:11:56,287
grabbed it in time.

204
00:11:57,055 --> 00:11:58,335
The balcony echoed,

205
00:11:58,591 --> 00:12:00,127
It was the eighteenth of August.

206
00:12:00,639 --> 00:12:02,175
Bob loved

207
00:12:02,431 --> 00:12:02,943
Yellow brick.

208
00:12:08,575 --> 00:12:14,719
Then maybe I, to clarify a little neighbor, can read it all

209
00:12:14,975 --> 00:12:17,791
First sentence in Swedish.

210
00:12:18,559 --> 00:12:24,959
It is very special and when we talked about your translations, this

211
00:12:24,959 --> 00:12:31,103
Is really a challenge for translators.
 I read an English translation of just this first paragraph

212
00:12:32,895 --> 00:12:36,223
They had not managed to get this very, very

213
00:12:36,479 --> 00:12:40,575
Special Tempus Switch I would say is pretty

214
00:12:40,831 --> 00:12:43,135
Typical of your authorship.

215
00:12:43,903 --> 00:12:47,999
You work a lot with both tempus and pronouns.

216
00:12:48,767 --> 00:12:51,327
Bob and I move out to Vanlöse.

217
00:12:51,583 --> 00:12:55,935
Our home was on top of the station and we had a rod parquet.

218
00:12:56,447 --> 00:12:58,239
It went up and down the stairs.

219
00:12:58,495 --> 00:12:59,775
Bob wore almost everything.

220
00:13:01,055 --> 00:13:03,615
I can stop there.

221
00:13:03,871 --> 00:13:05,151
It happens as one

222
00:13:05,663 --> 00:13:09,247
Tempus change in the middle of the sentence.
 It should not be possible but

223
00:13:10,015 --> 00:13:10,783
but it works!

224
00:13:10,783 --> 00:13:14,111
Yeah, it's great if it does

225
00:13:14,367 --> 00:13:19,743
But I can say that it is also difficult in Danish.

226
00:13:21,535 --> 00:13:24,351
Another plan I had for the novel was

227
00:13:25,375 --> 00:13:28,959
to write a book that was like a palindrome,

228
00:13:29,727 --> 00:13:33,055
thus as could be read from the front and from behind

229
00:13:33,311 --> 00:13:34,335
And you can't!

230
00:13:34,847 --> 00:13:35,871
Then I thought,

231
00:13:37,407 --> 00:13:38,175
the first ........

232
00:13:38,431 --> 00:13:39,455
Should you be able to read

233
00:13:39,711 --> 00:13:43,807
from the front and when the book ends you should recognize them, they are just back and front

234
00:13:44,575 --> 00:13:47,135
They would correspond to Bob's name.

235
00:13:47,391 --> 00:13:47,903
Bob.

236
00:13:48,671 --> 00:13:52,511
So I thought that in the book's half first part everything should go well,

237
00:13:53,023 --> 00:13:55,071
And in the other half, everything bad.

238
00:13:55,583 --> 00:13:57,119
As a rorschachtest,

239
00:13:57,375 --> 00:13:58,911
As a kind of reflection.

240
00:13:59,679 --> 00:14:00,447
But it did not work.

241
00:14:00,959 --> 00:14:07,848
The only thing that went was the first three words.

242
00:14:08,127 --> 00:14:15,295
To make them succeed in the end, the book must start with "Moving Bob and I"

243
00:14:15,295 --> 00:14:16,831
Is that how it says in Swedish?

244
00:14:17,087 --> 00:14:20,531
"Bob and I move", so it can be read from behind.

245
00:14:20,531 --> 00:14:23,487
It will be the opposite at the end.

246
00:14:23,487 --> 00:14:25,535
But now I have revealed how the book ends

247
00:14:25,791 --> 00:14:28,095
.......

248
00:14:31,423 --> 00:14:32,959
Who is Bob?

249
00:14:33,215 --> 00:14:33,727
Bob!

250
00:14:34,239 --> 00:14:36,543
May I say something about the previous book first,

251
00:14:37,055 --> 00:14:40,127
Something about "they" to explain who Bob is?

252
00:14:41,151 --> 00:14:42,943
Yeah but you can do, just for

253
00:14:43,199 --> 00:14:45,503
It's so or ...

254
00:14:45,759 --> 00:14:51,903
We'll talk a little more about it later but I can

255
00:14:52,159 --> 00:14:54,207
say that these books are interconnected

256
00:14:54,463 --> 00:14:55,743
in some ways.

257
00:14:58,559 --> 00:15:04,703
They do not interfere with an absolutely obvious way but they do.
 You feel it.
 One notices it quite

258
00:15:04,959 --> 00:15:05,983
Clearly when man

259
00:15:06,239 --> 00:15:11,871
Have read both.
 But start by telling us who Bob?

260
00:15:12,127 --> 00:15:15,199
Bob is a young man from the countryside,

261
00:15:15,967 --> 00:15:17,503
raised on a farm,

262
00:15:18,015 --> 00:15:21,343
that moves with its dearest to Copenhagen

263
00:15:22,367 --> 00:15:23,903
Because she should study.

264
00:15:24,415 --> 00:15:25,695
And he should nothing.

265
00:15:27,231 --> 00:15:27,999
That's the novel.

266
00:15:29,134 --> 00:15:34,911
He tries to get his life ... He tries to find out what to do.

267
00:15:36,447 --> 00:15:40,000
Wandering around on the streets of Copenhagen

268
00:15:41,055 --> 00:15:43,103
are friendly,

269
00:15:43,359 --> 00:15:44,639
He looks very good,

270
00:15:45,407 --> 00:15:48,223
It's positive vibes around him,

271
00:15:49,503 --> 00:15:51,551
He is a kind of ladies' friend.

272
00:15:52,575 --> 00:15:55,391
But he is very faithful to his girlfriend,

273
00:15:55,647 --> 00:15:58,207
which gradually takes more and more distance from him.

274
00:16:01,791 --> 00:16:03,583
I think of him like ...

275
00:16:04,607 --> 00:16:07,679
Now I have to say one thing about “they”

276
00:16:07,935 --> 00:16:10,239
In “they” is bob

277
00:16:10,239 --> 00:16:11,775
A kind of good helper.

278
00:16:12,543 --> 00:16:18,687
Do you say so in Swedish?
 The good helper?
 It is a literary concept.

279
00:16:18,943 --> 00:16:22,527
He wants others well.

280
00:16:22,527 --> 00:16:25,981
He is also in "Bob".

281
00:16:25,981 --> 00:16:28,159
He takes it with him from his countryside

282
00:16:28,671 --> 00:16:29,439
To the big city.

283
00:16:30,975 --> 00:16:33,791
He looks at all he meets,

284
00:16:34,303 --> 00:16:36,435
You do not do this in normal cases.

285
00:16:36,607 --> 00:16:38,655
But he comes with the countryside

286
00:16:38,911 --> 00:16:40,703
and he greets the bus driver

287
00:16:41,471 --> 00:16:42,495
He is coming

288
00:16:42,751 --> 00:16:44,799
with a kindness

289
00:16:45,055 --> 00:16:48,360
Which gradually becomes more difficult and harder for him.

290
00:16:48,895 --> 00:16:54,015
He is becoming more and more entangled.

291
00:16:54,271 --> 00:16:58,367
His surrounding existence ends up eventually

292
00:16:58,879 --> 00:17:03,231
Like a snare that is tightened.
 Both as with that

293
00:17:03,743 --> 00:17:08,095
one understands that this relationship is about to go to the forest but also because

294
00:17:08,607 --> 00:17:11,679
all his situation becomes

295
00:17:12,447 --> 00:17:15,775
More and more crowded.

296
00:17:16,031 --> 00:17:17,823
Yes it does.
 He gets depressed after all

297
00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:19,871
Because he doesn't have ...

298
00:17:20,383 --> 00:17:20,895
Yes, because ...?

299
00:17:21,151 --> 00:17:21,663
Why?

300
00:17:22,431 --> 00:17:25,247
Because he longs for something he can't get.

301
00:17:25,503 --> 00:17:28,575
And because maybe he longs for what he comes from

302
00:17:28,831 --> 00:17:31,135
But he can't get what he comes from.

303
00:17:31,647 --> 00:17:37,906
I think many people can recognize that, I do it anyway.

304
00:17:38,184 --> 00:17:42,143
In many of my novels I have used everything I come from,

305
00:17:42,655 --> 00:17:45,471
My own time, my own upbringing in the countryside.

306
00:17:51,359 --> 00:17:53,663
Not really so much to move

307
00:17:54,431 --> 00:17:56,479
from an environment to

308
00:17:56,735 --> 00:17:57,503
another.

309
00:17:58,015 --> 00:17:59,295
More that

310
00:18:00,063 --> 00:18:02,623
move from one environment to another

311
00:18:02,879 --> 00:18:05,439
Without feeling failing, failing

312
00:18:05,695 --> 00:18:07,231
What you come from.

313
00:18:09,023 --> 00:18:11,327
It really is about "Bob".

314
00:18:14,655 --> 00:18:19,007
Then you could also ask, who is Bob's girlfriend?

315
00:18:21,055 --> 00:18:23,103
It is very much her book.

316
00:18:23,359 --> 00:18:24,127
Yes.

317
00:18:24,383 --> 00:18:27,711
And "they" is the book that came before "Bob" and

318
00:18:28,479 --> 00:18:29,247
where

319
00:18:29,503 --> 00:18:31,551
Is it about one

320
00:18:32,575 --> 00:18:33,087
Young

321
00:18:33,343 --> 00:18:35,135
Woman and her mother.

322
00:18:35,391 --> 00:18:36,927
The mother is dying

323
00:18:37,183 --> 00:18:37,695
and

324
00:18:40,511 --> 00:18:42,303
They both know ...

325
00:18:42,559 --> 00:18:45,631
At first, the daughter does not know, the mother says nothing, but

326
00:18:45,887 --> 00:18:48,959
Gradually she understands that too.

327
00:18:49,471 --> 00:18:49,983
But

328
00:18:50,495 --> 00:18:51,775
somehow so ...

329
00:18:53,055 --> 00:18:58,687
their lives as well as continues ... somehow ...

330
00:19:00,223 --> 00:19:04,831
Despite the knowledge of all this, they just keep living.

331
00:19:05,087 --> 00:19:06,623
After a while you understand

332
00:19:06,879 --> 00:19:08,927
to

333
00:19:09,951 --> 00:19:13,535
The woman with whom Bob lives together is

334
00:19:14,047 --> 00:19:15,839
the main character in “those”

335
00:19:16,607 --> 00:19:21,983
I was very touched by "they" because, as I told you before, that I

336
00:19:22,239 --> 00:19:23,263
was very reminded

337
00:19:23,775 --> 00:19:27,615
My own last time with my mom when she was sick.
 I think there are many like ...

338
00:19:28,127 --> 00:19:30,943
you said there are many who have

339
00:19:31,199 --> 00:19:35,039
related just to this and heard of this

340
00:19:35,807 --> 00:19:36,575
to you.

341
00:19:39,135 --> 00:19:40,159
This that man

342
00:19:40,927 --> 00:19:41,439
can

343
00:19:41,695 --> 00:19:45,279
Although something so terribly is happening, one can anyway,

344
00:19:46,047 --> 00:19:48,607
So there is still a weekday that is constantly going on.

345
00:19:50,655 --> 00:19:52,447
Because

346
00:19:52,703 --> 00:19:55,007
It can be so hard, and I think it is,

347
00:19:55,263 --> 00:19:57,311
For the daughter and mother here,

348
00:19:57,823 --> 00:19:58,335
in other words

349
00:19:59,103 --> 00:20:00,895
It is not necessarily

350
00:20:01,407 --> 00:20:03,711
better to talk about the great

351
00:20:03,967 --> 00:20:04,735
The emotions.

352
00:20:04,991 --> 00:20:07,039
So if you wish to come ...

353
00:20:07,807 --> 00:20:09,087
They do this in a way

354
00:20:09,087 --> 00:20:12,560
But not much.

355
00:20:12,927 --> 00:20:15,743
I think it's too

356
00:20:15,999 --> 00:20:16,767
her

357
00:20:17,023 --> 00:20:18,815
Mom's way

358
00:20:19,583 --> 00:20:20,863
to make it easier

359
00:20:21,119 --> 00:20:22,399
for her daughter.

360
00:20:23,167 --> 00:20:23,679
To not

361
00:20:23,935 --> 00:20:27,007
Tell her about all the pain.

362
00:20:27,263 --> 00:20:30,000
She wants to make her daughter smile.

363
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:34,961
So they smile a lot, they don't cry, they smile.

364
00:20:35,199 --> 00:20:39,295
It makes everything easier and everything more difficult, too,

365
00:20:40,319 --> 00:20:41,855
In a way, also for the daughter.

366
00:20:42,623 --> 00:20:46,719
So often when readers come to me

367
00:20:46,975 --> 00:20:48,511
and said they recognize the book

368
00:20:48,767 --> 00:20:50,815
So it is very often that,

369
00:20:51,071 --> 00:20:52,095
it is about.

370
00:20:52,095 --> 00:20:59,695
If you feel that you should lose someone, you can feel a great closeness by talking about ...

371
00:21:00,287 --> 00:21:01,823
There was someone who told me,

372
00:21:02,591 --> 00:21:04,533
When my brother would die

373
00:21:04,895 --> 00:21:06,943
was the only thing we talked about

374
00:21:08,991 --> 00:21:11,807
Where did Mom bought her bread,

375
00:21:13,087 --> 00:21:18,617
Which tree stood at our house?

376
00:21:19,232 --> 00:21:22,813
The things that tied the two brothers together.

377
00:21:23,072 --> 00:21:23,840
And no one else.

378
00:21:25,092 --> 00:21:29,472
Because that story Vilgot loses when the mother disappears

379
00:21:29,472 --> 00:21:31,264
It sounds like nothing

380
00:21:31,776 --> 00:21:33,824
But that's how my books are

381
00:21:34,592 --> 00:21:37,664
that you talk about a tree instead of talking about death

382
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:41,248
For both have a relationship with the tree

383
00:21:41,504 --> 00:21:44,832
and there is a dear in that relationship

384
00:21:44,832 --> 00:21:46,880
that makes it easier to talk

385
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:48,880
about everything else.

386
00:21:49,952 --> 00:21:53,024
This mother is a very memorable figure.
 You have said

387
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:56,096
somewhere that you have based her a lot on

388
00:21:56,608 --> 00:21:59,936
your own mom and that your mom has been a very big

389
00:22:00,192 --> 00:22:03,008
Source of inspiration for you at all.

390
00:22:03,264 --> 00:22:07,104
But I didn't lose my mom when I was 16 like

391
00:22:07,616 --> 00:22:08,640
The girl here.

392
00:22:10,944 --> 00:22:12,480
I was 49

393
00:22:12,992 --> 00:22:14,528
So it's something completely different

394
00:22:14,784 --> 00:22:20,160
And I didn't know if I could allow myself to write a novel about a young girl who

395
00:22:20,416 --> 00:22:22,976
Mister his mother when I didn't experience it myself.

396
00:22:23,744 --> 00:22:24,512
But

397
00:22:25,024 --> 00:22:27,584
It felt like losing one's mother

398
00:22:28,096 --> 00:22:29,632
can make everyone feel like

399
00:22:29,888 --> 00:22:30,912
16 years

400
00:22:31,424 --> 00:22:32,960
No matter how old you are.

401
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:35,779
So it went.

402
00:22:35,779 --> 00:22:38,184
And that is right that my mother has often been

403
00:22:38,848 --> 00:22:41,920
a source of inspiration for me, in my books

404
00:22:44,736 --> 00:22:54,001
Should I say anything about it?
 I grew up in a small community, my mother was single as in "those", with my sister

405
00:22:54,205 --> 00:22:58,048
My mother sold perfume on Rödby/Puttgarden ferry.

406
00:22:58,560 --> 00:23:00,608
I worked with her.

407
00:23:01,376 --> 00:23:02,656
As in the novel "Rödby/Puttgarden"

408
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:09,824
She had no real education.

409
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:13,152
My father was car mechanic

410
00:23:13,408 --> 00:23:15,712
And my mother sold perfume, and they were divorced.

411
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:22,624
But there was a great interest in language and literature.

412
00:23:22,624 --> 00:23:23,648
We read.

413
00:23:25,952 --> 00:23:30,560
I have often thought that I am writing a kind of defense

414
00:23:32,352 --> 00:23:39,057
For people that you do not imagine may be interested in literature and language.
 But of course you can.

415
00:23:39,264 --> 00:23:43,360
It is one side and the other side is that my mother was incredibly funny.

416
00:23:43,872 --> 00:23:45,664
And above all self -irrelevant

417
00:23:46,176 --> 00:23:49,325
And in front she had a bright mind.

418
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:51,552
And in front of full of joy

419
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:54,112
Even when something was really difficult.

420
00:23:54,624 --> 00:23:56,672
I have often quoted her

421
00:23:57,184 --> 00:23:57,952
In my books.

422
00:23:58,464 --> 00:24:00,000
It was a great joy for her

423
00:24:00,256 --> 00:24:02,304
when she was quoted.

424
00:24:02,560 --> 00:24:07,168
Once it was a quote included in a review.

425
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:09,472
It was so amazing for her to

426
00:24:09,984 --> 00:24:13,568
she walked around all of her village

427
00:24:13,568 --> 00:24:18,444
And be proud of it.

428
00:24:18,444 --> 00:24:18,944
Yes,

429
00:24:20,224 --> 00:24:26,543
Maybe as a kind of painful ease, I think.

430
00:24:28,416 --> 00:24:32,512
It is very nice to read a mother and daughter relationship that is

431
00:24:33,280 --> 00:24:36,608
Very loving.

432
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:41,216
For whatever it is, there are often the bad parenting relationships

433
00:24:41,472 --> 00:24:45,056
as described in fiction.

434
00:24:46,592 --> 00:24:48,384
I have tried that but I can't.

435
00:24:49,408 --> 00:24:50,944
I can't rewrite

436
00:24:52,992 --> 00:24:54,272
People who are

437
00:24:55,296 --> 00:24:56,320
evil or ...

438
00:24:59,136 --> 00:25:00,416
It becomes one -dimensional for me.

439
00:25:01,184 --> 00:25:06,048
It's like the books grow if they are full of friendly people.

440
00:25:06,048 --> 00:25:08,352
This actually comes more pain ...

441
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:11,168
I can not...

442
00:25:11,680 --> 00:25:14,496
There are, of course, bipers who are unsympathetic,

443
00:25:15,264 --> 00:25:16,288
But not many.

444
00:25:16,800 --> 00:25:22,944
No its true.
 It's not very bad vibes in my books.

445
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:26,272
That's my driving force.

446
00:25:26,528 --> 00:25:31,904
You are looking for what makes one write, which gives the right energy.

447
00:25:32,672 --> 00:25:35,488
It is one of the things that gives me energy.

448
00:25:37,280 --> 00:25:40,096
I experience it now because I write on a new novel,

449
00:25:40,352 --> 00:25:41,120
to

450
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:44,325
each time

451
00:25:44,494 --> 00:25:46,496
I try to create one

452
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:49,312
A little unfriendly

453
00:25:49,568 --> 00:25:50,848
But then I get to write about

454
00:25:52,896 --> 00:25:53,920
Because it will be wrong.

455
00:25:56,480 --> 00:25:59,808
Maybe because I work with a form of recognition,

456
00:26:01,088 --> 00:26:05,184
Maybe because no one wants to see himself as unsympathetic.

457
00:26:07,232 --> 00:26:13,376
What made you want to pull the Bob story out of this one?

458
00:26:13,632 --> 00:26:19,768
What was pocketing?
 Why did you want to tell him about him?

459
00:26:20,032 --> 00:26:21,312
How did the continuation come to?

460
00:26:21,824 --> 00:26:27,968
It is not a continuation, they can be read very independently.

461
00:26:28,733 --> 00:26:31,664
Yes you could say that.

462
00:26:31,808 --> 00:26:36,160
I got the idea while writing "they".
 When I was done with this one

463
00:26:36,416 --> 00:26:38,720
I thought I was finished as a writer.

464
00:26:39,232 --> 00:26:43,840
Because I wrote a book about everything that all my books are about.

465
00:26:44,096 --> 00:26:44,864
I thought that

466
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:46,400
I will never come anywhere

467
00:26:46,912 --> 00:26:49,984
So it struck me that I could write

468
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:52,032
A kind of continuation.

469
00:26:52,800 --> 00:26:54,848
So something that just goes on.

470
00:26:55,104 --> 00:26:56,384
Then I got started again.

471
00:26:56,896 --> 00:27:02,601
And I wanted to let Bob become the main character

472
00:27:06,368 --> 00:27:07,904
It was that with "the good helper"

473
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:11,232
I wanted to expand his character.

474
00:27:13,280 --> 00:27:15,072
So it happened to

475
00:27:15,072 --> 00:27:17,376
the young daughter from

476
00:27:17,632 --> 00:27:18,144
"The",

477
00:27:18,656 --> 00:27:20,960
After her mother dies,

478
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:23,264
Getting girlfriends

479
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:24,032
Bob

480
00:27:24,288 --> 00:27:26,592
and moves home to his mother and father.

481
00:27:26,848 --> 00:27:28,640
And lives there for three years.

482
00:27:29,920 --> 00:27:32,480
That is also why, in "Bob", in the novel,

483
00:27:32,736 --> 00:27:35,296
It's so hard for her to leave him.

484
00:27:35,808 --> 00:27:37,344
Because his parents

485
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:38,624
is her family.

486
00:27:39,392 --> 00:27:41,696
It felt I was good

487
00:27:41,952 --> 00:27:43,744
to treat too.

488
00:27:44,768 --> 00:27:46,560
Grief to lose both

489
00:27:46,816 --> 00:27:49,632
The family and their hubby.

490
00:27:54,752 --> 00:28:01,800
But you still had a ...

491
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:06,016
you let it still just glimpse in

492
00:28:06,272 --> 00:28:11,648
"Bob" that it is related to this?

493
00:28:11,648 --> 00:28:15,912
It is not an obvious continuation?

494
00:28:16,180 --> 00:28:19,328
No, to me it was so obvious!

495
00:28:19,328 --> 00:28:24,448
But I wanted it to stand on the back of "Bob", a continuation of "They",

496
00:28:24,704 --> 00:28:25,984
But no one saw it.

497
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:29,824
And many read it without recognizing anything.

498
00:28:30,848 --> 00:28:31,872
You can do that.

499
00:28:32,384 --> 00:28:32,896
But

500
00:28:34,432 --> 00:28:38,784
Maybe if there are several books in that series, they will be more closely related.

501
00:28:41,088 --> 00:28:42,368
But it does nothing.

502
00:28:42,624 --> 00:28:46,464
I think you might discourage some readers

503
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:48,256
If you tell the reader that it is a continuation

504
00:28:48,768 --> 00:28:54,144
Then it gets so difficult!
 What to start?
 But here you can also read backwards.

505
00:28:54,656 --> 00:29:00,800
You said that when you had written "they" you felt that you had reached some kind,

506
00:29:01,056 --> 00:29:02,336
If I understood you right,

507
00:29:02,592 --> 00:29:06,176
you had reached some kind of finish because you had

508
00:29:06,432 --> 00:29:08,736
written a book about all that

509
00:29:09,248 --> 00:29:14,624
You always write about.
 Then I wonder,

510
00:29:15,136 --> 00:29:16,672
What is it, in your opinion?

511
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:21,536
You rarely ask that.

512
00:29:23,584 --> 00:29:26,144
I have a weakness

513
00:29:27,936 --> 00:29:28,704
Do you understand that?

514
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:30,752
A weakness

515
00:29:31,008 --> 00:29:31,776
for

516
00:29:32,544 --> 00:29:36,138
teenage years or the young years.

517
00:29:36,384 --> 00:29:37,152
I have had that

518
00:29:37,920 --> 00:29:38,944
A weakness for.

519
00:29:39,712 --> 00:29:40,992
And I still have that.

520
00:29:41,504 --> 00:29:42,016
Because,

521
00:29:43,296 --> 00:29:45,344
maybe because life was so far then,

522
00:29:46,624 --> 00:29:49,184
and because one had not yet ended up in a track,

523
00:29:50,464 --> 00:29:51,744
and to

524
00:29:52,512 --> 00:29:54,560
It was so ...

525
00:29:54,816 --> 00:29:57,267
null

526
00:29:57,632 --> 00:29:59,168
So the kind

527
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:03,264
suddenness, suddenly one was sitting on a train

528
00:30:03,520 --> 00:30:08,862
that drove to Germany and life got a new turn

529
00:30:08,862 --> 00:30:10,862
And suddenly one is 40 and married

530
00:30:10,944 --> 00:30:16,576
with the wrong person.
 Because you went a road.
 That openness

531
00:30:16,832 --> 00:30:17,856
found in the young years,

532
00:30:18,112 --> 00:30:19,648
but also

533
00:30:20,160 --> 00:30:21,184
That

534
00:30:23,232 --> 00:30:26,816
be in a standby mode,

535
00:30:27,072 --> 00:30:28,864
one should lose what you come from,

536
00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:31,731
One should find your own way,

537
00:30:31,936 --> 00:30:33,472
its own form.

538
00:30:33,472 --> 00:30:36,032
And it is also often one

539
00:30:36,032 --> 00:30:42,176
impending break -ups of some kind that is just expected.
 As

540
00:30:42,432 --> 00:30:43,456
the death of the mother or

541
00:30:43,968 --> 00:30:49,856
Bob and his girlfriend's separation.
 You are constantly facing,

542
00:30:50,368 --> 00:30:54,464
there is a break up somewhere there but one is in

543
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:55,488
Some kind

544
00:30:55,744 --> 00:31:00,533
Limbo mode.

545
00:31:00,533 --> 00:31:01,033
Before the breakup.

546
00:31:01,033 --> 00:31:01,562
Yes exactly!

547
00:31:01,562 --> 00:31:02,062
Yes maybe!

548
00:31:02,062 --> 00:31:07,008
Why are you constantly returning to this limb?
 What is it that is so ...?

549
00:31:08,032 --> 00:31:11,616
It is very, very interesting

550
00:31:12,384 --> 00:31:15,947
when people do nothing.

551
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:18,272
When the people are not

552
00:31:18,784 --> 00:31:20,064
moves.

553
00:31:22,368 --> 00:31:23,136
There is

554
00:31:23,392 --> 00:31:24,928
readers, especially in Denmark

555
00:31:25,184 --> 00:31:28,768
who say they get furious at especially my women

556
00:31:29,536 --> 00:31:30,048
because,

557
00:31:30,560 --> 00:31:31,328
also the men,

558
00:31:32,608 --> 00:31:37,216
they want to give them a kick or a scolding and say, get an outbreak, move, make money

559
00:31:37,472 --> 00:31:39,264
do something!

560
00:31:41,824 --> 00:31:44,896
I write best about those who haven't done anything yet.

561
00:31:45,152 --> 00:31:46,432
Thus those who are there

562
00:31:48,224 --> 00:31:49,248
The road should be selected.

563
00:31:49,504 --> 00:31:53,600
Maybe because it holds so much more

564
00:31:53,856 --> 00:31:56,416
than to write about someone who just goes the right path.

565
00:31:57,440 --> 00:32:01,536
The most exciting thing in life is when one

566
00:32:01,792 --> 00:32:02,560
Don't know the road to go.

567
00:32:03,072 --> 00:32:06,400
That is incredibly simple idea that for me

568
00:32:07,424 --> 00:32:08,704
I feel completely lost,

569
00:32:09,472 --> 00:32:13,312
Although I am a successful writer, so ponder

570
00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:16,573
Me on how can I live about my life?

571
00:32:16,896 --> 00:32:19,200
How can I get better

572
00:32:19,712 --> 00:32:20,992
Or go another way?

573
00:32:21,248 --> 00:32:25,088
Not away from the books, but only as a human being?

574
00:32:25,344 --> 00:32:26,112
What do I do?

575
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:30,720
That's also how my characters are.

576
00:32:31,488 --> 00:32:33,536
I also think sometimes

577
00:32:34,048 --> 00:32:36,096
All the wait in my books

578
00:32:36,608 --> 00:32:39,168
reflects my own writing process

579
00:32:39,936 --> 00:32:42,240
Because I have so much wait when I write.

580
00:32:42,752 --> 00:32:43,264
I am waiting...

581
00:32:46,336 --> 00:32:49,152
There are so many distractions

582
00:32:49,408 --> 00:32:52,821
and new ways to go

583
00:32:52,992 --> 00:32:54,016
in the writing process.

584
00:32:54,528 --> 00:32:59,648
It is important not to plan too much

585
00:32:59,904 --> 00:33:02,720
And that directionlessness

586
00:33:03,232 --> 00:33:05,280
Maybe reflect in the books.

587
00:33:06,560 --> 00:33:12,704
We have to talk a little more about these female characters.
 Now Bob is a bit like that

588
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:19,104
Figure too!
 He is actually a man.
 But they are often called for,

589
00:33:19,360 --> 00:33:25,504
I scissors a few words from different reviews.
 They are paralyzed,

590
00:33:25,760 --> 00:33:27,808
evicted, jagged,

591
00:33:28,064 --> 00:33:30,368
apathetic and passive.

592
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:31,392
But

593
00:33:31,648 --> 00:33:34,976
Is they really?

594
00:33:35,232 --> 00:33:36,512
Sometimes I feel that

595
00:33:37,024 --> 00:33:41,376
They get a little unfairly convicted?

596
00:33:41,632 --> 00:33:44,448
Yes, I think it's positively meant

597
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:49,824
but not necessarily correct.

598
00:33:57,248 --> 00:34:02,368
There is something about this as well as the planless location,

599
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:04,160
that is all the time,

600
00:34:05,184 --> 00:34:06,976
that you are constantly returning to.

601
00:34:07,488 --> 00:34:09,024
But it is

602
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:15,424
Something incredibly fun about that too.
 And a great driving force for me, in the novels.

603
00:34:15,424 --> 00:34:16,704
Now it sounds boring and tragic but

604
00:34:16,704 --> 00:34:18,240
I'm actually

605
00:34:18,496 --> 00:34:21,312
Very interested in that it should also be fun,

606
00:34:21,824 --> 00:34:23,616
in an absurdist way.

607
00:34:24,128 --> 00:34:27,968
It is the absurd that interests me.

608
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:32,576
That someone should die but you talk about something else.

609
00:34:33,344 --> 00:34:38,270
Often my characters do not say what they intend to say.

610
00:34:38,720 --> 00:34:40,768
I was thinking of another thing,

611
00:34:42,304 --> 00:34:43,328
In this novel, "they"

612
00:34:43,584 --> 00:34:44,864
I thought

613
00:34:45,120 --> 00:34:48,448
All dialogue should be completely meaningless.

614
00:34:49,472 --> 00:34:51,008
And I have actually succeeded.

615
00:34:51,264 --> 00:34:55,872
But no one realizes it one it makes sense.

616
00:35:00,224 --> 00:35:02,784
It is many times completely pointless

617
00:35:03,296 --> 00:35:03,808
because

618
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:07,904
We know what we are talking about, if we know each other well.

619
00:35:09,952 --> 00:35:12,512
We don't have to bring the whole room

620
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:15,072
Because we are in the same room.

621
00:35:15,584 --> 00:35:17,632
In the book you can say:

622
00:35:18,656 --> 00:35:19,680
Do you want it?

623
00:35:20,192 --> 00:35:20,704
No,

624
00:35:21,216 --> 00:35:22,240
I got it yesterday.

625
00:35:23,008 --> 00:35:25,312
No one understands what they are talking about

626
00:35:25,568 --> 00:35:28,896
But that is because they are in the same place.

627
00:35:29,408 --> 00:35:33,504
What is exciting about writing dialogue is that you can make it so alive

628
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:35,296
to get it to

629
00:35:35,808 --> 00:35:38,624
sound like we talk.

630
00:35:38,624 --> 00:35:41,952
And it really is quite often that it is completely meaningless.

631
00:35:42,976 --> 00:35:46,560
This is the way they communicate.

632
00:35:47,072 --> 00:35:48,608
There is a great benevolence

633
00:35:49,376 --> 00:35:51,168
and an absolute lack of,

634
00:35:52,960 --> 00:35:56,288
on communication indeed, in a way.

635
00:35:56,288 --> 00:36:01,664
Another thing that you are also very, very busy with is details.

636
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:08,064
There is also a kind of meaninglessness there.
 You can stay

637
00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:09,600
you very much at

638
00:36:10,112 --> 00:36:16,256
A broken saucepan handle or a dishcloth hanging in a certain way.

639
00:36:16,512 --> 00:36:17,536
There are a lot of those here

640
00:36:18,304 --> 00:36:21,376
The attributes around as

641
00:36:21,632 --> 00:36:23,424
also very much used to

642
00:36:24,192 --> 00:36:25,216
mediate...

643
00:36:26,752 --> 00:36:27,776
History!

644
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:30,080
Yeah, it is clearly

645
00:36:30,336 --> 00:36:33,664
How busy I am of details.

646
00:36:35,456 --> 00:36:38,546
But I do not perceive it as details.

647
00:36:38,546 --> 00:36:43,968
Many times when I sit in the mornings and will write, I think

648
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:45,931
What is going to happen now?

649
00:36:46,096 --> 00:36:48,256
And the books should contain something.

650
00:36:48,512 --> 00:36:52,608
So it becomes that I write very detailed.

651
00:36:54,144 --> 00:36:55,936
Not because it's meaningless

652
00:36:56,192 --> 00:37:00,324
For the details must have a meaning.

653
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:04,384
It is clearly evident in novels when the details

654
00:37:04,640 --> 00:37:06,944
does not matter.

655
00:37:06,944 --> 00:37:11,296
And they always have that.
 That that dish cloth lies like that

656
00:37:12,064 --> 00:37:14,624
means something.

657
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:16,928
You feel very clearly.

658
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:26,144
It is a kind of motor skills that moves the story forward.
 In a slightly absurd way, I would say.

659
00:37:27,168 --> 00:37:31,264
But imagine how busy you can be of details?

660
00:37:31,520 --> 00:37:32,288
Absolutely!

661
00:37:34,080 --> 00:37:34,592
Yes

662
00:37:34,848 --> 00:37:37,408
They fill up so much

663
00:37:37,408 --> 00:37:38,688
in a pain.

664
00:37:39,456 --> 00:37:39,968
Yes.

665
00:37:41,248 --> 00:37:42,879
And they say a lot

666
00:37:43,296 --> 00:37:44,124
about one yourself

667
00:37:44,320 --> 00:37:45,940
and about the others

668
00:37:46,112 --> 00:37:50,464
and often about how one would like to be in relation to others

669
00:37:50,720 --> 00:37:55,840
And another thing in my novels is that the characters are so busy by

670
00:37:56,608 --> 00:37:59,168
How the other looks at them.

671
00:37:59,168 --> 00:38:00,960
And they see the wrong

672
00:38:01,728 --> 00:38:03,520
When they want to see the real

673
00:38:05,312 --> 00:38:08,384
They have taken on the wrong shoes

674
00:38:08,640 --> 00:38:13,248
others perceive them in the wrong way, there is a great longing for

675
00:38:13,504 --> 00:38:15,552
to be a part of

676
00:38:15,808 --> 00:38:16,320
society,

677
00:38:16,832 --> 00:38:18,624
in an uncomplicated manner,

678
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:21,233
But it is constantly complicated.

679
00:38:22,976 --> 00:38:24,000
Just that, simple!

680
00:38:25,280 --> 00:38:29,120
Seemingly simple but difficult,

681
00:38:29,632 --> 00:38:31,929
which we started with.

682
00:38:35,520 --> 00:38:36,800
Can you sometimes,

683
00:38:37,312 --> 00:38:43,456
your books the very ... you are very formally consistent in

684
00:38:43,712 --> 00:38:45,248
in your story.

685
00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:49,344
If one has followed your authorship for a long time

686
00:38:49,856 --> 00:38:54,720
you notice it.
 Can you sometimes get the desire to break off

687
00:38:55,232 --> 00:39:00,474
Helle Helle-Maner and to do something completely different?

688
00:39:01,120 --> 00:39:01,632
Each time!

689
00:39:02,912 --> 00:39:05,472
Every time I think that now it is something else!

690
00:39:05,728 --> 00:39:09,056
I don't want to write the same way.

691
00:39:10,080 --> 00:39:11,616
It was a Danish

692
00:39:12,128 --> 00:39:14,432
who interviewed me, as you do now,

693
00:39:14,688 --> 00:39:15,456
a woman

694
00:39:15,712 --> 00:39:16,736
Who told me;

695
00:39:16,992 --> 00:39:19,552
You found your style very early,

696
00:39:20,064 --> 00:39:21,088
What are you doing for

697
00:39:21,344 --> 00:39:21,856
to keep it?

698
00:39:22,624 --> 00:39:26,464
The answer is that I am struggling to get out of it.

699
00:39:27,744 --> 00:39:31,584
It is not intended that the books should be the same book.

700
00:39:32,096 --> 00:39:33,632
It should be something new every time.

701
00:39:34,144 --> 00:39:36,192
Maybe that's why I would like to

702
00:39:36,448 --> 00:39:38,240
Challenge the form

703
00:39:38,496 --> 00:39:41,312
Because I can't get away from my own voice.

704
00:39:41,568 --> 00:39:42,746
So it may be.

705
00:39:43,267 --> 00:39:48,992
Can you feel the prisoner in your own like ...?

706
00:39:49,248 --> 00:39:55,136
If I understand you right, it's so I remove a scene, because I think

707
00:39:55,392 --> 00:39:56,928
That it likes me too much.

708
00:39:57,952 --> 00:39:59,232
I don't want that again.

709
00:39:59,488 --> 00:40:02,560
In the same way, for example, there are words ...

710
00:40:02,816 --> 00:40:07,680
Each time I finished a novel I spend a lot of time editing,

711
00:40:08,192 --> 00:40:11,008
In fact, that's what takes the longest time.

712
00:40:11,008 --> 00:40:15,637
I always investigate if I have words I used words over and over again.

713
00:40:15,637 --> 00:40:17,637
And so it is always.

714
00:40:18,176 --> 00:40:19,200
So I use

715
00:40:19,712 --> 00:40:21,760
a feature on my computer,

716
00:40:22,528 --> 00:40:24,064
"Search and replace"

717
00:40:25,088 --> 00:40:26,880
But without replacing.

718
00:40:27,392 --> 00:40:29,952
I have a list of 1000 words

719
00:40:30,208 --> 00:40:32,512
As I control how many times I have used.

720
00:40:33,280 --> 00:40:37,611
I think i have only used them once

721
00:40:37,864 --> 00:40:40,210
But then I have used them 20 times!

722
00:40:40,960 --> 00:40:43,264
It can because there is something

723
00:40:43,520 --> 00:40:44,800
That sounds like myself.

724
00:40:45,824 --> 00:40:47,104
For example, a word such as "maneuver",

725
00:40:47,360 --> 00:40:49,920
Is it called maneuver in Swedish?

726
00:40:50,176 --> 00:40:56,320
It depends on whether it is a verb or noun?

727
00:40:57,088 --> 00:41:00,928
I never remember what nouns are?

728
00:41:01,184 --> 00:41:04,768
Excuse!

729
00:41:05,280 --> 00:41:08,352
Yes, it is a noun.

730
00:41:08,864 --> 00:41:12,192
Maybe I'll take a better example?

731
00:41:14,752 --> 00:41:17,824
Yes, but there are some words, it can be a word that actually ...

732
00:41:18,336 --> 00:41:22,432
I discovered when I wrote "Bob"

733
00:41:23,712 --> 00:41:27,877
that I had used the word “half”

734
00:41:28,064 --> 00:41:29,684
Far too many times.

735
00:41:29,856 --> 00:41:30,368
Half,

736
00:41:30,624 --> 00:41:34,208
as in a half apple or half a glass of water.

737
00:41:34,976 --> 00:41:35,488
So

738
00:41:35,744 --> 00:41:37,792
I looked through all

739
00:41:38,048 --> 00:41:40,352
and many were,

740
00:41:40,608 --> 00:41:41,888
At half past one

741
00:41:42,144 --> 00:41:43,424
and at half past five,

742
00:41:43,680 --> 00:41:44,448
And some were

743
00:41:44,704 --> 00:41:48,568
twenty and a half years old, etc,

744
00:41:48,568 --> 00:41:50,592
But other times it had become a mani

745
00:41:52,128 --> 00:41:54,431
For example, I had written that

746
00:41:54,687 --> 00:41:56,223
Bob did something

747
00:41:56,479 --> 00:41:57,503
Half secret!

748
00:41:57,759 --> 00:42:00,063
What is it called in Swedish when something is secret?

749
00:42:00,575 --> 00:42:01,855
Secret!

750
00:42:02,111 --> 00:42:03,391
Half secret!

751
00:42:03,647 --> 00:42:06,207
He did half -secret!
 Then I thought,

752
00:42:06,463 --> 00:42:07,743
How half -secret?

753
00:42:08,511 --> 00:42:14,655
Either it's secret or not!
 So it was a mani for me and I have to remove that.

754
00:42:16,703 --> 00:42:18,495
The kind of attempt to be funny.

755
00:42:20,799 --> 00:42:25,919
But for us who read you there is a ...

756
00:42:26,431 --> 00:42:31,295
It is not possible not to turn off ...

757
00:42:31,807 --> 00:42:35,391
There is such a huge activity, creativity

758
00:42:35,903 --> 00:42:38,719
Just in the way you can

759
00:42:39,231 --> 00:42:45,375
Sneak in a tempus exchange or a pronoun exchange in meaning in a way

760
00:42:45,887 --> 00:42:50,239
that should not be possible to do.
 Yet you do.

761
00:42:50,495 --> 00:42:56,639
It feels like it's a huge, huge activity going on there all the time.

762
00:42:58,175 --> 00:43:03,807
Yes, but it is a form of association.
 You can do everything in a novel.

763
00:43:04,063 --> 00:43:05,855
It has taken me many years to understand.

764
00:43:06,623 --> 00:43:08,671
One can blast scene after scene

765
00:43:09,183 --> 00:43:10,975
And it doesn't have to be difficult.

766
00:43:13,023 --> 00:43:19,167
There is also in your very associative prose, which is quite close to poetry sometimes, you

767
00:43:19,423 --> 00:43:21,853
Have written poetry too, right?

768
00:43:22,099 --> 00:43:22,611
Yes, but very little!

769
00:43:22,751 --> 00:43:26,591
That was before I debuted

770
00:43:26,847 --> 00:43:30,687
I could not control my poet self

771
00:43:31,711 --> 00:43:33,247
I became very sentimental.

772
00:43:34,527 --> 00:43:40,671
I am constantly struggling with, not to cross that limit

773
00:43:41,695 --> 00:43:43,487
I would like to reach almost to that limit

774
00:43:45,279 --> 00:43:49,119
But when did you feel in prose that it had

775
00:43:49,375 --> 00:43:56,307
Found, maybe you still don't feel that you had found your voice?

776
00:43:57,055 --> 00:44:01,500
Here's how I can tell you, this is how I want to tell you!

777
00:44:01,500 --> 00:44:06,880
The latest novels are not minimalist

778
00:44:06,880 --> 00:44:07,731
Because there is

779
00:44:08,007 --> 00:44:08,831
A new kind of ...

780
00:44:09,343 --> 00:44:13,183
There are some shorter episodes that are more poetic

781
00:44:13,439 --> 00:44:16,511
that is highly associative

782
00:44:17,279 --> 00:44:17,791
Yes

783
00:44:18,815 --> 00:44:20,351
And it is so exciting because,

784
00:44:21,119 --> 00:44:21,887
for example

785
00:44:23,167 --> 00:44:25,471
Could it be a section in "Bob"

786
00:44:25,727 --> 00:44:26,751
where I want to ...

787
00:44:27,263 --> 00:44:30,335
It may be so calculating to write novels

788
00:44:30,591 --> 00:44:36,735
That you have to introduce something for the reader to understand that ....

789
00:44:38,527 --> 00:44:42,367
so should I have a sentence that is "it happened in December"

790
00:44:43,135 --> 00:44:47,487
What is it called in Swedish?

791
00:44:47,487 --> 00:44:47,999
It happened in December

792
00:44:47,999 --> 00:44:48,511
But it

793
00:44:48,767 --> 00:44:53,887
What should I place that sentence because the reader understands that it happened in December?

794
00:44:54,143 --> 00:44:56,703
And so I can never find a place to put it in

795
00:44:56,959 --> 00:44:59,519
For all the sentences are interconnected.

796
00:45:00,031 --> 00:45:04,383
It's something I am struggling with and that's the kind of associative

797
00:45:04,639 --> 00:45:05,151
prose

798
00:45:05,407 --> 00:45:08,479
that makes one come from one sentence to another

799
00:45:08,991 --> 00:45:10,271
with a particular logic

800
00:45:10,783 --> 00:45:14,623
Therefore, one cannot distinguish those sentences, such as writing

801
00:45:14,879 --> 00:45:18,975
"It happened in December" between two sentences, because then they break.

802
00:45:19,999 --> 00:45:21,535
In that way

803
00:45:21,791 --> 00:45:27,935
We will soon round our part of the call and let in, if anyone wants to ask any questions to Helle Helle.

804
00:45:29,215 --> 00:45:34,591
I was just going to ask, what are you working on right now and is it something like ...

805
00:45:38,749 --> 00:45:41,759
I can say that because I am in Sweden

806
00:45:42,271 --> 00:45:47,647
Because it's secret but ... can I?

807
00:45:47,647 --> 00:45:51,999
I work with that several people from “those”

808
00:45:52,511 --> 00:45:55,071
gets their own voices

809
00:45:55,703 --> 00:46:03,301
But still it is the same daughter who is the narrator

810
00:46:03,775 --> 00:46:05,823
You're left in this one,

811
00:46:06,335 --> 00:46:07,871
In this group?

812
00:46:08,127 --> 00:46:10,687
I wish an extended “de”

813
00:46:11,199 --> 00:46:14,015
So all the books are a kind of “they”

814
00:46:15,807 --> 00:46:17,343
We look forward to this very much.

815
00:46:17,599 --> 00:46:21,478
Thank you so much Helle Helle for talking to me.

816
00:46:21,478 --> 00:46:22,463
Thanks for getting!

817
00:46:22,975 --> 00:46:26,047
Thanks!
