00:00:02,560 --> 00:00:04,096
Hello and welcome!
 My name is Kent Löfgren.

2
00:00:04,352 --> 00:00:04,864
I'll talk a little about the concept of social class.

3
00:00:06,912 --> 00:00:07,936
Should also weave in a bit about Bourdieu's theories and concepts.

4
00:00:11,520 --> 00:00:13,056
The song starts and talking a little wide

5
00:00:13,568 --> 00:00:16,128
About social contexts and social structures.

6
00:00:17,152 --> 00:00:20,736
Why are they important then yes because most things we do in life

7
00:00:20,992 --> 00:00:21,760
it happens in different

8
00:00:22,016 --> 00:00:25,600
Social contexts so that is why over the years we have social sciences

9
00:00:26,112 --> 00:00:29,440
Researchers have always been fascinated by and research on social contexts and structures.

10
00:00:30,976 --> 00:00:34,048
Some call it social contexts, some call it context ...

11
00:00:35,328 --> 00:00:37,120
Port may be talking about social fields

12
00:00:37,632 --> 00:00:39,168
Talk a little more about it a little later

13
00:00:39,424 --> 00:00:40,448
My point here it's totally

14
00:00:41,216 --> 00:00:42,496
Social structures are important

15
00:00:43,264 --> 00:00:45,056
For all we do happens in a social together

16
00:00:45,568 --> 00:00:49,152
They are social structures can be defined as we celebrate birthday

17
00:00:49,664 --> 00:00:50,176
For us

18
00:00:50,432 --> 00:00:50,944
Or our groups

19
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:53,760
It's about material

20
00:00:54,272 --> 00:00:54,784
But it is also shopping

21
00:00:55,296 --> 00:00:55,808
Symbolic

22
00:00:59,136 --> 00:01:01,440
These social contexts yet or

23
00:01:01,696 --> 00:01:05,792
Social structure of they affect us all our interactions deeds

24
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:08,352
Also how we think and think

25
00:01:08,608 --> 00:01:09,632
Woman different things and

26
00:01:09,888 --> 00:01:11,424
What we focus on our focus toward

27
00:01:12,192 --> 00:01:13,472
These structures

28
00:01:13,728 --> 00:01:15,520
A reasonably stable

29
00:01:16,032 --> 00:01:21,408
Way if anyone would ask me to define social structures, I would say that one thing that characterizes social end

30
00:01:21,664 --> 00:01:22,432
That is that they

31
00:01:22,944 --> 00:01:24,736
Reasonably stable over ten

32
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:30,624
And as I said earlier they may be material or intangible on may be

33
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:32,160
Formalized

34
00:01:32,416 --> 00:01:35,232
Tangible or they may be invisible in format

35
00:01:35,488 --> 00:01:36,256
Traditions and

36
00:01:36,512 --> 00:01:37,024
And values

37
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:39,328
Okay also recruits Mac though

38
00:01:39,584 --> 00:01:40,352
Dominance relationship

39
00:01:41,376 --> 00:01:45,216
You have the social structures then are stable over time

40
00:01:45,472 --> 00:01:46,240
However, they can

41
00:01:46,496 --> 00:01:47,264
Affected and

42
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:48,288
Changed

43
00:01:48,544 --> 00:01:49,568
Mandocello

44
00:01:51,616 --> 00:01:53,920
The French sociologist Pierre Bourdieu

45
00:01:54,176 --> 00:01:55,456
Is an example

46
00:01:55,712 --> 00:01:56,736
On researchers who

47
00:01:56,992 --> 00:01:59,296
Send some closer on social structures

48
00:01:59,552 --> 00:02:01,856
And research this with how people

49
00:02:02,112 --> 00:02:05,184
Perceive the world and how we move in this world

50
00:02:05,696 --> 00:02:06,720
Navigates us

51
00:02:06,976 --> 00:02:07,488
Forward

52
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,072
Statistics Sweden Statistics Sweden

53
00:02:11,328 --> 00:02:12,608
Can you talk a little short about

54
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:14,400
We really can in strange

55
00:02:14,656 --> 00:02:16,704
What do they have to do with social class

56
00:02:17,472 --> 00:02:17,984
Yes

57
00:02:18,496 --> 00:02:22,080
My argument is simply to Statistics Sweden

58
00:02:22,592 --> 00:02:25,920
They remain annually statistics on, among other things, out

59
00:02:26,176 --> 00:02:26,944
Formation and ginkgo

60
00:02:28,224 --> 00:02:31,040
And they have high quality statistics

61
00:02:31,296 --> 00:02:32,832
Through that research area

62
00:02:33,344 --> 00:02:34,880
Touches me and many others within

63
00:02:35,136 --> 00:02:35,648
Social

64
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:36,928
Shame SVT

65
00:02:37,184 --> 00:02:37,696
Taco

66
00:02:37,952 --> 00:02:39,232
Socioeconomically

67
00:02:39,488 --> 00:02:40,256
Index

68
00:02:40,512 --> 00:02:45,632
Or socioeconomic division as it is also called is sometimes a classification that

69
00:02:45,888 --> 00:02:47,168
Central Bureau of Statistics

70
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:48,192
Interest in

71
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:50,496
And this index

72
00:02:51,008 --> 00:02:52,800
Builds up and vocational training

73
00:02:53,568 --> 00:02:54,848
So that if i am one

74
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:56,384
Well educated

75
00:02:56,896 --> 00:02:58,432
Lecturer at a university

76
00:02:58,688 --> 00:03:01,760
Then I consider to belong to a high resource authority

77
00:03:02,016 --> 00:03:02,784
Class

78
00:03:03,296 --> 00:03:03,808
And

79
00:03:04,064 --> 00:03:07,648
The use of resources index is based on the existence

80
00:03:07,904 --> 00:03:08,672
Different layers

81
00:03:08,928 --> 00:03:10,464
People belong to different groups

82
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:11,744
Mountains in society

83
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,048
And Statistics Sweden then not me

84
00:03:14,304 --> 00:03:15,584
Discarded by mapping

85
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:16,608
Conditions and

86
00:03:16,864 --> 00:03:17,376
And habits

87
00:03:17,632 --> 00:03:19,424
Among different groups isa

88
00:03:20,448 --> 00:03:26,080
Of course, this is not a clear or absolutely obvious way to categorize groups

89
00:03:26,336 --> 00:03:31,456
But it is very common not only Sweden but all over the world to index people

90
00:03:31,968 --> 00:03:33,248
From occupation and education

91
00:03:33,504 --> 00:03:35,552
And in our country it is then called

92
00:03:35,808 --> 00:03:36,320
Social

93
00:03:37,088 --> 00:03:38,624
Sharing or SJ

94
00:03:39,648 --> 00:03:40,160
Is usually shortened

95
00:03:41,184 --> 00:03:46,304
I recall that these indexing Anna and categorization, but of course they don't always work

96
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:48,352
On all in all possible same same

97
00:03:48,864 --> 00:03:51,168
We are all the time and groups

98
00:03:52,192 --> 00:03:55,264
Yes the concept of low economic standard

99
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:56,032
Cute

100
00:03:56,288 --> 00:04:00,384
Other perfect example of concepts such as Statistics Sweden

101
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:03,456
Interested for for and collecting data war

102
00:04:03,712 --> 00:04:06,016
And it also has to do with social class that is why

103
00:04:06,272 --> 00:04:08,064
I'll take up your frame for this lecture

104
00:04:08,832 --> 00:04:11,648
Low economic standard is defined in Sweden as

105
00:04:11,904 --> 00:04:15,232
Those who have lower than 60% of the median value

106
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,791
As you earn 60%

107
00:04:18,047 --> 00:04:22,399
Off with you an income message you have low financial default

108
00:04:22,911 --> 00:04:25,727
So for a single person and who has a child so

109
00:04:25,983 --> 00:04:31,615
At the time of recording the autumn here the lecture film, it is about SEK 220000

110
00:04:32,127 --> 00:04:32,639
Storehouse

111
00:04:32,895 --> 00:04:35,711
After tax and cohabiting they are two children for approximately

112
00:04:35,967 --> 00:04:36,479
Tattoo 5

113
00:04:36,991 --> 00:04:39,551
SEK if it is the total disposable income

114
00:04:39,807 --> 00:04:43,135
Heart Then you can say that you have a low economic standard

115
00:04:43,391 --> 00:04:46,207
And again there is nothing I have come up with but it comes directly from

116
00:04:46,463 --> 00:04:47,487
Statistical

117
00:04:47,743 --> 00:04:50,047
Four people can also discuss whether

118
00:04:50,303 --> 00:04:56,447
Upcoming low standard If you have these sums I mean your silent Supe Twitter that I am one I'm not sitting here

119
00:04:56,703 --> 00:05:02,335
Says exactly what is low economic standard and you know that these people some really here Fatty

120
00:05:02,591 --> 00:05:04,895
Delete without my score is just trained

121
00:05:05,151 --> 00:05:06,943
Statical Central Agency has

122
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:08,223
Definitions and

123
00:05:08,479 --> 00:05:10,527
They operationalize low economy

124
00:05:11,039 --> 00:05:12,063
Default in this way

125
00:05:12,575 --> 00:05:13,855
It can change over time

126
00:05:14,111 --> 00:05:16,415
In a few years so maybe they have a different definition

127
00:05:16,671 --> 00:05:17,183
What do I know

128
00:05:17,439 --> 00:05:23,583
Lasting low economic standard is then defined as persons living with

129
00:05:23,839 --> 00:05:25,375
Low economic standard below

130
00:05:25,631 --> 00:05:26,655
Three years

131
00:05:26,911 --> 00:05:27,679
Or longer

132
00:05:29,215 --> 00:05:30,751
Well then wins on

133
00:05:31,007 --> 00:05:37,151
The head is close to social class and I must directly do listen some disappointed that there is none in

134
00:05:37,407 --> 00:05:38,687
Unambiguous definition

135
00:05:38,943 --> 00:05:40,991
Everyone can gather around

136
00:05:41,247 --> 00:05:44,831
However, there are some things that most people agree

137
00:05:45,087 --> 00:05:47,391
As namely that social class i deals with

138
00:05:47,647 --> 00:05:49,183
Our financial factors

139
00:05:49,695 --> 00:05:51,231
But also social background

140
00:05:51,487 --> 00:05:53,279
And this term is then used because it is ending

141
00:05:53,535 --> 00:05:54,559
4 Society

142
00:05:55,071 --> 00:05:56,607
And what the world looks like

143
00:05:56,863 --> 00:05:57,375
Call us

144
00:05:57,631 --> 00:05:59,935
Thick by possibly can do to help different

145
00:06:00,703 --> 00:06:03,263
People or to fully covered just understanding the living

146
00:06:03,519 --> 00:06:04,287
Conditions for words

147
00:06:05,311 --> 00:06:10,175
Another thing that is usually highlighted in these contexts It is then that the concept of social class

148
00:06:10,431 --> 00:06:11,711
It is a relative after all

149
00:06:12,735 --> 00:06:18,879
I wasn't going to talk so much more about social class in some of this particular lecture and point to a number of sources as we have this

150
00:06:19,135 --> 00:06:21,439
Is the interview with Anna I pray for example

151
00:06:21,951 --> 00:06:22,975
Can you take a closer look at

152
00:06:23,231 --> 00:06:25,023
And this thesis of Hassan

153
00:06:25,535 --> 00:06:26,303
It is relatively new

154
00:06:27,327 --> 00:06:28,863
Also includes some discussion

155
00:06:29,375 --> 00:06:29,887
Social class

156
00:06:30,143 --> 00:06:33,215
Then we have the most difficult books around social

157
00:06:33,471 --> 00:06:34,239
Class they

158
00:06:34,495 --> 00:06:36,031
Is actually to recommend she

159
00:06:36,287 --> 00:06:36,799
She is one of them

160
00:06:37,055 --> 00:06:38,079
The few who write about

161
00:06:38,335 --> 00:06:39,103
Social class then

162
00:06:39,359 --> 00:06:40,127
Within my fault

163
00:06:40,383 --> 00:06:40,895
Health pedagogy

164
00:06:41,919 --> 00:06:45,247
Then I remind you as you can at any time browse to statist

165
00:06:45,503 --> 00:06:46,527
German Central Agency's home

166
00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:49,087
And take advantage of all the reports that

167
00:06:49,343 --> 00:06:49,855
Is there

168
00:06:50,111 --> 00:06:52,671
They discuss regularly

169
00:06:52,927 --> 00:06:55,487
The concept of social class and there is some to pick up

170
00:06:57,535 --> 00:06:58,559
Theories concepts within

171
00:06:58,815 --> 00:06:59,839
Sea -host

172
00:07:00,095 --> 00:07:00,863
Social fields

173
00:07:01,119 --> 00:07:01,887
Is perhaps one of his

174
00:07:02,143 --> 00:07:02,911
Most famous

175
00:07:03,167 --> 00:07:08,031
Japanese Anki bye that there are different fields in society of varying kinds

176
00:07:08,799 --> 00:07:10,591
And within these areas then exist

177
00:07:10,847 --> 00:07:12,639
Are there individuals and organizations

178
00:07:12,895 --> 00:07:13,407
There are things

179
00:07:13,663 --> 00:07:16,479
Burns the field and social field

180
00:07:16,735 --> 00:07:22,879
The theoretical tool to try to understand then how these people these groups organizations in

181
00:07:23,135 --> 00:07:24,159
Interacts with each other

182
00:07:24,671 --> 00:07:26,463
And if I understand should be right again

183
00:07:26,719 --> 00:07:29,535
Quite focused on this particular with competition

184
00:07:29,791 --> 00:07:35,167
So he's not only looking at how they cooperate in the field such yes but how they struggle with each other to

185
00:07:35,423 --> 00:07:36,959
Hello advantages and

186
00:07:37,215 --> 00:07:39,263
I might also exert power over each other

187
00:07:39,775 --> 00:07:42,591
I also remind you that there is not a certain one

188
00:07:42,847 --> 00:07:44,639
Roof fields in society

189
00:07:44,895 --> 00:07:50,015
And one cannot say that the boundaries between different fields are clear or concise

190
00:07:50,271 --> 00:07:56,159
Proven not any clear definitions exactly by animals with the fields look like it is simply a theoretical

191
00:07:56,415 --> 00:07:57,951
Tools such as the researchers with

192
00:07:58,207 --> 00:07:59,743
To understand groupings

193
00:07:59,999 --> 00:08:00,511
Efamol

194
00:08:00,767 --> 00:08:04,607
Easy and they cooperate and the competition practiced within the context of those

195
00:08:04,863 --> 00:08:05,375
The field

196
00:08:05,631 --> 00:08:11,775
And the overall purpose is of course to try to understand why people do as they do

197
00:08:12,031 --> 00:08:14,591
To try to understand people's actions

198
00:08:15,359 --> 00:08:16,895
We can take for example an art

199
00:08:17,151 --> 00:08:17,663
When

200
00:08:17,919 --> 00:08:19,711
That person works within the framework

201
00:08:19,967 --> 00:08:20,479
Meat art

202
00:08:20,735 --> 00:08:21,503
no that's wrong

203
00:08:22,271 --> 00:08:22,783
Where there is

204
00:08:23,039 --> 00:08:27,903
Organizations galleries art critics and not least other art

205
00:08:28,671 --> 00:08:30,975
Another example is a student

206
00:08:31,999 --> 00:08:34,559
Reading either a network course or maybe

207
00:08:34,815 --> 00:08:35,839
A course here on campus

208
00:08:36,095 --> 00:08:40,191
That student must adapt to the traditions and norms that exist

209
00:08:40,447 --> 00:08:40,959
Within

210
00:08:41,215 --> 00:08:41,727
Understen's lighthouse

211
00:08:43,007 --> 00:08:49,151
So in summary these field they exist exactly how many they are or where these boundaries go between

212
00:08:49,407 --> 00:08:53,503
The fields it is difficult to say without the ambition is to use the field concept

213
00:08:53,759 --> 00:08:56,319
To better understand the individual and how group

214
00:08:56,575 --> 00:08:59,391
For competing with each other and interacting to reach

215
00:08:59,647 --> 00:09:00,159
Success

216
00:09:00,415 --> 00:09:01,183
Advantages

217
00:09:01,439 --> 00:09:02,463
ETC within the context of

218
00:09:02,719 --> 00:09:03,999
Social structures

219
00:09:04,255 --> 00:09:05,023
What is this context

220
00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:06,047
Called social

221
00:09:06,303 --> 00:09:06,815
Field

222
00:09:07,327 --> 00:09:10,911
Have we slip on and talk a little bit about our light habitus concept

223
00:09:11,167 --> 00:09:12,191
What happens at

224
00:09:12,447 --> 00:09:13,215
Me you

225
00:09:13,471 --> 00:09:13,983
And all the others

226
00:09:14,239 --> 00:09:15,519
Have a life story

227
00:09:15,775 --> 00:09:20,383
It is because we all carry with us past experiences of these within us

228
00:09:20,895 --> 00:09:21,407
Then children's games

229
00:09:21,663 --> 00:09:24,223
These past experiences affect our

230
00:09:24,479 --> 00:09:25,247
Thoughts

231
00:09:25,503 --> 00:09:26,783
Is perception to be

232
00:09:27,039 --> 00:09:29,087
Values but also our actions

233
00:09:29,599 --> 00:09:30,623
All we do is based on

234
00:09:30,879 --> 00:09:31,903
Divi Barbados

235
00:09:32,671 --> 00:09:35,487
These are for the news they take up in

236
00:09:35,743 --> 00:09:36,511
Further in the family

237
00:09:36,767 --> 00:09:37,279
The person

238
00:09:37,535 --> 00:09:38,047
Mio Mega

239
00:09:38,303 --> 00:09:39,327
Relatives friends

240
00:09:39,583 --> 00:09:40,607
Or in organization

241
00:09:41,119 --> 00:09:44,191
And it differs litigant between different groups

242
00:09:44,447 --> 00:09:49,567
And Bo Göran a point here of that individuals with similar backgrounds

243
00:09:50,079 --> 00:09:52,383
They have natural history the sea

244
00:09:53,663 --> 00:09:57,247
They resemble each other regarding perception are interests

245
00:09:57,503 --> 00:09:59,807
Habits that have a common taste

246
00:10:00,063 --> 00:10:01,343
So we have silent concept

247
00:10:01,599 --> 00:10:03,647
It helps us to understand people's

248
00:10:03,903 --> 00:10:05,439
Rings and how they are affected

249
00:10:05,951 --> 00:10:06,463
Previous Funny

250
00:10:07,487 --> 00:10:09,023
The point is that the individual's

251
00:10:09,279 --> 00:10:13,887
Documents are not just by logical and rational decisions

252
00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:15,679
Or not we denz

253
00:10:15,935 --> 00:10:17,471
Rational considerations

254
00:10:17,727 --> 00:10:20,031
Without as much perhaps by individual

255
00:10:20,287 --> 00:10:21,055
Vivel's history

256
00:10:21,311 --> 00:10:22,079
I summarize

257
00:10:22,335 --> 00:10:24,383
Price I start all when lecture

258
00:10:24,639 --> 00:10:25,663
Can you talk about social

259
00:10:26,687 --> 00:10:27,967
And that's probably where we land here

260
00:10:28,223 --> 00:10:33,599
Bourdieu talks in the fact that actions are all performed in a social context

261
00:10:34,111 --> 00:10:35,903
And he then calls these contexts

262
00:10:36,415 --> 00:10:37,439
For social fields

263
00:10:37,951 --> 00:10:39,743
And they are social fields

264
00:10:39,999 --> 00:10:43,583
They are arenas the individuals interact

265
00:10:43,839 --> 00:10:47,935
And competing and they are not void that only exists for themselves

266
00:10:48,447 --> 00:10:48,959
So one can see that

267
00:10:49,215 --> 00:10:49,983
The field

268
00:10:50,239 --> 00:10:51,007
Comes to life

269
00:10:51,263 --> 00:10:53,567
The individuals wander Inger Field

270
00:10:53,823 --> 00:10:54,847
Field

271
00:10:55,359 --> 00:10:56,127
The house's house

272
00:10:56,383 --> 00:10:57,151
Sabarka

273
00:10:57,407 --> 00:10:58,431
The concept of field

274
00:10:58,687 --> 00:10:59,967
What the concept of habitus

275
00:11:00,223 --> 00:11:00,991
Need each other

276
00:11:01,759 --> 00:11:05,599
Now birth is just over but we'll look at the third and last concept

277
00:11:05,855 --> 00:11:06,879
Withdrawal capital

278
00:11:07,391 --> 00:11:09,439
Or more specifically symbolic

279
00:11:09,951 --> 00:11:14,559
And it may well be defined as those that others think are important

280
00:11:14,815 --> 00:11:15,583
Significant

281
00:11:16,351 --> 00:11:20,703
So that which is a symbolic capital in a context it needs of course

282
00:11:21,471 --> 00:11:22,751
Always be something

283
00:11:23,007 --> 00:11:24,031
Think important or

284
00:11:24,287 --> 00:11:24,799
Valuable

285
00:11:25,055 --> 00:11:26,079
It is another context

286
00:11:26,335 --> 00:11:27,871
I saw the group's perceive

287
00:11:28,383 --> 00:11:28,895
Determines what

288
00:11:30,175 --> 00:11:32,991
The social context that determines when something

289
00:11:33,247 --> 00:11:35,039
It is good and sought

290
00:11:35,807 --> 00:11:37,087
I usually take that example

291
00:11:37,343 --> 00:11:37,855
Snowmobile

292
00:11:38,111 --> 00:11:38,879
From blood today

293
00:11:39,135 --> 00:11:40,671
Man is good playing violin

294
00:11:41,183 --> 00:11:46,559
So maybe it is appreciated in some circles but in other social contexts

295
00:11:46,815 --> 00:11:47,583
So you get a little dissected

296
00:11:48,095 --> 00:11:50,399
You may be wondering where the symbolic

297
00:11:50,911 --> 00:11:52,959
Speech can be

298
00:11:53,215 --> 00:11:54,495
They can, in principle, only most

299
00:11:54,751 --> 00:11:55,263
Anything

300
00:11:55,519 --> 00:11:56,543
They can be

301
00:11:56,799 --> 00:11:58,079
A way of speaking

302
00:11:58,335 --> 00:11:59,103
A certain dialect

303
00:11:59,359 --> 00:12:00,895
It may be the way Anna

304
00:12:01,151 --> 00:12:02,431
Moving in the room

305
00:12:02,687 --> 00:12:04,223
It can be the flavor of clothing

306
00:12:04,479 --> 00:12:05,247
Music taste

307
00:12:05,503 --> 00:12:06,527
They can knowledge

308
00:12:07,039 --> 00:12:12,415
About different music styles to sample or as i said earlier it might be the ability to play a special instrument

309
00:12:12,671 --> 00:12:14,463
Or that one is doing some sports

310
00:12:14,719 --> 00:12:15,487
Celebrities

311
00:12:16,767 --> 00:12:17,791
The point is that everything

312
00:12:18,047 --> 00:12:20,095
Not recognized as important

313
00:12:20,351 --> 00:12:22,143
Significant the social context

314
00:12:22,655 --> 00:12:23,167
Tastes

315
00:12:23,423 --> 00:12:23,935
Sigh

316
00:12:24,191 --> 00:12:25,471
Hope you see here how

317
00:12:25,727 --> 00:12:27,007
The social field

318
00:12:27,519 --> 00:12:30,079
Affected by the individuals found inside the field

319
00:12:30,335 --> 00:12:31,871
Every individual who is the girl

320
00:12:32,383 --> 00:12:33,663
Means minicab

321
00:12:34,175 --> 00:12:37,503
And what is highlighted as desirable

322
00:12:37,759 --> 00:12:38,783
Thus what a symbols

323
00:12:39,295 --> 00:12:40,831
Pay in the social field

324
00:12:41,087 --> 00:12:42,623
It varies between different fields

325
00:12:43,135 --> 00:12:43,903
Different contexts

326
00:12:44,671 --> 00:12:50,815
It is usually said that there are different types of capital The cultural capital is, for example, about having good knowledge of

327
00:12:51,071 --> 00:12:52,351
If a particular type of literature

328
00:12:53,119 --> 00:12:55,167
I have read within an area or

329
00:12:55,679 --> 00:12:57,471
That one has good knowledge of a certain time

330
00:12:57,727 --> 00:12:58,239
Type of music

331
00:12:59,007 --> 00:13:01,311
One can also talk about bodily capital

332
00:13:01,567 --> 00:13:03,103
Is about how to look

333
00:13:03,615 --> 00:13:04,639
Swedish appearance

334
00:13:05,151 --> 00:13:08,223
Then you have to have the way you have to go or walk

335
00:13:08,735 --> 00:13:14,879
Boden the cultural capital but also bodily capital can reach in summary in some contexts be a

336
00:13:15,135 --> 00:13:16,159
Access to you

337
00:13:16,671 --> 00:13:18,207
They can give you high status to 5

338
00:13:18,719 --> 00:13:20,255
And in other contexts there are

339
00:13:20,511 --> 00:13:21,279
Totally useless

340
00:13:21,791 --> 00:13:23,839
So the social field that controls

341
00:13:24,095 --> 00:13:24,863
What is rewarded

342
00:13:25,375 --> 00:13:26,143
And what at home

343
00:13:26,655 --> 00:13:31,775
Finally let me say litigran they should so work way that this is then my interpretation

344
00:13:32,031 --> 00:13:35,871
In normal cases, we researchers usually focus on one thing at a time

345
00:13:36,127 --> 00:13:38,687
Either we focus the objective birth

346
00:13:38,943 --> 00:13:40,735
Example material assets

347
00:13:41,247 --> 00:13:42,783
One can talk about a kind of objectivism

348
00:13:43,039 --> 00:13:47,135
Or so we researchers usually look at individual thoughts perception

349
00:13:48,159 --> 00:13:49,951
So then you can say that you have more subjectively

350
00:13:50,463 --> 00:13:50,975
On existence

351
00:13:51,231 --> 00:13:54,303
So what I'm trying to say is that either the researchers usually look

352
00:13:54,559 --> 00:13:56,351
On frames for settlements

353
00:13:56,863 --> 00:14:00,191
Structures or so researchers usually interview people

354
00:14:00,447 --> 00:14:03,519
To find out how these people perceive life value

355
00:14:04,031 --> 00:14:07,615
What characterizes should that he combines objective ice

356
00:14:07,871 --> 00:14:08,383
Also construction

357
00:14:08,895 --> 00:14:10,175
He combines

358
00:14:10,431 --> 00:14:11,199
The study of them

359
00:14:11,711 --> 00:14:12,223
Thought the angels existed

360
00:14:12,735 --> 00:14:13,247
With

361
00:14:13,503 --> 00:14:15,807
Understanding of how individuals think and think

362
00:14:16,319 --> 00:14:20,415
Women of me for their studies so should usually analyze both the objects

363
00:14:20,927 --> 00:14:21,951
And that subject

364
00:14:22,719 --> 00:14:27,839
So it should be Christmas -inspired working methods and in my opinion can be summarized

365
00:14:28,095 --> 00:14:29,119
I have three points

366
00:14:29,631 --> 00:14:32,191
First maps the objective structure

367
00:14:32,959 --> 00:14:39,103
What different positions people and organizations have in these social structures on what resources they have

368
00:14:39,359 --> 00:14:41,151
Not least financial resources

369
00:14:41,407 --> 00:14:46,015
Then in paragraph 2, you try to the researcher interpreted by subjective

370
00:14:46,783 --> 00:14:48,319
One can talk to these people

371
00:14:49,343 --> 00:14:50,111
Cinerama from fl

372
00:14:50,623 --> 00:14:56,767
In step 3, the researcher is thinking about how the individual's choice is affected by the individual's social rear

373
00:14:57,023 --> 00:15:00,351
Background their how the individual's choice is affected by the individual's

374
00:15:00,607 --> 00:15:02,399
Current thoughts and barrels

375
00:15:03,679 --> 00:15:08,543
In my area of research pedagogy, this can then mean that I

376
00:15:08,799 --> 00:15:14,687
Women and men for one study combines a statistical analysis with an interview guide

377
00:15:15,455 --> 00:15:17,759
