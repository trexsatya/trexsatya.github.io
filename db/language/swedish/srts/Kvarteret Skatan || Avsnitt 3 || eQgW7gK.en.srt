1
00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:52.080
Tjena, it's Tord.
 I fax the numbers on Monday.

2
00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:55.200
Then we say so.
 Hello.

3
00:00:56.320 --> 00:01:03.560
Hello, it's Gerhard.
 I fax the numbers on Monday.

4
00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:06.840
It is good.
 Bye!

5
00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:59.880
Well ... there were two ladies out shopping.

6
00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:06.880
They arrived at the vegetable department, where there was a box of cabbage roots.

7
00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:15.040
One woman takes up a cabbage root and says, "It looks like my husband's"

8
00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:23.040
"Well! Is it so big?"
 - "Big? No, but just as dirty."

9
00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:41.800
The farmer and maid would go with the cow to the bull to get her covered.

10
00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:48.080
On the way home, the farmer on the maid looked and said:

11
00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:54.080
"Hörrudu, Anna, can't I do as the bull did?"

12
00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:59.240
Anna started to blush and said:

13
00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:03.240
"Sure you get it, it's your cow."

14
00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:17.320
It's great fun with these burlesque, musty stories.

15
00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:24.440
They are often a little peasant.
 A master of this was my philosophy professor.

16
00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:30.440
It was Christmas time and collection to Save the Children, and he said:

17
00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:36.600
"Then I previously give the money to myself, because I am a solipsist."

18
00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:45.600
According to Solipsism, everything is a product of its own consciousness.

19
00:03:56.480 --> 00:04:04.000
Old cheese and the girl's little tastes good but smells bad!

20
00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:41.320
- These women ... - Yes!
 They make life worth living.

21
00:04:41.480 --> 00:04:44.800
What is a woman really?

22
00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:50.800
My friend, the question is as old as life itself.

23
00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:56.000
- They are enigmatic creatures.
 - How do you catch a woman?

24
00:04:56.160 --> 00:05:02.760
- How do you tie a cloud?
 - How do you hold lunar rays in your hand?

25
00:05:02.920 --> 00:05:08.760
I remember the first time ... I was 14 and she was 27.

26
00:05:08.920 --> 00:05:14.560
We were two lonely ships that met on the ocean expectations.

27
00:05:14.720 --> 00:05:20.440
My hands went on exploration along her hills.

28
00:05:20.600 --> 00:05:26.720
- Then she hit me on the jaw.
 - These meetings!

29
00:05:26.880 --> 00:05:33.120
I remember the first time a woman let me go all the way.
 It was 1999.

30
00:05:33.280 --> 00:05:39.680
We had been together for a long time.
 We had dinner and went to the cinema.

31
00:05:39.840 --> 00:05:46.280
Then we ended up in the same bed and she opened her flower to me.

32
00:05:46.440 --> 00:05:50.120
- You understand what I mean?
 -Yes.

33
00:05:50.280 --> 00:05:53.760
- I mean her sheath.
 -I get it.

34
00:05:53.920 --> 00:05:57.280
I don't eat at home tonight.

35
00:05:57.440 --> 00:06:04.840
The Korean is going tomorrow and we have to sort out everything tonight.

36
00:06:06.480 --> 00:06:10.920
When would I have to meet another?

37
00:06:11.080 --> 00:06:17.000
- Lena, calm down now!
 - Oh, oh, oh!

38
00:06:18.280 --> 00:06:24.880
No, it's the computer!
 There is some screen saver ...

39
00:06:25.040 --> 00:06:28.560
Ah, ah, ah!

40
00:06:30.840 --> 00:06:34.240
I will be as soon as it is clear.

41
00:06:34.400 --> 00:06:38.200
- So, what a small.
 - Lena?
 Lena?

42
00:06:43.680 --> 00:06:47.640
Snap sound is heard

43
00:06:47.800 --> 00:06:54.600
- River, you drugs.
 -Oh sorry!

44
00:07:02.400 --> 00:07:08.440
- Are you still playing ping pong?
 - No, I injured my elbow.

45
00:07:08.600 --> 00:07:15.480
–Ah, damn.
 Did you get operated on?
 - Well.
 Check out here - steal operated.

46
00:07:18.480 --> 00:07:22.360
I can't move my arm longer than here.

47
00:07:32.040 --> 00:07:37.680
- When did you have sex last?
 -Last night.

48
00:07:37.840 --> 00:07:45.120
-How was it?
 - Her eyes were like wells.

49
00:07:45.280 --> 00:07:53.000
The breasts were like swallows and the care was like a marketplace in Cairo.

50
00:07:53.160 --> 00:07:58.880
A myriad of different cultures, and scents from all over the world.

51
00:07:59.040 --> 00:08:02.400
A constant commerce.

52
00:08:03.320 --> 00:08:10.200
She offered me remi, a small autumn leave ... I answered no.

53
00:08:10.360 --> 00:08:14.200
I do not understand?

54
00:08:14.360 --> 00:08:21.880
Neither do I.
 I got lost in the metaphors ... but we cuddled.

55
00:08:39.640 --> 00:08:44.000
-Something else!
 -Ouch!
 How do you think that felt?

56
00:08:44.160 --> 00:08:48.240
Don't you see that I have anxiety?

57
00:08:48.400 --> 00:08:55.440
I am in a sensitive process.
 I sit here and feel -

58
00:08:55.600 --> 00:09:01.480
- And when you interrupt my private sphere, it feels like this ...

59
00:09:01.640 --> 00:09:04.800
Do you write the wine on Thåström?

60
00:09:04.960 --> 00:09:12.840
Hello!
 It is fun that so many people are interested in flower binding.

61
00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:20.680
My name is Markus.
 Everyday I work as a librarian.

62
00:09:20.840 --> 00:09:27.680
My interests are theater, film and socializing.
 What can I tell you more?

63
00:09:27.840 --> 00:09:34.760
Well, I suffer from Tourette's syndrome, a kind of verbal ticks.

64
00:09:34.920 --> 00:09:42.080
Sometimes I scream the word "banjo" quite loudly, for no reason.

65
00:09:42.240 --> 00:09:46.760
I wanted to tell you that already.

66
00:09:46.920 --> 00:09:53.040
Okay, flower binding ... What can we say about the ancient art form?

67
00:09:53.200 --> 00:09:56.160
Banjo!

68
00:09:56.320 --> 00:10:03.720
It was not a real attack.
 I just wanted to show how it sounds.

69
00:10:04.880 --> 00:10:08.800
Flower binding ... banjo!

70
00:10:10.800 --> 00:10:16.640
That was a real attack.
 You will probably get used to it soon.

71
00:10:16.800 --> 00:10:22.480
A flower arrangement can look in many ways ... banjo!

72
00:10:22.640 --> 00:10:28.960
Lilies are nice to have as a foundation, as well as Akvileja and ...

73
00:10:32.480 --> 00:10:37.080
False alarm.
 I'm a little nervous today.

74
00:10:37.240 --> 00:10:40.400
Crocus and begonia ... banjo!

75
00:10:42.280 --> 00:10:46.560
You would see me in a bio -salon!

76
00:11:16.480 --> 00:11:19.760
Carita!

77
00:11:19.920 --> 00:11:23.880
I don't know who I am.
 Who am I?

78
00:11:24.040 --> 00:11:28.880
- But Per - Arne, you are Per - Arne.
 - I'm?

79
00:11:29.040 --> 00:11:35.600
I thought about when we met.
 Then I was one Per -Arne.

80
00:11:35.760 --> 00:11:43.120
- Isn't I another Per -Arne now?
 - No, you are exactly the same as then.

81
00:11:43.280 --> 00:11:51.080
-In some ways.
 - In the center I got to see a jacket.

82
00:11:51.240 --> 00:11:57.960
It was sporty and navy, and so it was impaired.

83
00:11:58.120 --> 00:12:01.960
"My God, what a clip," I thought.

84
00:12:03.120 --> 00:12:11.520
Then I thought, "Such a jacket, does it fit me now?"

85
00:12:11.680 --> 00:12:18.120
"Can I have it now?"
 So I didn't buy it.

86
00:12:18.280 --> 00:12:23.920
- Now when I passed ... - so it was gone!

87
00:12:24.080 --> 00:12:31.280
- How could you know?
 - Now you, my beloved Per -Arne!

88
00:12:31.440 --> 00:12:39.240
You should see what I bought for you.
 Wasn't it this jacket?

89
00:12:42.240 --> 00:12:45.400
No...

90
00:12:47.320 --> 00:12:50.600
...it was not.

91
00:12:51.960 --> 00:12:57.400
If Thåström had been Foreign Minister ...

92
00:12:57.560 --> 00:13:03.280
... so Sweden had been in Copenhagen, or in Amsterdam.

93
00:13:06.520 --> 00:13:13.080
- I am with a mature woman.
 - This is classic!

94
00:13:13.240 --> 00:13:18.080
She knows what she wants, purely sexual.

95
00:13:18.240 --> 00:13:24.600
And everything she experienced!
 Right traffic - the changeover, two world war ...

96
00:13:26.400 --> 00:13:32.640
Then you have to say that she is ripe!
 She knows how she wants it.

97
00:13:32.800 --> 00:13:39.560
Yes.
 She wants it carefully.
 She has just got a new hip joint.

98
00:13:39.720 --> 00:13:42.560
These women!

99
00:14:07.640 --> 00:14:11.720
Ugly are you, but you don't scare me!

100
00:14:25.880 --> 00:14:32.040
-Hello!
 Elsa - Britta, I'm here.
 -Come in!

101
00:14:33.640 --> 00:14:39.480
-Hello!
 - Lord Jesus, who are you?

102
00:14:39.640 --> 00:14:45.760
-My name is Jan.
 I am a substitute.
 - You don't look Swedish.

103
00:14:45.920 --> 00:14:51.040
- Yes, I'm Swedish.
 - Do you own an old man?

104
00:14:51.200 --> 00:14:54.160
I do not know.

105
00:14:54.320 --> 00:14:58.920
Then we will see what to do.

106
00:14:59.080 --> 00:15:05.400
You should start by making a sandwich, and then you do this:

107
00:15:05.560 --> 00:15:13.280
Cut a thin slice of Skogaholms -Limpan and wide thick with Bregott.

108
00:15:13.440 --> 00:15:18.840
Lingon jam, hot milk, ten drops of salmon ...

109
00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:24.040
The stomach has not been doing for a long time.
 Then you divide it into small pieces.

110
00:15:24.200 --> 00:15:29.880
Thick slice, thin slice, film milk, the edges, then you mash it ...

111
00:15:30.040 --> 00:15:35.960
... and put it in a teacup.
 Have you understood?

112
00:15:36.120 --> 00:15:38.960
Yes...

113
00:15:39.120 --> 00:15:45.080
- Why do they send all new ones to me?
 -I do not know.

114
00:15:45.240 --> 00:15:48.400
As stupid as he looks.

115
00:15:51.080 --> 00:15:58.320
In the gender in focus, we will talk about male sexuality.
 What is it?

116
00:15:58.480 --> 00:16:05.000
It used to be ugly to talk about this.
 The man's desire was a bit taboo.

117
00:16:05.160 --> 00:16:11.200
But now it is obvious that guys want as much as girls.

118
00:16:11.360 --> 00:16:17.080
Yes.
 Now it is totally okay for a guy to take the initiative for sex.

119
00:16:17.240 --> 00:16:22.400
We feel more comfortable with our bodies.

120
00:16:22.560 --> 00:16:27.400
A guy can take the initiative for sex without being called loose.

121
00:16:27.560 --> 00:16:30.440
You can try!

122
00:16:30.600 --> 00:16:36.240
But many guys don't get to know their body.
 You feel it feels shameful.

123
00:16:36.400 --> 00:16:43.080
You set up although you do not want to.
 And fake erection, simply.

124
00:16:43.240 --> 00:16:49.240
Many guys don't really know how to relate to their genitals.

125
00:16:49.400 --> 00:16:55.320
One tip for you at home is to explore your genitals.

126
00:16:55.480 --> 00:16:59.680
Feel free to help a mirror.

127
00:16:59.840 --> 00:17:06.640
Then we have the eternal question: what should we call our genitals?

128
00:17:06.800 --> 00:17:10.800
- What should we call it?
 - It's a problem.

129
00:17:10.960 --> 00:17:17.720
We asked that question on our website, and received an email from Jörgen, 28:

130
00:17:17.880 --> 00:17:23.760
"Tjena, I call my genitals 'my little Pippi'."

131
00:17:23.920 --> 00:17:29.480
Here we have one who calls it the "violin".

132
00:17:29.640 --> 00:17:32.720
Bo, 52, calls his "Doris".

133
00:17:32.880 --> 00:17:38.840
There are lots of suggestions.
 Only the imagination sets the limit.

134
00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:46.880
The subject arouses great interest.
 Male sexuality is accepted more and more.

135
00:17:47.040 --> 00:17:51.040
In Denmark there are porn videos too for men.

136
00:17:51.200 --> 00:17:55.160
- We will see more of it!
 -Exciting.

137
00:17:55.320 --> 00:17:59.920
The gender in focus is over for tonight.

138
00:18:02.520 --> 00:18:08.960
- Artist couple, Wenche Myhre ... —So there, Elsa - Britta.

139
00:18:09.880 --> 00:18:16.160
Oh, my God, now all day is ruined!

140
00:18:16.320 --> 00:18:22.920
- You wouldn't mash the sandwich!
 - Yes, you said ...

141
00:18:23.080 --> 00:18:28.080
Look here!
 Have you ever seen a more stylish person?

142
00:18:43.520 --> 00:18:49.480
A Svensson.
 Many Svensson usually ask each other at after parties -

143
00:18:49.640 --> 00:18:56.200
- What would play the lead role if their lives became a movie.

144
00:18:56.360 --> 00:19:02.280
But everyone knows that a Svensson life comes out directly on video.

145
00:19:10.800 --> 00:19:16.720
Here we sit and have a snack.
 It is the heart of the entire business.

146
00:19:16.880 --> 00:19:20.600
-Hello!
 Paul is my name.
 - Lotta.

147
00:19:20.760 --> 00:19:24.560
- You have stood out with Tord all then?
 - Yeah.

148
00:19:24.720 --> 00:19:28.120
Paul you never know where you have.

149
00:19:28.280 --> 00:19:33.480
You can count your fingers when you have shaken hand.

150
00:19:33.640 --> 00:19:40.040
Tord is a fun dot.
 We often laugh at him - behind his back.

151
00:19:40.200 --> 00:19:46.920
- Then you have to be on guard.
 - Yes, Paul is a slippery.

152
00:19:47.080 --> 00:19:50.960
- You start working here?
 - Yes, today.

153
00:19:51.120 --> 00:19:57.640
We need to get talented people who can weigh up for those like Tord.

154
00:19:58.560 --> 00:20:05.520
Don't take Paul seriously!
 Nobody does that.
 He is a bit of a house clown.

155
00:20:05.680 --> 00:20:12.440
- What have you been working on before?
 - With the mentally handicapped.

156
00:20:12.600 --> 00:20:18.960
You will benefit greatly when working with Tord!

157
00:20:21.120 --> 00:20:29.000
He is not mentally handicapped, but he is a little sluggish.

158
00:20:29.160 --> 00:20:36.240
The thing with Paul is that he is stupid in the head.

159
00:20:36.400 --> 00:20:40.320
I'll give you a log - in ...

160
00:20:52.720 --> 00:20:54.400
She bargains

161
00:20:54.560 --> 00:20:57.800
Oh sorry.

162
00:20:59.120 --> 00:21:01.080
She bargains again ...

163
00:21:01.240 --> 00:21:05.720
- Oh, forgive me!
 -No problem.

164
00:21:08.080 --> 00:21:11.400
...AND AGAIN

165
00:21:30.640 --> 00:21:35.920
If you got to choose a characteristic of a guy ...

166
00:21:36.080 --> 00:21:42.760
Humor, honesty or that he is a warm person ...

167
00:21:42.920 --> 00:21:45.760
You can only choose one.

168
00:21:47.960 --> 00:21:54.280
- Nothing is especially important.
 -Why not?
 For example.
 honesty...

169
00:21:54.440 --> 00:22:00.840
I don't know ... and I don't understand that with humor and warmth.

170
00:22:01.000 --> 00:22:04.920
There is a thing that is very important.

171
00:22:05.080 --> 00:22:12.600
- That he is ill -mared is very important.
 -You are right.
 It's crap.

172
00:22:12.760 --> 00:22:17.440
- Are you remembered Peter?
 - Yes, he was very ill.

173
00:22:17.600 --> 00:22:23.960
So fucking ill!
 How the hell could I let him go?

174
00:22:56.480 --> 00:23:03.960
Thank you!
 The next guy is doing this for the first time.

175
00:23:04.120 --> 00:23:09.760
My ladies and gentlemen, a large applause for Torbjörn Sävlund.

176
00:23:12.000 --> 00:23:17.920
Good evening!
 Stand up - comic is warm to my heart.

177
00:23:18.080 --> 00:23:24.880
A musty form of humor, with roots in the Jewish storytelling tradition -

178
00:23:25.040 --> 00:23:31.760
- There is a figure called Badhan, Drev was pushing with the host couple.

179
00:23:31.920 --> 00:23:37.040
An old gold grain from there is as follows:

180
00:23:37.200 --> 00:23:43.280
"The landlord here is so stingy that he just lights the menora to Pesah."

181
00:23:46.960 --> 00:23:51.960
Pesah is, as you know, a Jewish feast.

182
00:23:52.120 --> 00:23:57.880
Another stack within standing up - comic is the dialectal humor.

183
00:23:58.040 --> 00:24:01.880
One of my favorites is Gustaf Fröding.

184
00:24:02.040 --> 00:24:08.520
I think of a piece from his collection of poems "Räggler and Paschaser".

185
00:24:10.200 --> 00:24:14.520
Je Geng Tea Collect Broke on Töre, Tall and Oak

186
00:24:14.680 --> 00:24:19.920

187
00:24:23.960 --> 00:24:27.880
Gustav Fröding ... Thanks for me!

188
00:24:31.400 --> 00:24:37.080
Hello!
 Surely it is good to fuck?

189
00:25:14.400 --> 00:25:21.360
- Carita, we have to talk.
 - There's nothing to talk about.

190
00:25:21.520 --> 00:25:25.880
- Well ... - no.

191
00:25:58.760 --> 00:26:05.720
“Purple Rain” with Prince

192
00:26:59.640 --> 00:27:03.480
Per - Arne, I love you!

193
00:27:14.560 --> 00:27:20.320
- It's exactly what I mean!
 - Frida!

194
00:27:24.000 --> 00:27:27.000
Kristina ...

195
00:27:28.760 --> 00:27:34.280
- Can you mimic a seagull?
 - a seagull?

196
00:27:34.440 --> 00:27:40.240
- Yes, I can.
 - Follow with me for a little while.

197
00:27:57.440 --> 00:28:00.920
I can only pee when I hear the sea.

198
00:28:36.120 --> 00:28:37.920
