1
00:00:02,080 --> 00:00:06,000
You know the feeling when to do a test.

2
00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:13,160
You get the test, watch and you take nothing.
 Absolutely not a word.

3
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:21,480
If you have not plugged, you may blame yourself.

4
00:00:21,640 --> 00:00:27,080
If you have plugged and yet do not take you can test different strategies-

5
00:00:27,240 --> 00:00:31,040
-To get out of that feeling of brain drop.

6
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:39,120
When it feels impossible to focus, you can test a relaxation exercise.

7
00:00:40,120 --> 00:00:45,160
Close.
 Pull up and drop your shoulders.

8
00:00:45,320 --> 00:00:49,520
Place your hand on your stomach and take some deep breaths.

9
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:52,000
Massage your fingers.

10
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:56,760
Stir gently on the head and massage the shoulders.

11
00:00:56,920 --> 00:01:00,720
It makes you relax and reduce the stress.

12
00:01:00,880 --> 00:01:06,920
You get the bloodstream running, oxygenate the brain and get your thoughts.

13
00:01:10,120 --> 00:01:15,600
Now look at the questions again.
 Is it still completely still in the brain?

14
00:01:15,760 --> 00:01:18,800
Okay, then ignore the questions for a while.

15
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:22,880
Write down everything you know about the subject on a scrap paper.

16
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:28,640
You brainstorms then and do not lock the idea of the question but think freely.

17
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:33,960
It is good to draw images to use another part of the brain.

18
00:01:34,120 --> 00:01:38,680
Go back to the scrap paper when the stress has released-

19
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:43,000
-And it is easier to come up with the answers.

20
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:54,760
Do not force words that you do not come up with.
 Write something else for so long.

21
00:01:54,920 --> 00:01:59,840
It may be in response until further notice and you continue with the test.

22
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:05,800
As you read your answers again, the word can suddenly appear in the brain.

23
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:13,600
Keep in mind that you can take help from your teacher.

24
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:17,560
Ask questions.
 Don't just say: "I don't understand."

25
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:20,000
Be more specific.

26
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:24,800
"What does this word mean?"
 "What is in demand?"

27
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:30,440
The teacher may be able to develop the question so that you come up with the answer.

28
00:02:35,640 --> 00:02:41,080
If you get stressed by sound around you try to shut them out.

29
00:02:41,240 --> 00:02:45,040
There may be hearing covers in the classroom.

30
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:48,200
Or bring your own earplugs.

31
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:52,600
Some tips for getting out of the feeling of brain drop:

32
00:02:52,760 --> 00:02:58,200
Do a relaxation exercise to reduce stress and think better.

33
00:02:58,360 --> 00:03:04,280
Write down everything you can think of on a scrap paper instead of getting stuck.

34
00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:07,240
Draw a picture of what is in demand.

35
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:11,680
If you get stuck on one question, write another word for so long.

36
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:16,160
Ask your teacher or ask to have the question read loudly.

37
00:03:16,320 --> 00:03:22,360
Remove sounds that stress you.
 Use hearing aids or earplugs.
