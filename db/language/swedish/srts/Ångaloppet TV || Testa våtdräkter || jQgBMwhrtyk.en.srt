1
00:00:00.820 --> 00:00:04.180
I'll be the last swimming guys, I'll be the last swimming.

2
00:00:14.860 --> 00:00:17.040
I am back on my steel horse.

3
00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:19.900
On the way to Head in Nacka.

4
00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:23.100
There I will meet with Per, and Dennis who works there.

5
00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:26.960
As well as my team when it comes to Swimrun, Lisa.

6
00:00:27.040 --> 00:00:30.460
We drove Ötillö last fall together.

7
00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:34.140
Yes what we are going to do is simply to test some costumes.

8
00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:39.760
Tips for you to buy your first costume, but also check out some news for 2016.

9
00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:45.080
May be good for those who want to supplement or update your equipment.

10
00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:46.780
So, hang on

11
00:00:57.240 --> 00:00:58.800
Hi, fun to see you.

12
00:00:58.920 --> 00:00:59.640
The same.

13
00:00:59.740 --> 00:01:00.240
Hello.

14
00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:01.420
Well all good?

15
00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:02.420
How are you

16
00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:03.060
It is nice.

17
00:01:03.060 --> 00:01:03.780
Nice

18
00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:10.000
My name is Dennis and I work with PR and marketing for CBM products.

19
00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:16.920
And CBM products have Head as a brand in the Nordic countries.

20
00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:21.620
And so, of course, my heart lies in open water swimming and swimrun.

21
00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:27.340
After all, we see a huge potential in an extremely fast growing sport.

22
00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:32.760
Yes, there we have Limited Edition Ångalopp's pants.

23
00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:33.840
Cool.

24
00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:40.740
After all, they are made for a little warmer race like the Ångaloppet.

25
00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:41.320
Yes.

26
00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:45.320
But even considering that swimrun is growing so much in Europe,

27
00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:52.720
And there will be new races in Spain, Italy, Greece, it is one in California, Australia.

28
00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:55.220
Then you do not want to run in a full suit.

29
00:01:55.520 --> 00:02:01.140
So then we have produced this, and it is just like the race costume.
 It is 6 mm floating panel on.

30
00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:07.500
You can combine with a linen, if you would like to.

31
00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:13.060
And not run with bare torso or sports bra, or what you have under.

32
00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:15.600
Well, welcome.

33
00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:16.760
Thanks, Per.

34
00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:17.980
Dennis

35
00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:20.720
Oh, sponsors and stuff.
 Limited Edition as well.

36
00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:25.340
It is an honor to take on them here, I get them here

37
00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:28.340
This is the new one.

38
00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:31.340
After all, it is like a race at the top.

39
00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:32.240
Yes.

40
00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:34.420
But as a rough at the bottom.

41
00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:35.240
Right.

42
00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:39.560
Just to increase flexibility and that it is much easier to run in.

43
00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:41.800
And it has no floating panels

44
00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:45.640
After all, it has been in demand by many a faster costume.

45
00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:50.660
Easier to run in, nothing unnecessary.
 We have no zipper at the back either.

46
00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:51.280
No.

47
00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:53.020
As we had before.
 In order to.

48
00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:56.900
There are many who say, I, among other things, when I drive.
 I never open behind.

49
00:02:57.060 --> 00:02:58.460
I just open up.

50
00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:02.660
So we have shortened the zipper a bit.

51
00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:04.800
So this one will be super fast.

52
00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:08.740
You have run a lot of swimrun, but you are also good in open water.

53
00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:13.640
So it would be a little fun to hear about your Morocco trip, it was a slightly different swim adventure.

54
00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:14.220
Yes.

55
00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:15.620
What did you do there

56
00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:19.440
We swam 25km in four days.

57
00:03:19.820 --> 00:03:25.600
Then there were people from all over the world, and then it really was, all variants of equipment.

58
00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:30.040
Wet suits, hats, some drove without every day.

59
00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:34.680
It was 17 degrees in the water, so I thought it was too cold to swim without

60
00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:37.100
But I was jealous of those who had like this.

61
00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:38.640
Tank Top.

62
00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:43.400
I thought it was too cold to drive completely without a swimsuit.

63
00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:48.480
One day we got away late, African time ...

64
00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:51.760
Then it was tide, and waves.

65
00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:56.480
We chased buoy, the other kite surf.
 What are they doing?

66
00:03:56.700 --> 00:03:58.840
This is much more fun.

67
00:03:58.980 --> 00:04:00.620
Should we try.

68
00:04:00.860 --> 00:04:01.960
We test the new one, it seems cool.

69
00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:02.680
Aero.

70
00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:03.360
Yes

71
00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:05.260
It sits piggy.

72
00:04:05.320 --> 00:04:09.280
Yes, and what I have thought has been difficult.

73
00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:13.860
It is that they should sit well around the trunk.

74
00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:17.820
I've probably never tried anyone sitting so well around the trunk.

75
00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:23.440
There was no problem with it being a zipper.

76
00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:29.820
Would you keep it, or would you cut how does it feel in the knee joint?

77
00:04:30.380 --> 00:04:34.260
Yes, now it does not feel like it is as important to cut it.

78
00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:39.840
I don't think it would be a problem at all to keep it.

79
00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:40.540
No.

80
00:04:41.220 --> 00:04:46.520
It is almost as if you could keep it just so as not to be stiff about the knees.

81
00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:48.020
So when one gets cold

82
00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:51.640
I think, I haven't put it in the wrong direction huh

83
00:04:52.040 --> 00:04:54.320
No, because you have the whistle here.

84
00:04:54.500 --> 00:04:55.300
It's too small

85
00:04:55.300 --> 00:04:55.920
Yes.

86
00:04:57.300 --> 00:05:00.020
You can see that here because it is not possible.

87
00:05:00.280 --> 00:05:02.800
It goes up by itself.

88
00:05:04.380 --> 00:05:06.160
You're too big over the chest.

89
00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:07.440
Jump in the other.

90
00:05:07.560 --> 00:05:08.060
Yes.

91
00:05:08.060 --> 00:05:09.860
It will work.

92
00:05:10.640 --> 00:05:12.520
Then only, you run with the glasses on

93
00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:13.020
Yes.

94
00:05:13.420 --> 00:05:15.640
Yeah, yes but you know we hunt hundreds.

95
00:05:18.640 --> 00:05:19.600
Yes God.

96
00:05:20.240 --> 00:05:23.800
Then I understand why people aim to get in pants and such.

97
00:05:24.100 --> 00:05:26.300
I've never understood it.

98
00:05:26.480 --> 00:05:29.020
It is just to buy a size larger.

99
00:05:31.440 --> 00:05:33.560
So shit, you look like Superman.

100
00:05:33.660 --> 00:05:35.520
Yes, but I'm superman too.

101
00:05:38.120 --> 00:05:39.140
It might work well that one

102
00:05:39.260 --> 00:05:40.960
It may work well.

103
00:05:41.680 --> 00:05:43.660
Now Börje and Ragge get nervous.

104
00:05:43.660 --> 00:05:44.740
I think they get really nervous.

105
00:05:44.920 --> 00:05:49.740
Sitting in Japan and biting your nails.

106
00:05:50.340 --> 00:05:53.000
I have to send a little video greeting to them.

107
00:05:53.300 --> 00:05:56.660
Earn Simon and Ragge, Perra here at Head.

108
00:05:56.820 --> 00:06:01.700
You ski and I charge for the Ångaloppet.
 These are priorities, there are priorities.

109
00:06:03.020 --> 00:06:04.760
Yes, but it sits nicely, how does it feel

110
00:06:04.880 --> 00:06:05.660
It feels good.

111
00:06:05.820 --> 00:06:08.380
Between the branch and shoulders, it is not tight

112
00:06:08.380 --> 00:06:09.240
No.

113
00:06:09.360 --> 00:06:13.040
Because even though it feels claustrophobic now, it should.

114
00:06:13.260 --> 00:06:17.420
It releases, it goes out half a size when you get into water.

115
00:06:17.580 --> 00:06:20.060
And then you open up when you run.

116
00:06:20.060 --> 00:06:21.000
Yes exactly.

117
00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:22.080
Who do you drive with

118
00:06:22.220 --> 00:06:24.660
I drive with Erik Olsson, my old swimmer.

119
00:06:24.660 --> 00:06:25.360
Okay.

120
00:06:27.500 --> 00:06:29.540
He has been a little stronger like that maybe.

121
00:06:29.540 --> 00:06:30.300
Not this year.

122
00:06:30.380 --> 00:06:31.340
No, not this year.

123
00:06:31.460 --> 00:06:34.120
We'll see, I think he's a little nervous now.

124
00:06:34.920 --> 00:06:38.640
I think he is sitting and looking at every episode and just, Satan.

125
00:06:39.200 --> 00:06:41.200
Per looks fast, Per looks fast.

126
00:06:45.280 --> 00:06:46.920
Thanks Dennis, nice.

127
00:06:47.100 --> 00:06:49.680
Thank you Lisa for coming and modeling a bit.

128
00:07:06.840 --> 00:07:07.680
Cool with the logo.

129
00:07:07.760 --> 00:07:08.820
Limited Edition.

130
00:07:08.820 --> 00:07:09.940
Yes, yes, yes ...

131
00:07:10.100 --> 00:07:13.560
I will walk around them here in the office.

132
00:07:14.580 --> 00:07:15.640
Around the clock.

133
00:07:15.640 --> 00:07:16.600
Yes.

134
00:07:16.600 --> 00:07:17.560
Sleeps in them.

135
00:07:17.660 --> 00:07:20.460
Anna just, it smells like skunk.
 You just.

136
00:07:20.880 --> 00:07:22.560
I don't take them off
