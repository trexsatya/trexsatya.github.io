1
00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:07.720
In the season premiere of IFS, the question of all culture in Sweden ...

2
00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:11.720
Syrian on the run from Özz Nûjen: Filip Dikmen!

3
00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:15.000
The pastry Moroccan Guardians: Camilla Hamid!

4
00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:20.440
IFS brother from Jordbro: Big O. Humor philosopher Thanos photographed.

5
00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:24.280
The Swedish's Swedish Arab: Elaf Ali.

6
00:00:24.440 --> 00:00:28.080
The man who gave the Goth a face: Caline!

7
00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:32.040
Comedy Ping Pong between Gbg and London: Evelyn Mok!

8
00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:35.760
The Somali pirate from Götlaborg: Assia Dahir.

9
00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:42.040
Only a puzzle piece is missing: the man, myth - host Ahmed Berhan!

10
00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:46.240
Welcome to the premiere of Season 3 of Ifs!

11
00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:51.120
The only program that makes the whole SVT shake its castle.
 I'm Ahmed Berhan -

12
00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:55.400
- And you look at the quiz about all culture in Sweden.

13
00:00:55.560 --> 00:01:01.360
Our fantastic competitors: closest to me, at Rosa Pult: Inge!

14
00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:04.240
Next to him: Emelie!

15
00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:10.480
Last but not least, from Södertälje but not Syrian - Robin!

16
00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:19.240
Welcome to this fantastic program.
 Inge, choose a panelist.

17
00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:23.880
- Who do you put your cards on?
 - Big O.

18
00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:32.840
Is there any face in Sweden you get happier to see?

19
00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.000
The audience just: "Walla."

20
00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:43.440
Someone who checked too much at Emil in Lönneberga.

21
00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:51.680
No, "boy" is a derogatory word for anyone who has a suedi job-

22
00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:54.400
- Type in stores or in stock.

23
00:01:54.560 --> 00:02:01.040
You should preferably plug or invest in the music or become a broker.

24
00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:03.760
It's true.

25
00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:07.640
A derogatory word for someone with a helf job.

26
00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:09.800
Knever.

27
00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:14.480
You thought that black skulls couldn't know the word "knee".

28
00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:17.720
You think it's true.

29
00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:24.560
Sorry, no point for you.
 You took a chance as a real boy.

30
00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:29.360
Dräng is derogatory, but more for someone who is idiot or useless.

31
00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:35.680
A Polar said: A boy is someone who is a fucking joint picker.

32
00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:41.800
But thank you for starting us.
 - Emelie.
 Who do you choose?

33
00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:44.080
Filip.

34
00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:51.560
Suryoyozone is for Syrians - I'm Syrian ...

35
00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:57.960
It is a social media platform for dating-

36
00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:01.160
- So it's haram, but it's halal.

37
00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:04.160
-Oops.
 - It's dating.

38
00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:07.400
But they share cooking recipes.

39
00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:14.560
So it's Tinder, but also Mom's Facebook.

40
00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:23.040
- Have you been hanging with Syrians something?
 -No...

41
00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:26.240
-What was called ... - it's called Suryoyozone.

42
00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:29.920
--Suryoyo-son ...-She made it Finnish!

43
00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:38.400
- Not "Son", without "Zone"!
 - Zone.

44
00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:42.400
We have it on everything.
 Andersson, Bengtsson ...

45
00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:47.880
Just give her points!

46
00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:53.280
She thought you have a whole platform for a family!

47
00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:58.320
It was very much in one.
 Either you are extremely creative ...

48
00:03:58.480 --> 00:04:04.320
But it felt cake on the cake.
 I think it's false.

49
00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:09.800
You think there are no social media for Syrians solely.

50
00:04:09.960 --> 00:04:12.800
Called Syriansson.
 No.

51
00:04:12.960 --> 00:04:15.400
The whole of Södertälje right now:

52
00:04:16.520 --> 00:04:19.440
Naknemo!

53
00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:23.720
You think it's false.
 Unfortunately - that's true.

54
00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:28.960
Suryoyozone is a platform for Syrians to network -

55
00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:33.960
- Communicating, and as Filip said, try to date, find singles ...

56
00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:37.240
And by singles he means cousins.

57
00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:42.600
Thanks so much Emelie.
 - Robin?

58
00:04:42.760 --> 00:04:46.800
-Thanos.
 -Thanos, time for a video question.

59
00:04:46.920 --> 00:04:51.200
Seni Gidi Findikkiran Yilani Partiginden çikaran

60
00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:56.240
This song from Tarkan was for a while the city's national anthem.

61
00:04:56.400 --> 00:04:59.000
Thanos, what does Tarkan sing about?

62
00:05:00.200 --> 00:05:06.360
He sings about his girlfriend who has been unfaithful to another guy.

63
00:05:06.520 --> 00:05:11.160
And that he should look up the guy and give him a ... /pussy sound /

64
00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:18.280
Robin?
 Do you think Tarkan would floor people?

65
00:05:18.440 --> 00:05:22.000
- I could that ever before ... - Turkish?

66
00:05:22.160 --> 00:05:26.720
No, the song.
 But I don't remember.
 I think that's true.

67
00:05:26.880 --> 00:05:29.480
You choose to believe in Thanos response -

68
00:05:29.640 --> 00:05:33.880
- That Tarkan's song is about lowering the guy who has taken his girl.

69
00:05:34.040 --> 00:05:36.680
/ Piss sound/ no point to you!

70
00:05:39.760 --> 00:05:45.080
This song has nothing to do with force - just a broken heart.

71
00:05:45.240 --> 00:05:50.640
Tarkan is unfortunate in love with a girl who consciously makes him jealous.

72
00:05:50.800 --> 00:05:54.920
As soon as he sees her he wants to kiss her.

73
00:05:55.080 --> 00:05:58.040
Unfortunately, there was no point for anyone.

74
00:05:58.200 --> 00:06:01.520
This season is the extra special -

75
00:06:01.680 --> 00:06:07.040
- For those who win tonight move on to our semi -finals.

76
00:06:11.160 --> 00:06:16.320
Then you go to the final, where you can win the fantastic IFS buck.

77
00:06:22.200 --> 00:06:27.200
–Inge, your turn to choose.
 - Camilla.

78
00:06:27.360 --> 00:06:32.400
Camilla.
 We have the laser cushion, the forest cushion, even
 Zucchiniturken.

79
00:06:32.560 --> 00:06:34.280
Absolutely!

80
00:06:36.160 --> 00:06:41.600
The dog turkey is the laser cure dog, which was sitting in the car in the clip.

81
00:06:41.760 --> 00:06:46.320
Most people only know the laser turf, but he has a dog -

82
00:06:46.480 --> 00:06:49.480
- which has been named "Dog Turken".

83
00:06:49.640 --> 00:06:52.880
- Stacks Inge!
 - You run animal ambulance.

84
00:06:53.040 --> 00:06:58.440
Yes.
 But I didn't have to run any dog turquoise there, not.

85
00:06:58.600 --> 00:07:01.200
There is actually!

86
00:07:03.160 --> 00:07:07.160
–Inge, what do you think?
 - Now it's false.

87
00:07:07.320 --> 00:07:11.400
- What was the laser cushion?
 - He was on and running.

88
00:07:13.120 --> 00:07:16.360
You are right in a way!
 Many Turks lasers.

89
00:07:18.880 --> 00:07:21.680
But you think Camilla is lying -

90
00:07:21.840 --> 00:07:26.760
- And with that I say congratulations to your first point!

91
00:07:29.480 --> 00:07:36.080
The dog Turken was an idea in the 18th century about a human-eating monster.

92
00:07:36.240 --> 00:07:41.600
Even in the 18th century, Swedes called all black shells "Turks".

93
00:07:41.760 --> 00:07:45.960
The dog turkey had dog heads and cooked people.

94
00:07:46.120 --> 00:07:52.720
When I first heard it, I thought of Filip Dikmen with a bad hair day.

95
00:07:56.760 --> 00:08:01.480
Thanks for that, Inge.
 Congratulations on the score!
 - Emelie?

96
00:08:01.640 --> 00:08:04.040
Elaf.

97
00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:13.360
Elaf.
 In the autumn of 2023, the imam aroused from Malmö, Salahuddin Barakat -

98
00:08:13.520 --> 00:08:17.000
- Benefit attention on Facebook.
 What did he write?

99
00:08:17.160 --> 00:08:22.080
That Muslims hate gays.
 It's true!

100
00:08:22.240 --> 00:08:28.680
He wrote type to think that the practice of homosexuality is wrong -

101
00:08:28.840 --> 00:08:33.720
- Or sinful ... so in that case all Muslims are homophobes.

102
00:08:35.120 --> 00:08:38.720
Do you have many imams on your Facebook?

103
00:08:38.880 --> 00:08:42.720
Not many.
 But I want to trust you!

104
00:08:42.880 --> 00:08:47.480
Do you trust me, or do you think Muslims hate gays?

105
00:08:47.640 --> 00:08:50.640
-I trust you.
 - You believe that it is true.

106
00:08:50.800 --> 00:08:53.440
It gives her a point!

107
00:08:56.600 --> 00:08:59.080
It's true!

108
00:08:59.240 --> 00:09:03.480
Imam Salahuddin Barakat wrote that all Muslims are probably homophobes -

109
00:09:03.640 --> 00:09:09.720
-As all Muslims apparently think that LGBTQ documents are a shame.

110
00:09:09.880 --> 00:09:14.160
But this is public service.
 Not all Muslims are homophobes at all.

111
00:09:14.320 --> 00:09:16.840
Only Salahuddin and Elaf.

112
00:09:18.400 --> 00:09:24.760
But you know, I actually checked the Qur'an.
 Or, I googled.

113
00:09:24.920 --> 00:09:30.600
In fact, it is not verbatim that homosexuality is wrong.

114
00:09:30.760 --> 00:09:38.000
But it says that men must not enter a woman's anus.
 So...

115
00:09:38.160 --> 00:09:43.360
-!
 How did we end up there?
 - So anal sex ...

116
00:09:43.520 --> 00:09:46.240
So anal sex is actually prohibited.

117
00:09:46.400 --> 00:09:51.600
Imam should start "Muslims against anal sex", type.

118
00:09:51.760 --> 00:09:56.080
Over to someone who likes anal sex - Robin.

119
00:10:01.240 --> 00:10:05.360
- That's where you cut away.
 -It's done.
 Who do you choose?

120
00:10:05.520 --> 00:10:10.080
–Eh ... Evelyn.
 - It's done, after that comment.

121
00:10:11.840 --> 00:10:16.720
Do I look like those who usually give you massage?

122
00:10:19.160 --> 00:10:22.080
They don't cut it away, Robin!

123
00:10:22.880 --> 00:10:24.760
Evelyn.

124
00:10:28.680 --> 00:10:34.240
There is a tradition in China, Vietnam and Southeast Asia.

125
00:10:34.400 --> 00:10:38.560
Then you have the type of pot when you train your children.

126
00:10:38.720 --> 00:10:45.200
The family gathers when it is time to train and so you have a party.

127
00:10:45.360 --> 00:10:50.520
When the baby walks on the pot, the family stands around and cheers -

128
00:10:50.680 --> 00:10:55.400
–And you give presents.
 Type like a baptism, though for poop.

129
00:10:55.560 --> 00:10:59.920
- Oh, how nice.
 - Supported.
 So that's certainly true.

130
00:11:01.440 --> 00:11:05.880
- But ... - "I have read this on Flashback."

131
00:11:06.040 --> 00:11:09.160
I think that's true.

132
00:11:09.320 --> 00:11:13.080
- That you have a party for pot training.
 - Secure.

133
00:11:13.240 --> 00:11:19.000
Robin, that's not true.
 Unfortunately, there will be no points.

134
00:11:19.160 --> 00:11:25.280
They have a different way of potting, but not through a bridal shower.

135
00:11:25.440 --> 00:11:29.960
Without as soon as the kid should pee or poop they whistle.

136
00:11:30.120 --> 00:11:33.720
- They condition them.
 - As Pavlov's dogs!

137
00:11:33.880 --> 00:11:39.840
- One in the room has read a book once!
 - If I whistle, she shits down.

138
00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:42.080
Stop!

139
00:11:42.240 --> 00:11:46.480
If you treat your children as dogs, do you eat them too?

140
00:11:48.960 --> 00:11:51.880
- Filip!
 - i'm sorry.

141
00:11:52.040 --> 00:11:58.160
Robin, thank you for guessing.
 - Inge.
 You are tagged in choosing -

142
00:11:58.320 --> 00:12:03.960
- But you don't get it, because you have received a letter from Botkyrka.

143
00:12:09.240 --> 00:12:13.200
Yes, here I stand and enjoy a sweet baklava -

144
00:12:13.360 --> 00:12:17.000
- A popular dessert in the Middle East and in the Balkans.

145
00:12:17.160 --> 00:12:23.080
But when the Greeks make Baklava, they use 33 layers of filo dough.

146
00:12:23.240 --> 00:12:28.640
You didn't know that!
 One warehouse for each year in Jesus' life.

147
00:12:31.400 --> 00:12:34.840
Thank you, Dogge Doggelito.

148
00:12:36.600 --> 00:12:41.800
--E,, do you think that's true?
 - It was tricky.

149
00:12:41.960 --> 00:12:45.400
Baklava is just sugar and crap.

150
00:12:45.560 --> 00:12:47.880
-Excuse?!
 - In Agree.

151
00:12:48.040 --> 00:12:50.880
Bla bla.

152
00:12:51.040 --> 00:12:54.280
It's not a mariex.

153
00:12:54.440 --> 00:12:59.880
- Care I know an old crust.
 - Then you can't whistle either.

154
00:13:02.680 --> 00:13:08.560
–What do you think, true or false?
 - Dogge is a filur.

155
00:13:08.720 --> 00:13:11.040
What do you mean?

156
00:13:11.200 --> 00:13:14.840
-What's your name?
 -Thanos.

157
00:13:14.960 --> 00:13:18.120
Come on, Inge!

158
00:13:18.280 --> 00:13:23.800
- I think he is lying.
 - Good that the angle was down.

159
00:13:25.760 --> 00:13:29.600
By then there had been no season 4.

160
00:13:29.760 --> 00:13:34.600
I think 30 layers ... No, it's false.

161
00:13:34.760 --> 00:13:40.320
You don't think the Greeks made 33 layers for 33 years of Jesus' life.

162
00:13:40.480 --> 00:13:44.960
Unfortunately, Jesus is not with you today.
 You don't get any points.

163
00:13:46.320 --> 00:13:50.320
It's true.
 The origin is probably from the Ottoman Empire.

164
00:13:50.480 --> 00:13:55.400
It may have been a Greek protest to do if the dessert-

165
00:13:55.560 --> 00:13:58.720
- With a Christian dispute.
 - Emelie.

166
00:13:58.880 --> 00:14:02.440
- Califf, are you ready for me?
 - Hey, baby.

167
00:14:03.640 --> 00:14:06.680
Hey!

168
00:14:06.840 --> 00:14:08.320
Caline!

169
00:14:08.480 --> 00:14:11.520
- Nino Brown.
 -What is this?

170
00:14:11.680 --> 00:14:14.840
Ahmed before he got a beard.

171
00:14:18.520 --> 00:14:23.600
It is used as a substitute when trying to quit smoking.

172
00:14:23.760 --> 00:14:28.840
Instead of sucking on a cigar, you suck on that twig.

173
00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:31.920
- Is it the one you hold?
 -Yes.

174
00:14:32.080 --> 00:14:36.240
- I look at him deep in the eyes.
 - It is common during fasting.

175
00:14:36.400 --> 00:14:40.440
- For you must not smoke then.
 -It's true.

176
00:14:40.600 --> 00:14:42.560
But...

177
00:14:42.720 --> 00:14:46.840
- No, I think it's false.
 –You think about califf ...

178
00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:52.000
Now you give me that look again.
 I'm getting stressed!

179
00:14:52.160 --> 00:14:56.480
- It's false!
 - You think Kaliffa is lying.

180
00:14:56.640 --> 00:14:58.680
Congratulations!
 One more point.

181
00:15:01.520 --> 00:15:06.200
Twigs from the Salvadora Persica tree are used to clean the teeth.

182
00:15:06.360 --> 00:15:10.840
It is common in the Middle East and Africa and is linked to Islam-

183
00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:16.120
- Then the Prophet used "Miswak" regularly.
 A natural toothbrush.

184
00:15:17.120 --> 00:15:20.800
- Can you show how to do it?
 -Like this.

185
00:15:20.960 --> 00:15:24.720
Emelie wishes she was that stick.

186
00:15:24.880 --> 00:15:28.920
As soon as he did this, her leg ...

187
00:15:29.560 --> 00:15:33.560
I saw when Evelyn stuffed it in the butt before.

188
00:15:39.040 --> 00:15:45.760
Congratulations Emelie.
 One more point.
 - Robin!
 You are from Södertälje.

189
00:15:45.920 --> 00:15:48.520
You can swear in Arabic?

190
00:15:48.680 --> 00:15:51.280
"Nakno emo".

191
00:15:55.680 --> 00:15:59.480
Time out!
 Syrians are not Arabs!

192
00:16:02.560 --> 00:16:07.920
It was Syrian!
 You have taken everything from us.
 Don't take our language too!

193
00:16:15.360 --> 00:16:20.000
Robin learned something new.
 "Are Syrians not Arabs?"

194
00:16:20.160 --> 00:16:24.120
He comes back to Södertälje: "Ey guys, Syrians are Turks."

195
00:16:24.280 --> 00:16:31.240
- They have deceived me the whole upbringing.
 -Cruelly.
 But now you have to take a point.

196
00:16:31.400 --> 00:16:37.160
To get a chance to move on.
 You put your card on Assia.

197
00:16:37.320 --> 00:16:39.840
–Yes.
 Save me.
 --Assia.

198
00:16:47.680 --> 00:16:52.480
This is the first time Filip is told that Somalia has a government.

199
00:16:52.640 --> 00:16:56.720
I thought you were just hanging out on banana fields.

200
00:16:58.360 --> 00:17:02.000
Camilla, directly: "I have sponsors and stuff."

201
00:17:02.160 --> 00:17:07.640
- Should you come "at my peeps"?
 - Get a country.

202
00:17:10.520 --> 00:17:12.880
Yi-ha!

203
00:17:13.520 --> 00:17:15.360
Sorry.
 The question?

204
00:17:15.520 --> 00:17:18.720
What has the Somali government sanctioned in Sweden?

205
00:17:18.880 --> 00:17:21.840
- Consolidation.
 -Oh my God!

206
00:17:22.400 --> 00:17:25.520
Sorry!
 I'll take it back.

207
00:17:25.960 --> 00:17:31.240
No!
 What the Somali government has approved is the first national team ...

208
00:17:31.400 --> 00:17:33.400
... in bandy.

209
00:17:33.560 --> 00:17:36.280
Laugh?
 /LAUGH/

210
00:17:36.440 --> 00:17:43.760
They are based in Borlänge and are the world's first African national team -

211
00:17:43.920 --> 00:17:46.600
- In bandy.

212
00:17:46.760 --> 00:17:53.000
- Are there Somalis in Borlänge?
 - They are in Lithuania.
 They are everywhere!

213
00:17:53.160 --> 00:17:55.880
Except in the labor market.

214
00:17:56.040 --> 00:18:01.200
Boom!
 Oh, shit.
 Just because it came from Elaf ...

215
00:18:02.280 --> 00:18:07.480
Three seasons, sixteen episodes ... - Robin, what do you think?

216
00:18:07.640 --> 00:18:10.680
I think that's true.

217
00:18:10.840 --> 00:18:14.040
Congratulations to your first point!

218
00:18:17.160 --> 00:18:21.880
The first African bandy team was formed in Borlänge -

219
00:18:22.040 --> 00:18:24.680
- and was sanctioned by the Olympic Committee.

220
00:18:24.840 --> 00:18:29.280
- Emelie, you have already moved on.
 -Is it true?!

221
00:18:30.760 --> 00:18:35.400
But we have to decide which of the guys comes along.

222
00:18:35.560 --> 00:18:40.200
Time for a rash question: closest wins.

223
00:18:42.200 --> 00:18:46.200
In the classic song "The Vocal's Favorites" with Labyrinth -

224
00:18:46.360 --> 00:18:49.680
- They show love for suburbs and streets.

225
00:18:49.840 --> 00:18:53.360
How many resorts and streets are mentioned?

226
00:19:00.120 --> 00:19:05.120
Robin turns to someone in the audience: "Brother, I ask you, solve this."

227
00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:08.920
- Have you written down your answer?
 -Yes.

228
00:19:09.080 --> 00:19:12.040
Show them at the same time.
 Three, two, one!

229
00:19:13.160 --> 00:19:15.960
5 and 14. OH!

230
00:19:16.880 --> 00:19:22.400
The question was therefore how many places and streets are mentioned in the song.
 Response:

231
00:19:22.560 --> 00:19:24.840
22!

232
00:19:25.000 --> 00:19:30.840
So congratulations, Inge!
 - Robin, thank you for joining.

233
00:19:31.000 --> 00:19:37.000
Unfortunately, you do not move on but Inge and Emelie run the duel.

234
00:19:42.400 --> 00:19:48.480
It's time for the round we call the duel.
 Freedom of choice is over.

235
00:19:48.640 --> 00:19:53.560
From now on, I choose the panelists to answer.

236
00:19:53.720 --> 00:19:59.360
Two panelists should answer at the same time.
 One tells the truth-

237
00:19:59.520 --> 00:20:03.000
- And the other a lie.

238
00:20:03.160 --> 00:20:08.720
Inge, we start with you.
 Your panelists will be Assia and Caline.

239
00:20:11.280 --> 00:20:15.640
In 2013, Labyrinth got headlines over an event at the Grammis Gala.

240
00:20:16.800 --> 00:20:21.960
They mow, they mow two, they mow three fire!

241
00:20:23.920 --> 00:20:27.440
That's what happened.

242
00:20:27.600 --> 00:20:31.400
I thought it was the Lion King.
 Some Disney song.

243
00:20:31.560 --> 00:20:34.360
/Mimics/

244
00:20:35.800 --> 00:20:38.040
For real...

245
00:20:38.200 --> 00:20:41.640
Labyrinth was a little Kanye West: iga-

246
00:20:41.800 --> 00:20:46.880
- And stormed the stage when Danny Sudoku won.
 Saucedo!

247
00:20:49.080 --> 00:20:52.680
Because he won the best album and not them.

248
00:20:52.840 --> 00:20:57.160
"Yo Danny, I'm a Let You Finish But We had the best album."

249
00:20:57.320 --> 00:20:59.760
"We had a real one asked there."

250
00:20:59.920 --> 00:21:02.440
"They mow one, they mow two!"

251
00:21:05.800 --> 00:21:10.120
The guys were a little stressed, so they smoked a joint -

252
00:21:10.280 --> 00:21:13.560
- At the after party at Café Opera.

253
00:21:13.720 --> 00:21:16.520
I think they smoked, actually.

254
00:21:16.680 --> 00:21:21.440
- What a racist!
 - I believe in Kaliffa.

255
00:21:21.600 --> 00:21:24.080
You choose to believe in Kaliffa.

256
00:21:24.240 --> 00:21:29.560
You do this right in. Congratulations, Inge.

257
00:21:29.720 --> 00:21:34.880
That's right.
 At the after party at Café Opera, they chose to ...

258
00:21:35.920 --> 00:21:39.160
... and not fit it to anyone else.

259
00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:44.680
Emelie, you should talk to Evelyn and Camilla.

260
00:21:48.600 --> 00:21:51.880
The ring in the Muslim story about the ring.

261
00:21:53.520 --> 00:21:59.320
Okay, no.
 The Allah Ring is ... at Muslim funerals-

262
00:21:59.480 --> 00:22:05.280
– Using the nearest family stands in a ring around the coffin -

263
00:22:05.440 --> 00:22:11.160
- And so you pray a prayer for the dead.
 It's called the Allah ring.

264
00:22:11.320 --> 00:22:14.800
Okay, but now the Muslim will speak.

265
00:22:14.960 --> 00:22:20.200
It is a ring from the Viking Age where you engraved the word Allah -

266
00:22:20.360 --> 00:22:25.320
- Written in Arabic.
 The ring has been exhibited at the Historical Museum.

267
00:22:25.480 --> 00:22:30.240
- I am the Muslim!
 I am right.
 –Emelie, what do you say?

268
00:22:30.400 --> 00:22:36.920
I'm afraid I'm losing.
 But ... Evelyn, I think you're right.

269
00:22:37.080 --> 00:22:40.640
- Now Camilla goes home!
 - You believe in Evelyn.

270
00:22:40.800 --> 00:22:45.480
-Yes.
 Camilla sounds so convinced.
 - Because I'm a Muslim!

271
00:22:45.640 --> 00:22:50.160
Evelyn said that the Allah ring is a ceremony at the funerals-

272
00:22:50.320 --> 00:22:57.080
- Where you stand in ring and pray.
 It was wrong.
 The true answer was Camillas.

273
00:22:57.240 --> 00:23:03.560
The Allah ring has been found in a Viking grave.
 It says Allah on it.

274
00:23:03.720 --> 00:23:09.400
!
 Time for your next question.
 It goes to Elaf and Thanos.

275
00:23:16.920 --> 00:23:24.400
By 2022, people from India and Poland were the largest immigrant groups.

276
00:23:24.560 --> 00:23:30.320
You may not think it is Poland and India, because they are not.

277
00:23:30.480 --> 00:23:36.240
It's not that strange - many came from Ukraine and had to stay.

278
00:23:36.400 --> 00:23:39.280
Ukraine, simply.

279
00:23:39.440 --> 00:23:41.960
Mm.
 But that is not true.

280
00:23:43.440 --> 00:23:48.200
You may not think about it, because they are light -haired and blend in.

281
00:23:48.360 --> 00:23:51.040
It may be mostly noticeable on the brothels.

282
00:23:53.080 --> 00:23:55.840
Elaf, you have stepped the fuck up.
 It was rough-

283
00:23:56.000 --> 00:23:59.480
- But you have graduated in Blatt.

284
00:24:04.600 --> 00:24:10.080
Each time someone has a good punchline, Filip will come and high-fuck!

285
00:24:10.240 --> 00:24:13.320
Sit down and shut up.

286
00:24:14.320 --> 00:24:20.320
It is enough.
 You are like bird buzz, you are everywhere!
 Stop it!

287
00:24:20.480 --> 00:24:23.520
-Inge?
 -Poland.
 India.

288
00:24:27.120 --> 00:24:31.080
The question was probably which - not plural.

289
00:24:31.240 --> 00:24:33.520
Oh ...

290
00:24:35.240 --> 00:24:39.040
Pluralis means two.
 More than one.

291
00:24:40.760 --> 00:24:43.680
And the program became SFI!

292
00:24:48.120 --> 00:24:52.080
- Then I believe in Elaf.
 -Ukraine.

293
00:24:52.240 --> 00:24:55.400
- You shouldn't have done that.
 -Yes.

294
00:24:56.440 --> 00:25:00.920
That's not how the program works.
 The true answer was given by Thanos.

295
00:25:04.160 --> 00:25:08.280
The groups that were granted the most residence permits in 2022 were -

296
00:25:08.440 --> 00:25:12.800
- Indies, Poles and after the Germans.
 - Emelie?

297
00:25:12.960 --> 00:25:15.560
–Yes?
 - You have to answer correctly.

298
00:25:15.720 --> 00:25:17.880
Filip and Big O. Please!

299
00:25:26.560 --> 00:25:29.120
–Emelie.
 - Yes, Big O.

300
00:25:29.280 --> 00:25:33.600
- Älvsjö, Klockaretorpet, Smedby ... - I don't know what they are.

301
00:25:33.760 --> 00:25:40.760
Älvsjö was a vulnerable area, but now they are Gitted.
 Do you understand?

302
00:25:40.920 --> 00:25:45.040
Yani, they are not included in the police list of vulnerable areas.

303
00:25:45.200 --> 00:25:49.160
- So they have been removed.
 -Okay.

304
00:25:49.320 --> 00:25:52.880
- Filip?
 - Union what the person in question said.

305
00:25:53.040 --> 00:25:55.760
He has not passed Swedish 2 yet.

306
00:25:55.920 --> 00:26:02.120
These areas competed in a fight in the SM for sandwich cake -

307
00:26:02.280 --> 00:26:08.960
- Where different neighborhoods competed for which cake is the longest and best.

308
00:26:09.120 --> 00:26:13.720
The longest, best and best is also Kaliffa's Tinder cinema.

309
00:26:16.680 --> 00:26:18.880
Seriously!

310
00:26:21.160 --> 00:26:26.640
- Big o, can I trust you?
 - Probably.

311
00:26:35.040 --> 00:26:39.600
-Okay.
 I drive at Big O. - If you are wrong, it's over.

312
00:26:39.760 --> 00:26:41.680
I know!

313
00:26:41.840 --> 00:26:47.320
You believe that these five places have been removed from the list.

314
00:26:47.480 --> 00:26:50.920
Congratulations Älvsjö, Klockartorp, Raneberget -

315
00:26:51.080 --> 00:26:55.080
- Medjebyn and Falkagården.
 They are not left on the list.
 You get points!

316
00:27:01.400 --> 00:27:07.400
Inge and Emelie, you got a point each.
 We can't have two winners.

317
00:27:07.560 --> 00:27:10.640
It will be another issue.

318
00:27:11.440 --> 00:27:14.320
Oh, no!

319
00:27:25.600 --> 00:27:30.080
Oh my God.
 I have no idea.
 This doesn't feel good.

320
00:27:30.240 --> 00:27:32.800
That's the point of this game.

321
00:27:32.960 --> 00:27:36.480
Three, two, one - show your answers.

322
00:27:37.240 --> 00:27:41.600
Zero?
 You don't think any Iranians have been adopted?

323
00:27:41.760 --> 00:27:46.120
You choose zero, you chose 300. The correct answer is ...

324
00:27:46.280 --> 00:27:51.200
582 children were adopted from Iran, which means ...

325
00:27:51.360 --> 00:27:56.600
Emelie, you are our winner!
 Come on here.

326
00:27:57.440 --> 00:28:01.360
Congratulations, Emelie!
 Tonight's winner.

327
00:28:01.520 --> 00:28:05.240
- The single single is your price.
 -Thanks.

328
00:28:05.400 --> 00:28:10.920
A big thank you to our panel, our competitors and our audience.

329
00:28:11.080 --> 00:28:16.400
