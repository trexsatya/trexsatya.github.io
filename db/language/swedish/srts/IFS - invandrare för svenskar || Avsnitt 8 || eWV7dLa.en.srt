00:00:04.840 --> 00:00:09.560
In tonight's section of Ifs, immigrants for Swedes:

2
00:00:09.720 --> 00:00:12.840
Sweden's most fun Chinese: Evelyn Mok.

3
00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.560
The Roman-Jewish horse dealer: Chang Frick.

4
00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:19.560
The world's Swedish Arab: Elaf Ali.

5
00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:22.400
The funny Persen: Behrad Rouzbeh.

6
00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:26.040
Skåne's moral conscience: Petrina Solange.

7
00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:30.200
The infamous Greek from Alby: Thanos Fotas.

8
00:00:30.360 --> 00:00:34.040
The queen of PK elite: Bilan Osman.

9
00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:37.160
My Fakking Brother: Hassan Makaveli.

10
00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:40.720
Sweden's second best celebrity dancer: Filip Dikmen.

11
00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:43.920
And of course: La Camilla Henemark.

12
00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:48.920
So it is our program manager, the incredible Ahmed Berhan!

13
00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:54.480
Welcome to the IFS, the program which has a wider range than the caramel king.

14
00:00:54.640 --> 00:01:01.680
My name is Ahmed Berhan.
 You look at the quiz about all culture in Sweden.

15
00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:10.560
Give a warm applause to our competitors.
 Tonight we have Peter, Lisa and Johan!

16
00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:17.760
The contestant chooses one in the panel that I ask another question.

17
00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:22.720
It is up to it to decide whether the panelist is lying or not.

18
00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:28.440
We have been drawn about who is starting.
 They are a small advantage to start.

19
00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:34.000
The lucky one who won the draw was no less than Johan.

20
00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:42.800
Johan, which of the panelists would you like to start talking to?

21
00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:48.560
- Filip!
 - I choose Petrina.

22
00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:54.240
Najs.

23
00:01:57.760 --> 00:02:04.760
For the bomb belt is not done in XL.
 You have to stay in trim.

24
00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:09.480
Do you know what I love?
 Hassan just: "Did she know?"

25
00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:15.400
It is so.
 It is embarrassing if you are at Kastrup and stand there ...

26
00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:21.880
It's like Advent for Christians, but you count on Muhammad's birth.

27
00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:25.320
As simple as that.

28
00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:30.680
- Yes, what do you say?
 - I don't believe it.
 No.

29
00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:36.200
You don't think Ramadan is the Muslims Christmas calendar?

30
00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:44.640
You do that right in. Congratulations, you've got your first point!

31
00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:51.120
Ramadan is the month when Prophet Muhammad received the Qur'an.

32
00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:56.880
Muslims are fasted to show humility to God.
 Cruelly.
 Congratulations!

33
00:02:57.040 --> 00:03:00.160
Peter, it's your turn to shine.

34
00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:05.640
- Camilla, for AIK?
 Does obviously feel?
 -No.
 But, for the hell ...

35
00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:11.760
Good choice, Peter.

36
00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:22.600
This is very embarrassing.

37
00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:27.480
You've probably heard of it.
 It is not said who it is.

38
00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:33.080
It is actually Pernilla Wahlgren.
 I sat there and everyone looked at me.

39
00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:37.880
- But Pernilla screamed this.
 - Racism is white.

40
00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:43.200
- Peter, what do you say?
 -No.
 I do not think so.

41
00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:49.200
You were too fast, too obvious.
 You just snapped up a name.

42
00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:55.720
- But I was there!
 - I don't know if you speak the truth.

43
00:03:56.880 --> 00:04:01.800
Camilla, typically Sweden to pull down one when you have self -confidence.

44
00:04:01.960 --> 00:04:08.360
You think Camilla is lying?
 You do that right in that.

45
00:04:08.520 --> 00:04:11.240
It was embarrassing.

46
00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:17.400
- Stretch for everyone who screamed.
 - I was, that was me.

47
00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:23.280
I don't know what flew in me, but she mumbled something on American -

48
00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:26.480
- Or some other language that someone said was Scanian.

49
00:04:26.640 --> 00:04:31.160
You are just casually Anna in Jimmie Åkesson's spirit.

50
00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:36.200
I've never been so happy to be dark -skinned.
 Anna is blonde.

51
00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:40.640
- Who did you scream for?
 - Anna Duck.

52
00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:48.800
As soon as you said Anna Anka, I heard someone in the audience: "That's right."

53
00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:53.520
"She's going to speak Swedish."
 Thanks, Camilla.

54
00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:56.840
Peter, congratulations to your first point.

55
00:04:58.880 --> 00:05:01.960
Lisa, who do you choose to talk to?

56
00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:08.840
- I got some Connection with Elaf.
 - I think you are very beautiful.

57
00:05:10.680 --> 00:05:15.080
--Oooh!
 -Elaf, you have to stop fucking.

58
00:05:15.240 --> 00:05:20.600
- I don't.
 - You have to get grades in the program.

59
00:05:20.760 --> 00:05:25.280
- Each program.
 - Tyd, quiet!

60
00:05:33.480 --> 00:05:36.760
It actually means golden snake.

61
00:05:36.920 --> 00:05:40.280
And mothers say it to their sons.

62
00:05:40.440 --> 00:05:46.000
That is why Iranian guys have such good confidence.

63
00:05:46.160 --> 00:05:51.560
They have to go around all their lives and hear that they have a golden penis.

64
00:05:51.720 --> 00:05:54.800
What do you feel, Lisa?
 Does it sound Persian?

65
00:05:54.960 --> 00:05:59.800
- You have a fact here.
 - Do you show, right?

66
00:06:05.680 --> 00:06:12.080
I'll probably buy it.
 I have absolutely no idea.
 It is difficult.

67
00:06:12.240 --> 00:06:16.240
But I trust what we built up.
 That's right.

68
00:06:16.400 --> 00:06:21.720
It's the most Persian I've heard.
 That is absolutely true.

69
00:06:25.520 --> 00:06:29.880
You have combed each point together.
 - Johan, who do you choose?

70
00:06:30.040 --> 00:06:33.280
- Hassan.
 -Brother.

71
00:06:36.240 --> 00:06:38.040
Let's go.

72
00:06:40.240 --> 00:06:43.800
Newborn Kurds.

73
00:06:47.720 --> 00:06:52.720
I will explain.
 I've had to live with it all my life.

74
00:06:52.880 --> 00:06:58.320
You enter puberty too fast as a child and get a beard.

75
00:06:58.480 --> 00:07:03.480
I was a bearded child.
 That's what bearded children stand for.

76
00:07:03.640 --> 00:07:07.160
When I was a bearded child

77
00:07:10.200 --> 00:07:14.320
- Yes, what do you say?
 - I think it's false.

78
00:07:14.480 --> 00:07:17.480
Just right.
 Clearly he lied.

79
00:07:21.480 --> 00:07:26.880
It is a term used derogatory about asylum -seeking guys -

80
00:07:27.040 --> 00:07:29.040
- Which lies about his age.

81
00:07:29.200 --> 00:07:32.000
- Peter?
 - The car.

82
00:07:32.160 --> 00:07:37.240
- I was so shocked.
 - He was ready.

83
00:07:37.400 --> 00:07:43.800
The stereotypical image of a Swedish is light hair, light complexion and blue eyes.

84
00:07:48.520 --> 00:07:51.160
We don't really know that.

85
00:07:51.320 --> 00:07:54.320
But what we know is that it was the same people -

86
00:07:54.480 --> 00:07:59.760
- As the children's friends did not invite dinner.
 So much we know.

87
00:08:03.800 --> 00:08:06.040
I just wanted to tell the truth.

88
00:08:06.200 --> 00:08:10.760
- Tradition is tradition.
 –It goes way back.

89
00:08:10.920 --> 00:08:15.560
Did you want the answer?
 Sorry.
 The answer is ...

90
00:08:15.720 --> 00:08:19.760
They looked much like me, but with blue eyes.

91
00:08:19.920 --> 00:08:23.840
It was black people.
 But they had blue eyes.

92
00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:27.120
-What do you think?
 - No, I say.

93
00:08:27.280 --> 00:08:33.640
It sounded too ... hope it.
 /People are unmatched and laughing/

94
00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:43.200
-Okay.
 The explanation is ... –Wakanda, stand up!

95
00:08:43.360 --> 00:08:46.960
Okay!
 I offer it.

96
00:08:50.240 --> 00:08:54.240
-Okay.
 -It is okay.
 Come come!

97
00:08:59.200 --> 00:09:05.200
It was too widespread.
 It felt like I had it.
 Then when you just ...

98
00:09:05.360 --> 00:09:09.360
I was hoping you gave me a hint that it wasn't so.

99
00:09:09.520 --> 00:09:14.840
- Then my answer.
 - Unfortunately, Peter.
 It's true.

100
00:09:19.840 --> 00:09:22.960
According to Genetics Research at Uppsala University -

101
00:09:23.120 --> 00:09:27.760
–Aded the first people to populate Sweden 11,000 years ago -

102
00:09:27.920 --> 00:09:30.800
- Blue eyes, but dark complexion.

103
00:09:30.960 --> 00:09:35.440
Now, dear viewers, two of our bolts have broken -

104
00:09:35.600 --> 00:09:40.640
- Because the energy in the room is on the fucking top.

105
00:09:44.040 --> 00:09:48.800
You still have the colors that you can see on the scoreboard.
 Let's move on.

106
00:09:48.960 --> 00:09:52.720
Lisa, your turn.
 Who do you choose to chew with?

107
00:09:52.880 --> 00:09:57.040
- I put my fate in Philip's hands.
 -Yes!

108
00:09:57.200 --> 00:10:01.920
In the commute between Stockholm and Södertälje you often hear the word abri.

109
00:10:03.960 --> 00:10:06.720
"The controllers are coming!"

110
00:10:13.280 --> 00:10:17.440
The background to the word, now I look at you Lisa ...

111
00:10:17.600 --> 00:10:22.320
It really means inspector.
 It is used blates in between -

112
00:10:22.480 --> 00:10:26.680
- To warn of the police, security guard or who it is now.

113
00:10:26.840 --> 00:10:29.880
It does not in itself mean that the inspectors will -

114
00:10:30.040 --> 00:10:36.400
- But if you hear "ABRI, ABRI" it is a warning signal for a superior.

115
00:10:36.560 --> 00:10:41.120
I don't have so many reference points on the word ...

116
00:10:41.280 --> 00:10:44.520
You're lying to me.

117
00:10:45.600 --> 00:10:48.520
Abri, you do that right.

118
00:10:53.160 --> 00:10:57.480
Filip lied to you.
 Abri is Syrian for my son.

119
00:10:57.640 --> 00:11:02.240
It can also be insulting if you do not know each other.

120
00:11:02.400 --> 00:11:04.760
Congratulations, Lisa.
 You got one more point.

121
00:11:04.920 --> 00:11:07.280
- We move on to Johan.
 -Thanos.

122
00:11:07.440 --> 00:11:11.040
-Hey man.
 - Hit me!

123
00:11:14.920 --> 00:11:17.640
-Thanos!
 -Comfortable.

124
00:11:17.800 --> 00:11:21.240
Throwback.
 Brand clothing comes and goes.

125
00:11:27.480 --> 00:11:32.320
The bomber jacket had both tough place guys and Swedes.

126
00:11:32.480 --> 00:11:35.640
Adidas pants have all been wearing.

127
00:11:35.800 --> 00:11:42.560
Canada Goose too.
 But the shoes I find it difficult to see them on locality guys.

128
00:11:42.720 --> 00:11:49.000
- So these are those shoes.
 -Okay, the bombs are going away.

129
00:11:49.160 --> 00:11:52.680
- The bomber jacket goes away?
 - You say I ...?

130
00:11:52.840 --> 00:11:58.960
- Do you think that Thanos is lying?
 --What are you saying?

131
00:11:59.120 --> 00:12:05.160
- The shoes are definitely included.
 - It's the tough place guys.

132
00:12:07.280 --> 00:12:10.720
With the fat sole?!

133
00:12:10.880 --> 00:12:15.560
- I just want to ... the fat?
 - Tranos, I have the picture.

134
00:12:15.720 --> 00:12:20.400
- You have the picture?
 - You wore them.

135
00:12:20.560 --> 00:12:25.240
Let them laugh at you, because you got one more point.

136
00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:30.600
-Thanos!
 --Habibi!

137
00:12:30.760 --> 00:12:35.640
The shoes, jacket and pants were something used during the 90's.

138
00:12:35.800 --> 00:12:41.280
But the winter jacket we did not start baking, I mean to buy, until ...

139
00:12:41.440 --> 00:12:44.440
... 00s.
 Congratulations to the score.

140
00:12:44.600 --> 00:12:50.720
- Peter, your turn.
 - Weera, now we do it together.

141
00:12:53.760 --> 00:12:59.320
Beckna means sales.
 You sell.

142
00:12:59.480 --> 00:13:04.880
Most often you refer to cannabis and other forms of drugs.

143
00:13:05.040 --> 00:13:10.920
A longer, you might say, or Santa Claus maybe others call it.

144
00:13:11.080 --> 00:13:16.520
–Oda definitions.
 -Thanks.
 So true.
 It is right.

145
00:13:16.680 --> 00:13:21.440
- Yes, I say.
 - Congratulations, the man.
 Clearly you get points.

146
00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:30.600
- Good worked, Peter.
 - Lisa?
 –Evelyn.

147
00:13:30.760 --> 00:13:32.840
Hello!

148
00:13:42.480 --> 00:13:46.240
He has a very giant name.

149
00:13:46.400 --> 00:13:49.360
I don't remember it, so I read it.

150
00:13:49.520 --> 00:13:54.600
I think it's African, but I'll read this.

151
00:13:54.760 --> 00:13:58.280
-Are you ready?
 -Yes.

152
00:13:58.440 --> 00:14:04.600
Rochandienelyshiaonnevehesh ...

153
00:14:04.760 --> 00:14:07.920
Walla.
 She calls demons, the man.

154
00:14:14.720 --> 00:14:20.440
I felt the same.
 I just: Is that the beginning of The Grudge, right?

155
00:14:20.600 --> 00:14:23.720
These are dancing demons.

156
00:14:23.880 --> 00:14:28.880
-Okay, continues.
 - Fuck, is it longer?

157
00:14:29.040 --> 00:14:34.040
- Has the Swedish Tax Agency not said no?
 - It's long.
 Okay...

158
00:14:34.200 --> 00:14:38.560
- Should I take it from the beginning?
 - No, we only have 28 minutes.

159
00:14:38.720 --> 00:14:40.760
Nickname only.

160
00:14:40.920 --> 00:14:47.040
Koyannishkoyati ... Koyannishkoyatsius ...

161
00:14:47.200 --> 00:14:51.200
Do you know what, Evelyn?
 So you don't get a stroke ...

162
00:14:51.360 --> 00:14:54.360
Good work.
 - An applause to Evelyn.

163
00:14:58.160 --> 00:15:03.320
- Lis, what do you say?
 - I have difficulty with artist names.

164
00:15:03.480 --> 00:15:06.280
So that...

165
00:15:07.160 --> 00:15:12.320
Yes, that is true.
 Who finds ...?
 Or?

166
00:15:12.480 --> 00:15:17.200
You believe ... at what Evelyn just read for you?

167
00:15:17.360 --> 00:15:21.320
- Well!
 - Is it Califfa's name?

168
00:15:21.480 --> 00:15:25.800
- It's false.
 - Obviously as hell it is false.

169
00:15:31.240 --> 00:15:36.120
There was nothing African in the name at all.

170
00:15:36.280 --> 00:15:42.240
Kaliffa's real name is Olle Kaliffa Karlsson.

171
00:15:42.400 --> 00:15:46.880
Unfortunately, Peter, you have no chance to move on to the final.

172
00:15:47.040 --> 00:15:51.560
But Johan, you can bring home full pot.

173
00:15:51.720 --> 00:15:55.720
Time to ask the last question in the first round.

174
00:15:55.880 --> 00:16:01.320
- To Chang.
 --Le Chang.

175
00:16:04.120 --> 00:16:07.640
A religious question in the SD country Skåne.

176
00:16:07.800 --> 00:16:13.880
There are two pilgrim walks.
 One goes to Ullared, one to Thailand.

177
00:16:14.040 --> 00:16:18.960
When you go to Thailand, you know - the lady on the purchase.

178
00:16:19.120 --> 00:16:23.480
The largest group in Sweden is Thai.
 I swear, the man.

179
00:16:26.360 --> 00:16:28.360
No.

180
00:16:32.480 --> 00:16:35.280
I don't believe in that.

181
00:16:35.440 --> 00:16:41.080
You don't believe in Chang.
 You do that right in. It's false.

182
00:16:44.240 --> 00:16:47.760
The correct answer is women born in Syria.

183
00:16:47.920 --> 00:16:52.120
86 822 persons were counted in 2021.

184
00:16:52.280 --> 00:16:57.280
They have passed the Finns which today are in second place.

185
00:16:58.880 --> 00:17:04.560
That, my ladies and gentlemen, means that Lisa and Johan go to the final!

186
00:17:06.560 --> 00:17:10.280
A large applause to Peter who is allowed to leave us now.

187
00:17:10.440 --> 00:17:15.400
Fun to have you with.
 It wasn't enough.
 Thanks.
 - An applause to Peter!

188
00:17:19.320 --> 00:17:23.360
Now, my ladies and gentlemen, it's time for the final round.

189
00:17:23.520 --> 00:17:25.840
First to five points.

190
00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:30.000
But there is a twist during the final.

191
00:17:30.160 --> 00:17:35.040
If you answer a question incorrectly, the opponent gets the point.

192
00:17:35.200 --> 00:17:39.880
Johan, when you won the first round you start the final.

193
00:17:40.040 --> 00:17:42.480
Camilla.

194
00:17:42.640 --> 00:17:46.760
Here was tried.
 We knew that.
 Good there.

195
00:17:51.560 --> 00:17:56.840
/ Whistles/ shit!
 It is happening now.

196
00:17:57.000 --> 00:18:01.960
I'm probably the worst immigrant in this group.

197
00:18:02.120 --> 00:18:04.960
It's not something I consume.

198
00:18:05.120 --> 00:18:11.880
I have heard that it is sunflower seeds that they eat and sprinkles around them.

199
00:18:12.040 --> 00:18:15.360
Immigrant chips, also called.

200
00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:24.600
- Pipas.
 -It sounds good.

201
00:18:24.760 --> 00:18:30.680
- But I think you are lying.
 - Maybe it, maybe so.

202
00:18:30.840 --> 00:18:33.680
- You think Camilla is lying?
 -Unfortunately.

203
00:18:33.840 --> 00:18:39.560
- You don't think Ortenfolk likes chips?
 - I'm convinced.

204
00:18:39.720 --> 00:18:44.400
There you did away with it.
 Camilla did not lie at all.

205
00:18:49.000 --> 00:18:54.240
Pipas, as many here know, are sunflower seeds.

206
00:18:54.400 --> 00:18:58.560
Johan, you didn't just miss a point.

207
00:18:58.720 --> 00:19:01.400
Without Lisa, Lisa got a point.

208
00:19:05.320 --> 00:19:10.320
- What do you choose as the first panelist?
 - Petrina.

209
00:19:15.920 --> 00:19:20.120
Swedish women after a trip to Gambia.

210
00:19:31.080 --> 00:19:35.920
It is Gambia's largest export product.
 No one there has them.

211
00:19:36.080 --> 00:19:39.280
Only Swedish women have them.

212
00:19:39.440 --> 00:19:46.640
This is then ... I think it's the Cocalero Indians from Bolivia-

213
00:19:46.800 --> 00:19:51.000
- As you sometimes see playing at city festivals.
 It's their national costume.

214
00:19:51.160 --> 00:19:55.840
It's Latin American.
 Not African, as you might think.

215
00:19:56.000 --> 00:20:01.160
I have a mom who has traveled a bit in Africa ...

216
00:20:07.400 --> 00:20:09.440
But...

217
00:20:10.480 --> 00:20:15.880
Lisa was such a bit from getting in that dress today.

218
00:20:17.760 --> 00:20:21.840
There is a risk that I will do away with confidence.

219
00:20:22.000 --> 00:20:26.320
- But I say you are lying.
 - You think Petrina is lying?

220
00:20:26.480 --> 00:20:29.840
Obviously Petrina is lying.

221
00:20:34.320 --> 00:20:38.760
2–0.
 False.
 It is a Somali dress called Baati.

222
00:20:38.920 --> 00:20:43.720
In the past you only had it at home, nowadays you also go out in it.

223
00:20:43.880 --> 00:20:48.040
It's comfort clothes.
 - Johan?

224
00:20:48.200 --> 00:20:53.320
Which of our panelists would you like to talk to?

225
00:20:53.480 --> 00:20:57.120
Think gold.
 Gold Penis.

226
00:21:02.080 --> 00:21:04.360
Behrad, my brother.

227
00:21:11.320 --> 00:21:16.960
That's when the eldest son has been able to afford to buy his first BMW.

228
00:21:17.120 --> 00:21:18.840
No.

229
00:21:19.000 --> 00:21:24.800
Nowruz is a ceremony that you have after the male circumcision.

230
00:21:24.960 --> 00:21:31.000
It means taking the bit you got, it can be of gold -

231
00:21:31.160 --> 00:21:35.320
–And put it in a special type of bowl ...

232
00:21:35.480 --> 00:21:37.480
I hear that this sounds strange.

233
00:21:37.640 --> 00:21:43.240
Then you light candles around the bowl and sing songs.

234
00:21:43.400 --> 00:21:46.160
Then you send around it in the family -

235
00:21:46.320 --> 00:21:50.920
- And so everyone can say their wishes to it.

236
00:21:51.080 --> 00:21:54.680
-What do you feel?
 - It sounds solemn.

237
00:21:54.840 --> 00:21:58.520
We have something similar in midsummer.

238
00:21:58.680 --> 00:22:03.640
- Sprinkle around foreskin into a bowl?
 -Yes.
 But it is not called so.

239
00:22:03.800 --> 00:22:09.000
The small frogs, the small frogs are funny to see

240
00:22:09.160 --> 00:22:12.320
-Just.
 - But you dance around a cock after all.

241
00:22:12.480 --> 00:22:17.000
-Yes kind of.
 - Check you who have taught your Swedish culture.

242
00:22:18.600 --> 00:22:21.480
Good black shells.

243
00:22:23.800 --> 00:22:27.160
-True or false?
 - False.
 I have to get a point now.

244
00:22:27.320 --> 00:22:32.920
Sure it's false.
 Congratulations, you've got a point.

245
00:22:35.000 --> 00:22:39.960
--Nowruz is New Year's Eve.
 Ish.
 -Yes.

246
00:22:40.120 --> 00:22:43.080
I love how specific we are.

247
00:22:43.240 --> 00:22:48.400
New Year's Eve.
 Nowruz falls on the spring day equation and is celebrated for 18 days.

248
00:22:48.560 --> 00:22:53.360
- Lice, who do you choose?
 - I choose Hassan.

249
00:23:01.760 --> 00:23:06.000
Dishdashe is ... sorry, all Arabs out there, all men.

250
00:23:06.160 --> 00:23:11.280
But they hate to wash and be in the kitchen.
 I think everyone agrees.

251
00:23:11.440 --> 00:23:16.800
And it's half English, half Arabic, where the dish is disk -

252
00:23:16.960 --> 00:23:20.480
–And Dash means hatred.
 It's disk hat.

253
00:23:21.640 --> 00:23:28.320
It is common at Arabs to say Dishdashe.
 Men should not wash.

254
00:23:28.480 --> 00:23:33.400
It has become a thing and it has come to Europe.

255
00:23:33.560 --> 00:23:38.480
- My guy.
 - And I love it.

256
00:23:39.520 --> 00:23:46.440
It sounded a little too easy to be true.
 So I think you are lying.

257
00:23:46.600 --> 00:23:50.720
Lisa, you do it right in. Clearly Hassan is lying.

258
00:23:52.120 --> 00:23:56.240
Dishdashe is a traditional Arab costume.
 - Johan?

259
00:23:56.400 --> 00:23:59.840
Time for you to shine again.
 Who do you choose?

260
00:24:00.000 --> 00:24:02.680
–Alaf.
 - Yeah!

261
00:24:08.360 --> 00:24:14.600
Swedish snoopes are in 24th place in size.

262
00:24:18.200 --> 00:24:22.160
Danes, because they are such fucking cocks.

263
00:24:29.280 --> 00:24:35.240
No, according to recent statistics this year, it is Ecuador in South America -

264
00:24:35.400 --> 00:24:41.720
- So has the longest, and that is then in erected state.

265
00:24:41.880 --> 00:24:46.040
Permission?
 You say so?
 Stand.
 Shit the same.

266
00:24:46.200 --> 00:24:49.200
It's type 18 centimeters.
 Ish.

267
00:24:49.360 --> 00:24:52.800
But not in gold?

268
00:24:54.480 --> 00:24:58.000
It's far.

269
00:24:58.160 --> 00:25:03.320
Also feels like someone from Ecuador has written the survey.

270
00:25:03.480 --> 00:25:08.920
-What are you saying?
 - This must be false.

271
00:25:10.440 --> 00:25:15.080
- You don't trust Elaf's cock knowledge?
 -No I do not think so...

272
00:25:15.240 --> 00:25:19.600
- Unfortunately, Johan.
 It's true.
 - Aaha!

273
00:25:19.760 --> 00:25:24.280
I like that the whole audience was like this: "Wait a minute!"

274
00:25:24.440 --> 00:25:28.760
/ Piper/ Ecuador!
 I'll go there.

275
00:25:28.920 --> 00:25:31.280
Me too.

276
00:25:32.880 --> 00:25:38.480
Because you answered wrong, it means that Lisa got another point.

277
00:25:44.160 --> 00:25:49.720
If you are observant and your math is on top, you will see you have 4 points.

278
00:25:49.880 --> 00:25:55.080
The final is first to 5. Reply correctly, so you have won the entire competition.

279
00:25:55.240 --> 00:26:01.080
- Much of games.
 Who should you trust?
 - Who do you choose to put the cards on?

280
00:26:01.240 --> 00:26:05.480
Maybe I should trust Hassan's judgment on Filip.

281
00:26:05.640 --> 00:26:08.240
Thank you!

282
00:26:17.520 --> 00:26:19.880
Were you forced?

283
00:26:20.040 --> 00:26:23.880
Hijab just covers the hair.
 Okay.

284
00:26:24.040 --> 00:26:29.520
Niqab covers everything except the eyes.
 Imagine Ninja Turtles reverse.

285
00:26:29.680 --> 00:26:33.240
Hello!
 Superstar, superninja here.

286
00:26:33.400 --> 00:26:38.160
While a can cover everything.
 Think hide and seek.

287
00:26:38.320 --> 00:26:41.920
- Eyes too.
 - Giantbra.
 Show again.

288
00:26:42.080 --> 00:26:46.640
Blind.
 Peekaboo!

289
00:26:46.800 --> 00:26:50.720
You are the most educational duo I met.

290
00:26:55.160 --> 00:27:01.840
It feels sunny.
 I think that's true.

291
00:27:02.000 --> 00:27:06.480
Filip gave you the truth.
 Congratulations, Lisa.
 You have a point!

292
00:27:06.640 --> 00:27:10.360
Not only that.
 You won the whole competition!

293
00:27:16.680 --> 00:27:20.480
Applause for tonight's winner Lisa!

294
00:27:21.960 --> 00:27:26.840
You don't go from here empty -handed.
 You get your IFS diploma.

295
00:27:27.000 --> 00:27:29.880
And a flower.

296
00:27:30.040 --> 00:27:35.200
Give a huge applause to our competitors, this fantastic audience -

297
00:27:35.360 --> 00:27:40.360
- To your home and last but not least our incredible panel!

298
00:27:40.520 --> 00:27:43.760
Thank you to all of you who have looked.
 Feel the best!

299
00:27:46.640 --> 00:27:49.680
