00:00:00.175 --> 00:00:03.225
Hello to you today i will show you how to bake

2
00:00:03.225 --> 00:00:06.135
Really good bran.

3
00:00:06.445 --> 00:00:07.445
-—-—-

4
00:00:07.545 --> 00:00:08.545
-—-—-

5
00:00:09.875 --> 00:00:10.925
-—-—-

6
00:00:16.165 --> 00:00:18.585
The perfect bran in my opinion

7
00:00:18.585 --> 00:00:21.815
consists of an airy bun bun,

8
00:00:21.815 --> 00:00:26.800
nutty almond paste with a little chew resistance and fluffy whipped cream.and one (semla)

9
00:00:26.975 --> 00:00:29.775
That's what I will show you how to bake today.

10
00:00:29.775 --> 00:00:32.655
And what you need to bake the perfect

11
00:00:32.655 --> 00:00:34.055
The bran is:

12
00:00:34.715 --> 00:00:37.625
room -temperature butter, salt, wheat flour,

13
00:00:37.625 --> 00:00:40.455
eggs, fresh yeast,

14
00:00:40.455 --> 00:00:43.305
milk, sweet almond, cardamom,

15
00:00:43.305 --> 00:00:46.065
Water and icing sugar.
 And that I will

16
00:00:46.065 --> 00:00:49.525
Start with, it is to crumble the yeast in a bowl.

17
00:00:57.625 --> 00:01:03.400
And this should only be stirred together until the yeast has dissolved in the milk before I have in any other ingredients.

18
00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:04.540
-—-—-

19
00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:13.580
So now the yeast has dissolved in the milk

20
00:01:13.620 --> 00:01:16.385
and i'll go down with powdered sugar

21
00:01:16.385 --> 00:01:19.115
As I don't think I mentioned

22
00:01:19.115 --> 00:01:21.805
When I stabbed the ingredients earlier.

23
00:01:21.805 --> 00:01:24.805
But at least it should be sugar in this dough.

24
00:01:24.805 --> 00:01:27.755
Two eggs.
 As you can exclude if you want but

25
00:01:27.755 --> 00:01:29.635
They give a little extra juiciness to the bun.

26
00:01:32.765 --> 00:01:35.685
A must for the bran: Cardamom

27
00:01:35.685 --> 00:01:38.225
This is ready -ground but

28
00:01:38.225 --> 00:01:42.000
If you want even more cardamom flavor, then you take entire cardamom seeds and mortar.

29
00:01:44.385 --> 00:01:47.445
Room -temperature butter.

30
00:01:47.445 --> 00:01:49.745
I don't know if you've noticed it yet

31
00:01:49.745 --> 00:01:52.925
But so far all my ingredients have been room -temperature.

32
00:01:52.925 --> 00:01:55.875
The milk, the yeast, the eggs and now the butter.

33
00:01:55.875 --> 00:01:58.865
It is partly for the sake of fermentation.

34
00:01:58.865 --> 00:02:01.395
But when it comes to the butter, it is important

35
00:02:01.395 --> 00:02:04.595
that it is room -temperature for if you melt the butter

36
00:02:04.595 --> 00:02:06.825
does it become a fluid and the more fluid you have

37
00:02:06.825 --> 00:02:09.985
the more wheat flour you need in the dough

38
00:02:09.985 --> 00:02:12.595
and a dough that contains a lot of wheat flour

39
00:02:12.595 --> 00:02:15.955
becomes much more compact since it has been baked and we want

40
00:02:15.955 --> 00:02:18.815
An airy bun bun so we use room -temperature butter.

41
00:02:18.815 --> 00:02:19.845
-—-—-

42
00:02:20.215 --> 00:02:23.245
And then i have in half of the flour

43
00:02:23.245 --> 00:02:28.500
And a little salt.
 But the salt and the rest of the flour we save until later

44
00:02:28.625 --> 00:02:33.000
Because we do not want the salt to make direct contact with the yeast because then it disturbs the fermentation process.

45
00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:36.675
Then we don't want to have all wheat flour at once,

46
00:02:36.675 --> 00:02:39.675
Without a little at a time so we get a messy but still manageable dough.

47
00:02:39.675 --> 00:02:42.615
Then the buns become the airiest.

48
00:02:44.065 --> 00:02:46.945
Such something.
 Now I just hip

49
00:02:46.945 --> 00:02:49.785
Because I did this so many times but accurate instructions and dimensions

50
00:02:49.785 --> 00:02:52.115
For how much flour and other ingredients

51
00:02:52.115 --> 00:02:55.165
As you need, you will find that as usual in the description.

52
00:02:55.165 --> 00:02:57.735
There is a direct link to the recipe.

53
00:03:12.935 --> 00:03:15.135
Like this now when the dough slowly

54
00:03:15.135 --> 00:03:18.055
but surely have started to go together to a messy batter then I have in a little

55
00:03:18.055 --> 00:03:21.395
Salt and even more flour.
 And as you see

56
00:03:21.825 --> 00:03:24.835
so i have in a little flour at a time so i see exactly when it goes together to

57
00:03:24.835 --> 00:03:27.445
a manageable dough and never cross the limit

58
00:03:27.445 --> 00:03:29.955
to this compact and

59
00:03:29.955 --> 00:03:32.975
Thick the dough that just becomes a dry and dull bun.

60
00:03:47.965 --> 00:03:50.535
The dough, it should be kneaded for at least 10 minutes

61
00:03:50.545 --> 00:03:53.585
in machine or double if you do it by hand.

62
00:03:53.585 --> 00:03:56.635
And that is because we really want to activate the gluten in the dough

63
00:03:56.635 --> 00:03:59.675
so that we get these airy and juicy buns that

64
00:03:59.675 --> 00:04:02.715
Raise well in the oven.
 So don't skimp on the kneading

65
00:04:02.715 --> 00:04:05.825
Although I know it is the most boring thing in this whole process.

66
00:04:05.825 --> 00:04:07.775
But it's worth it, I promise

67
00:04:19.495 --> 00:04:22.575
When the dough releases from the edges of the bowl

68
00:04:22.575 --> 00:04:26.035
Then it is ready to be formed into buns.

69
00:04:26.305 --> 00:04:29.055
You see how easily it attaches to the hook

70
00:04:29.325 --> 00:04:31.645
Without stuck in the bowl.
 Then you know

71
00:04:31.645 --> 00:04:33.115
That then it is really done.

72
00:04:33.675 --> 00:04:36.685
Like that now you divide the part into the same number of parts

73
00:04:36.685 --> 00:04:39.765
As you want buns.
 Do you want to make big bran

74
00:04:39.765 --> 00:04:42.315
So you do it.
 Medium -sized or small.

75
00:04:42.315 --> 00:04:45.325
It's all up to you.
 Want to weigh your buns before

76
00:04:45.325 --> 00:04:48.575
You bake them so you can do it.
 One usually says that

77
00:04:48.875 --> 00:04:52.015
30 g of dough per bun gives minis selection

78
00:04:52.205 --> 00:04:55.305
Or 60 g of dough if you want to do ...

79
00:04:55.305 --> 00:04:58.625
Such there are ordinary ... who usually be in cafes ...

80
00:04:58.775 --> 00:05:01.055
The most common

81
00:05:01.065 --> 00:05:03.675
the size of the bran.
 That's about

82
00:05:03.675 --> 00:05:06.675
60 g per bun.

83
00:05:06.675 --> 00:05:09.165
It's about this size.

84
00:05:09.165 --> 00:05:10.475
So you have something to compare with at home.

85
00:05:23.975 --> 00:05:26.775
Now the dough is divided into the same number of pieces

86
00:05:26.775 --> 00:05:30.025
Like I want buns.
 They weigh exactly as much

87
00:05:30.025 --> 00:05:32.445
Which is wonderful

88
00:05:32.445 --> 00:05:35.295
And now it's time to shape them into buns.

89
00:05:35.295 --> 00:05:38.275
Now you want a resilient bun that is

90
00:05:38.285 --> 00:05:40.325
Nice and smooth rolled.
 The trick behind it

91
00:05:40.325 --> 00:05:42.945
is simply to curse your hand

92
00:05:42.945 --> 00:05:45.115
around the bun and pushes slightly lightly

93
00:05:45.115 --> 00:05:47.765
while rotating your hand.

94
00:05:48.745 --> 00:05:51.965
One pushes it as well as towards the table, couples the hand

95
00:05:51.965 --> 00:05:54.865
and rotates at the same time.

96
00:05:54.865 --> 00:05:57.825
It doesn't have to go fast.
 And then you do this until you feel that

97
00:05:59.165 --> 00:06:02.455
There is no joint on the bun.

98
00:06:02.585 --> 00:06:05.575
And this is just repeating for all of them, yes

99
00:06:05.595 --> 00:06:08.635
30 buns you have in front of you to roll.
 Twice as many

100
00:06:08.635 --> 00:06:10.055
If you make mini seems.

101
00:06:15.845 --> 00:06:19.265
Now the buns are shaped and ready to be fermented

102
00:06:19.265 --> 00:06:22.255
and is it that you don't want to bake all the buns the same day

103
00:06:22.255 --> 00:06:25.515
Then you can actually freeze them uncoated

104
00:06:25.515 --> 00:06:28.725
And unequal just before fermentation.

105
00:06:28.725 --> 00:06:31.535
Because in normal order I ferment my wheat doughs

106
00:06:31.535 --> 00:06:34.215
only once.
 And that is because if

107
00:06:34.215 --> 00:06:36.925
We will now take this up with the fermentation again:

108
00:06:36.925 --> 00:06:39.735
(But it's so important)

109
00:06:39.735 --> 00:06:42.635
So it is very bad for the fermentation if you ferment it for a little while

110
00:06:42.635 --> 00:06:45.545
And then you start to knead in the dough just like I did now [when I split the dough into pieces]

111
00:06:45.695 --> 00:06:48.815
And then ferment again.
 Then you have swamped it

112
00:06:48.815 --> 00:06:51.545
You ferment once.
 And the advantage of that

113
00:06:51.545 --> 00:06:54.555
In addition to being very good fermentation on the dough,

114
00:06:54.555 --> 00:06:57.635
It is that you can do this to freeze the buns

115
00:06:57.635 --> 00:07:00.355
Before they ferment and baked

116
00:07:00.355 --> 00:07:03.405
And then you can take out and thaw and ferment

117
00:07:03.405 --> 00:07:06.215
Whenever you are craving.
 So you don't have to

118
00:07:06.215 --> 00:07:09.155
Stand and make a new dough every time.
 So I cover them here with a back cloth now.

119
00:07:10.305 --> 00:07:13.085
So that they can ferment in peace and quiet.

120
00:07:13.085 --> 00:07:15.435
At least 2 hours.

121
00:07:16.405 --> 00:07:19.425
Now is the time to make the almond paste and personally so love

122
00:07:19.425 --> 00:07:21.985
I am almond pulp.
 And almost takes a little bad up

123
00:07:21.985 --> 00:07:24.825
If someone has stabbed the almond paste

124
00:07:24.825 --> 00:07:27.645
When I get served a holiday.
 Much almond paste it should be

125
00:07:27.645 --> 00:07:28.645
And the best I think, it will be

126
00:07:29.305 --> 00:07:32.085
When rusting the sweet almond before mixing

127
00:07:32.085 --> 00:07:35.075
it together into an almond paste for then you get forward

128
00:07:35.075 --> 00:07:38.125
An even more nutty and good taste.

129
00:07:38.125 --> 00:07:41.075
So i'm going to spread the sweet almonds here on a baking sheet paper on a plate

130
00:07:41.075 --> 00:07:44.055
and roast in the middle of the oven at 175 degrees

131
00:07:44.055 --> 00:07:46.345
for about 10 min.

132
00:07:49.825 --> 00:07:52.805
Thus, roasted sweet almonds smell so good

133
00:07:52.805 --> 00:07:55.935
And I should actually have in them directly

134
00:07:55.935 --> 00:07:58.995
In my food processor and mix them properly

135
00:07:58.995 --> 00:08:02.035
Before I go in with icing sugar and some water.

136
00:08:02.035 --> 00:08:04.935
I don't usually scale my sweet almonds because I think it's good.

137
00:08:04.935 --> 00:08:07.945
There is no reason to scale them but do you want

138
00:08:07.945 --> 00:08:10.645
so you can either buy pre -roasted and peeled

139
00:08:10.645 --> 00:08:12.755
Or you rub them with a kitchen towel

140
00:08:12.755 --> 00:08:15.695
When they are just pre -roasted

141
00:08:15.695 --> 00:08:17.835
Then the shell falls off super light.

142
00:08:19.715 --> 00:08:21.475
I prefer an almond paste with some chew resistance

143
00:08:21.475 --> 00:08:24.315
So I don't mix the nuts completely.

144
00:08:24.315 --> 00:08:26.065
But it is entirely up to you how you want to do.

145
00:08:34.695 --> 00:08:38.035
It smells so good.

146
00:08:38.035 --> 00:08:39.105
And so I have in the icing sugar.

147
00:08:40.195 --> 00:08:42.145
And a splash of water.

148
00:08:47.845 --> 00:08:49.995
I actually think I should have in some salt ...

149
00:08:50.975 --> 00:08:53.615
... and vanilla sugar

150
00:08:53.615 --> 00:08:56.275
Vanilla sugar is absolutely nothing must, now I just got feeling.

151
00:08:57.175 --> 00:09:00.315
Skip it if you don't have or don't want

152
00:09:00.315 --> 00:09:01.745
Vanilla sugar in your almond pulp.

153
00:09:02.415 --> 00:09:03.415
Here we go again.

154
00:09:06.115 --> 00:09:09.335
Now almond pulp has a perfect texture.

155
00:09:09.335 --> 00:09:12.365
The almond paste, I fill it up

156
00:09:12.415 --> 00:09:14.955
In an alcohol bag.
 So I just push down

157
00:09:14.955 --> 00:09:16.405
An alcohol bag like this in a glass.

158
00:09:16.905 --> 00:09:19.875
Then it becomes easier to fill it without scratching.

159
00:09:21.215 --> 00:09:24.095
And so the almond paste is allowed to stand and go here in

160
00:09:24.095 --> 00:09:26.535
the spirits bag until my

161
00:09:26.535 --> 00:09:29.385
Semmel buns are fermented, baked

162
00:09:29.385 --> 00:09:32.575
And the whipped cream whipped.

163
00:09:32.965 --> 00:09:35.365
Now it's a few hours later and my

164
00:09:35.365 --> 00:09:38.285
Semmel buns have yeast to almost

165
00:09:38.285 --> 00:09:40.635
More than twice as big.

166
00:09:40.635 --> 00:09:43.615
Which is perfect this will really be wonderfully fluffy

167
00:09:43.615 --> 00:09:46.775
And airy buns that I love.

168
00:09:46.775 --> 00:09:49.555
Now I will brush them with a mixture of

169
00:09:49.555 --> 00:09:52.575
eggs, water and salt.
 And why I have in water and salt

170
00:09:52.575 --> 00:09:55.405
in this mixture, it is for the egg not to clump

171
00:09:55.405 --> 00:09:58.255
so that we really get a nice brush

172
00:09:58.255 --> 00:09:59.255
on the buns.

173
00:09:59.965 --> 00:10:02.875
So I just break down the egg here.
 And so i have in

174
00:10:02.875 --> 00:10:05.835
some water.
 One just splashes, it's not so careful.

175
00:10:05.835 --> 00:10:08.165
And a little, a little salty.
 And whisk

176
00:10:08.165 --> 00:10:10.705
This gently together.

177
00:10:10.705 --> 00:10:13.455
Until it is not clumsy, but a smooth and yellow batter.

178
00:10:14.665 --> 00:10:17.625
That's how.
 Do you see completely lump -free so that

179
00:10:17.625 --> 00:10:20.185
We get a nice brush.
 And the worst thing I know,

180
00:10:20.185 --> 00:10:22.485
That's when it lumps.
 So do you have an omelette

181
00:10:22.485 --> 00:10:24.185
on his bun after baking.

182
00:10:37.005 --> 00:10:40.015
Now the buns are finished.
 And i bake them

183
00:10:40.015 --> 00:10:42.895
in the middle of the oven at 200 degrees,

184
00:10:42.895 --> 00:10:45.425
Over and under-heat for about 10-15 minutes.

185
00:10:45.425 --> 00:10:47.455
-—-—-

186
00:10:47.825 --> 00:10:50.735
When the buns are ready -baked so

187
00:10:50.735 --> 00:10:53.525
is it just to let them stand on a grid to cool

188
00:10:53.525 --> 00:10:55.155
Before we fill and decorate them.

189
00:11:00.765 --> 00:11:03.605
Now my ballets have cooled down and

190
00:11:03.605 --> 00:11:06.685
Become wonderfully soft and fine.
 That which remains now

191
00:11:06.685 --> 00:11:09.325
It is to get to a small lid, dig out,

192
00:11:09.325 --> 00:11:11.955
fill with almond paste,

193
00:11:11.955 --> 00:11:14.125
whipped cream and then decorate

194
00:11:14.125 --> 00:11:16.825
with icing sugar.
 How easy and

195
00:11:16.825 --> 00:11:19.585
lovely as soon as and when I dig

196
00:11:19.655 --> 00:11:22.325
clock and make a lid for my bull buns,

197
00:11:22.325 --> 00:11:25.175
so i use a scissors like many others

198
00:11:25.175 --> 00:11:27.765
and the trick here is not to cut straight on the surface

199
00:11:27.765 --> 00:11:30.875
Without cutting into the bun

200
00:11:31.015 --> 00:11:32.425
-—-—-

201
00:11:33.025 --> 00:11:35.625
Because then you come while removing the lid

202
00:11:35.625 --> 00:11:38.635
even have dug out of the bun

203
00:11:38.635 --> 00:11:41.395
So you do not have to stand and dig in the bun to get the inside measurement.

204
00:11:42.665 --> 00:11:45.215
Like that, a triangular lid I think is the finest.

205
00:11:45.215 --> 00:11:48.445
So you get the inside of the bull bun.

206
00:11:48.445 --> 00:11:51.635
If you want, you can dig out with, but this I think is good.

207
00:11:51.635 --> 00:11:54.645
What is left over on the lid I usually remove.

208
00:12:13.685 --> 00:12:16.705
The buns have received a lid and been excavated.

209
00:12:16.705 --> 00:12:18.185
They may stand a little on the side while

210
00:12:18.505 --> 00:12:21.745
We whip the whipped cream.

211
00:12:21.955 --> 00:12:24.175
There is some stuff you need to think about

212
00:12:24.175 --> 00:12:26.985
To get an airy and lovely whipped cream for their bran.

213
00:12:26.985 --> 00:12:29.415
And the first one is

214
00:12:29.415 --> 00:12:32.115
That you use refrigerator shell whipped cream.

215
00:12:32.115 --> 00:12:35.045
It is easiest to whisk up, and one can whisk it longer

216
00:12:35.045 --> 00:12:38.105
than room -temperature whipped cream, without butter.

217
00:12:38.225 --> 00:12:41.315
Then you also don't want to whip the cream too much.

218
00:12:41.315 --> 00:12:44.035
For remember we should stop the whisked cream

219
00:12:44.035 --> 00:12:46.995
In an alcohol bag.
 And when one has in something in an alcohol bag

220
00:12:47.025 --> 00:12:49.845
Then it is further processed.

221
00:12:49.845 --> 00:12:51.995
For one is on your hands

222
00:12:51.995 --> 00:12:54.585
And the hands are a little warm.
 And have you already whipped it

223
00:12:54.585 --> 00:12:57.595
too hard.
 Then it comes

224
00:12:57.595 --> 00:12:58.775
to become butter -like and

225
00:12:58.775 --> 00:13:01.315
in all likelihood cut

226
00:13:01.315 --> 00:13:04.405
Before you can spread the cream.

227
00:13:04.405 --> 00:13:07.205
So refrigerator cold and not whisking too much.

228
00:13:07.205 --> 00:13:10.145
Then it is also good to whisk at slightly lower speed

229
00:13:10.145 --> 00:13:12.695
So that you get a lot of air into the cream.

230
00:13:12.695 --> 00:13:15.075
Do you whisk the cream quickly at high intensity

231
00:13:15.075 --> 00:13:17.575
so you won't get as much air into the whip cream

232
00:13:17.575 --> 00:13:20.505
Like when you whisk slowly.
 So the three tips

233
00:13:20.505 --> 00:13:22.805
Gives you a phenomenal cream to your bran.

234
00:13:30.625 --> 00:13:32.520
Like that now the whipped cream is whipped

235
00:13:32.575 --> 00:13:35.305
to soft tops and what remains

236
00:13:35.305 --> 00:13:37.275
Now is to fill the buns

237
00:13:37.275 --> 00:13:40.085
with almond pulp, whipped cream

238
00:13:40.085 --> 00:13:42.995
and then decorate with icing sugar

239
00:13:42.995 --> 00:13:43.995
Then it's just chopping in

240
00:14:09.665 --> 00:14:12.735
The Sems are clear and ready to be enjoyed

241
00:14:12.735 --> 00:14:15.835
And if you also want to try baking bran at home

242
00:14:15.865 --> 00:14:18.795
