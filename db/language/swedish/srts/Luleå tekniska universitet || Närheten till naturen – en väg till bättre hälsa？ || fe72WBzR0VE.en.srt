1
00:00:05,790 --> 00:00:09,423
Very funny that you are so many who come here and hope too -

2
00:00:09,448 --> 00:00:13,595
That you are many who sit and listen to this online.

3
00:00:13,751 --> 00:00:18,602
The title of our lecture, proximity to nature - has a way to better health?

4
00:00:18,627 --> 00:00:19,837
with question marks.

5
00:00:20,523 --> 00:00:24,110
It might also have the sub -heading, we are on the right track.

6
00:00:24,135 --> 00:00:27,087
Not least with the image you can see here.

7
00:00:27,813 --> 00:00:31,852
My name is Åsa Engström and I am, as I said, professor of nursing,

8
00:00:31,877 --> 00:00:33,813
Also subject representatives there.

9
00:00:35,306 --> 00:00:38,501
Also a nurse and worked primarily in intensive care

10
00:00:38,526 --> 00:00:41,204
And courses linked to it.

11
00:00:41,602 --> 00:00:47,570
And this with the importance of nature is something that is warm to me.

12
00:00:48,298 --> 00:00:52,313
And maybe a little contrast to the high -tech.

13
00:00:53,454 --> 00:00:57,585
Päivi and I work together on many issues linked to this.

14
00:00:57,610 --> 00:00:59,258
You may introduce yourself.

15
00:00:59,884 --> 00:01:04,368
Päivi Juuso is my name, assistant professor at the department of

16
00:01:04,393 --> 00:01:07,766
Nursing and medical technology.
 And just as Åsa says,

17
00:01:07,791 --> 00:01:13,258
Colleague and we have worked and work in many different projects together.

18
00:01:14,204 --> 00:01:18,704
I am a district nurse, primarily worked in sparsely populated areas.

19
00:01:18,729 --> 00:01:24,032
So this with nature is very close really, my everyday life -

20
00:01:24,057 --> 00:01:28,977
And my everyday life.
 It will be great fun -

21
00:01:29,002 --> 00:01:34,223
To give this lecture for you.
 And also welcomes all of you -

22
00:01:34,248 --> 00:01:36,841
on site and all of you on the web.

23
00:01:37,005 --> 00:01:38,043
null

24
00:01:38,068 --> 00:01:40,646
[Åsa:] Then we drive.
 [Päivi:] Then we drive.

25
00:01:41,514 --> 00:01:45,384
In the advertisement that was on the net and in the newspaper and such.

26
00:01:45,688 --> 00:01:48,087
We asked these questions.

27
00:01:48,615 --> 00:01:52,371
These are really the ones we will discuss during the lecture.

28
00:01:52,396 --> 00:01:55,474
We will also make attempts to answer them.

29
00:01:56,732 --> 00:02:00,154
First, we have, much indicates that animals and nature have a positive -

30
00:02:00,179 --> 00:02:04,044
impact on human health.
 But is that right?

31
00:02:04,904 --> 00:02:09,071
And does it matter what kind of nature we stay in?

32
00:02:09,717 --> 00:02:14,177
Increases well -being when we are in a forest or near water, -

33
00:02:14,202 --> 00:02:17,498
Or does it work just as well if we are in a park?

34
00:02:17,708 --> 00:02:21,149
And this with the importance of climate for health then?

35
00:02:21,477 --> 00:02:26,701
Finally, this is done with having care, care and rehabilitation outdoors.

36
00:02:26,726 --> 00:02:28,930
Is it really possible to implement?

37
00:02:29,248 --> 00:02:33,107
That is what we will discuss the next moment.

38
00:02:34,670 --> 00:02:38,005
[Päivi:] Yes, exactly.
 Then we get into this with, the animals really have -

39
00:02:38,030 --> 00:02:43,685
a positive impact on human health.
 How did you understand it, Åsa?

40
00:02:44,131 --> 00:02:49,146
[Åsa:] Yes, we are pretty much agreed that the animals have a very -

41
00:02:49,171 --> 00:02:52,251
Positive impact on our health.

42
00:02:53,123 --> 00:02:56,779
It can create one, what should we say, health and well -being -

43
00:02:56,804 --> 00:03:00,106
So everyday.
 To have a spinning cat -

44
00:03:00,131 --> 00:03:05,446
Or a dog near him, maybe we stress down, that we relax.

45
00:03:05,592 --> 00:03:09,208
There are also very good effects when it comes to clean, -

46
00:03:09,233 --> 00:03:13,193
What should we say, in terms of treatment.
 This with that, -

47
00:03:14,256 --> 00:03:19,537
a dog or cat or a pet.
 Can be both comfort when we are -

48
00:03:19,562 --> 00:03:22,552
lonely and sad.
 A company.

49
00:03:23,451 --> 00:03:27,560
It trains us to have social interactions with others.

50
00:03:28,107 --> 00:03:32,857
And in many ways there are both evidence and example -

51
00:03:32,882 --> 00:03:35,857
On the fact that, this is useful for our health.

52
00:03:36,896 --> 00:03:41,888
There are also a lot of theories around the importance of animals.

53
00:03:41,913 --> 00:03:47,122
Many of them just show that we can get a sense of context -

54
00:03:47,147 --> 00:03:51,368
when we have animals.
 Also a meaningfulness.

55
00:03:51,766 --> 00:03:54,958
It becomes a different meaning to go out and go, when we have a dog -

56
00:03:54,983 --> 00:03:58,490
that we should go out and join.
 Than just go out and go and so on.

57
00:03:58,515 --> 00:04:01,466
So there are really good effects of this.

58
00:04:01,491 --> 00:04:05,794
Horse therapy is something we will show examples of, and so on.

59
00:04:06,630 --> 00:04:09,490
You also know that there is something called effect models.

60
00:04:09,515 --> 00:04:12,888
So precisely that oxytocin, the hormone that makes us feel good, -

61
00:04:12,913 --> 00:04:15,552
increases with animals.

62
00:04:15,889 --> 00:04:21,154
So in many ways, touch, closeness and a company.

63
00:04:22,060 --> 00:04:25,701
In addition, we know that you have animals, especially for example, -

64
00:04:25,726 --> 00:04:28,982
dog or horse.
 We move much more.

65
00:04:29,007 --> 00:04:32,240
It is also a health effect.
 [Päivi:] mm, exactly.

66
00:04:32,265 --> 00:04:37,052
And even if we did not, you mentioned a little with animals in healthcare, for example.

67
00:04:37,077 --> 00:04:42,115
So there is also the kind of interaction between animals and human, - -

68
00:04:42,140 --> 00:04:44,701
right?
 [Åsa:] Absolutely.
 That's how it is.

69
00:04:44,726 --> 00:04:47,118
Which is of great importance.

70
00:04:47,476 --> 00:04:49,474
We will also mention this with, for example, -

71
00:04:49,499 --> 00:04:52,654
The importance of being able to be on a farm, among animals.

72
00:04:52,679 --> 00:04:57,318
And what it can add.
 So as I said, answer yes.

73
00:04:58,068 --> 00:05:00,740
[Päivi:] Exactly.
 Exactly.

74
00:05:00,765 --> 00:05:03,373
[Åsa:] But if we continue.
 We also had this with -

75
00:05:03,398 --> 00:05:07,145
Nature as such.
 If it has any positive impact -

76
00:05:07,170 --> 00:05:09,466
on human health.

77
00:05:10,537 --> 00:05:14,162
[Åsa:] Is there any evidence for it?
 [Päivi:] Yes, exactly.
 Yes.

78
00:05:14,187 --> 00:05:17,382
This is really a very interesting question.
 For it comes -

79
00:05:17,407 --> 00:05:22,794
Most often natural, for many of us, the nature has behind the corner.

80
00:05:22,819 --> 00:05:26,169
Or at least in this part of the country.

81
00:05:26,482 --> 00:05:30,044
Then it is that, when we talk about nature, we can mean them -

82
00:05:30,071 --> 00:05:35,443
Natural environments.
 Thus, environments that are untouched by man.

83
00:05:35,467 --> 00:05:40,732
Which becomes more like a wilderness.
 But we can also mean natural environments, -

84
00:05:41,571 --> 00:05:44,688
which are constructed.
 Like parks, for example.

85
00:05:45,318 --> 00:05:49,771
And that is in close connection, for example to cities, if we say -

86
00:05:49,796 --> 00:05:55,193
Like here.
 And yes absolutely, on Åsa's question we could say that, -

87
00:05:55,218 --> 00:05:59,318
It has been found that nature has a bearing on health.

88
00:05:59,343 --> 00:06:03,099
But what significance it has, actually has to do with it.

89
00:06:03,131 --> 00:06:07,583
How it is provided.
 What does nature look like, what is it for nature, -

90
00:06:07,950 --> 00:06:11,732
We will get more into it.
 And how far from us is.

91
00:06:11,757 --> 00:06:15,193
So what accessibility do we have to nature.

92
00:06:15,389 --> 00:06:19,544
Historically, for example, we know that even Hippocrates -

93
00:06:19,569 --> 00:06:24,115
Built hospitals on open spaces and by lakes.

94
00:06:24,140 --> 00:06:27,279
Just to have access to nature.
 And man as a patient -

95
00:06:27,304 --> 00:06:31,738
could roam in nature and thus also find a balance.

96
00:06:31,763 --> 00:06:36,458
In them here, then you talked a lot about these fluids in the body.

97
00:06:36,483 --> 00:06:42,302
So you find a balance between what is sick and what is not sick.

98
00:06:42,327 --> 00:06:46,232
So you find health there.
 So there are a lot of people -

99
00:06:46,380 --> 00:06:50,607
Such descriptions.
 Also our guru, Florence Nightingale.

100
00:06:50,961 --> 00:06:54,771
Have also lifted it historically when you look at it.

101
00:06:54,796 --> 00:07:00,396
That there was a value of being in nature and having access to nature, -

102
00:07:00,421 --> 00:07:04,443
With fresh air and so on.
 When looking at pure evidence, -

103
00:07:04,468 --> 00:07:08,568
Then you see that, what you can say is that the light is important.

104
00:07:08,593 --> 00:07:12,927
The light and also, what to say, the distance.

105
00:07:12,952 --> 00:07:17,669
So, for example, you train your eye very early to look at longer distances as well.

106
00:07:17,694 --> 00:07:20,638
Unlike how we do maybe today.

107
00:07:20,787 --> 00:07:26,513
And sound of course.
 And how the sound affects us.

108
00:07:26,873 --> 00:07:31,208
There you can also imagine that there is a difference between if there is noise -

109
00:07:31,233 --> 00:07:33,669
Or if we can hear birdwatchers.

110
00:07:35,076 --> 00:07:39,654
Of course, access to nature also promotes the conditions -

111
00:07:39,679 --> 00:07:42,255
for the physical activity.

112
00:07:42,280 --> 00:07:45,076
Then we have to remember, we don't always talk about physical activity -

113
00:07:45,101 --> 00:07:50,474
Like you have to jog or do something more heavy.

114
00:07:50,499 --> 00:07:53,662
But on the other hand, you come out and walk.

115
00:07:53,843 --> 00:07:56,865
And staying in nature, in one way or another.

116
00:07:56,890 --> 00:08:00,505
Staying in nature can also increase the interaction.

117
00:08:00,530 --> 00:08:04,357
I think we will come a little about this with interactions with people.

118
00:08:04,382 --> 00:08:06,958
But of course also animals, which Åsa was in.

119
00:08:06,983 --> 00:08:12,701
But the interaction with people is increasing and has increased, in connection with -

120
00:08:12,726 --> 00:08:17,404
Among other things, the pandemic that has been now.
 Outdoors we have that opportunity.

121
00:08:18,102 --> 00:08:22,224
All in all, it can also be said that, this relaxing environment.

122
00:08:22,249 --> 00:08:27,974
If we find it relaxing, our mental health really improves.

123
00:08:27,999 --> 00:08:34,083
And the proximity to these particular environments, promotes health -

124
00:08:34,521 --> 00:08:37,849
and well -being in humans.

125
00:08:39,982 --> 00:08:43,052
But then I think like this, it has any significance what type -

126
00:08:43,077 --> 00:08:45,646
by nature we stay in?
 [Päivi:] Yes, exactly.

127
00:08:45,671 --> 00:08:50,185
That has actually been studied.
 As you can see here, three different pictures.

128
00:08:50,669 --> 00:08:54,185
If you are used to being in the forest and nature, you may not think so much -

129
00:08:54,210 --> 00:08:57,162
That there is such a big difference in these pictures.

130
00:08:57,187 --> 00:08:59,958
But on the other hand, it has been found that, just if you look at -

131
00:08:59,983 --> 00:09:05,474
first picture.
 It is not so recovery or soothing, -

132
00:09:05,499 --> 00:09:10,373
The environment when it is dense forest, for example.
 Without man striving to have, -

133
00:09:10,398 --> 00:09:14,044
For example, as in the third picture, the open surface.
 It could be, -

134
00:09:14,069 --> 00:09:18,724
In addition to there is a path, also an opportunity for an open area -

135
00:09:18,749 --> 00:09:23,146
Or a lake.
 This has been possible to demonstrate this in research.

136
00:09:23,171 --> 00:09:28,255
That it is recovery.
 But we must not detract from - anyway -

137
00:09:28,280 --> 00:09:32,647
This with the importance of the parks.
 So when you in urban planning, -

138
00:09:32,672 --> 00:09:39,216
for example.
 Looking at, how to promote activity among one's population.

139
00:09:39,241 --> 00:09:43,318
So it is reasonable to have this in mind, - -

140
00:09:43,343 --> 00:09:47,294
That how the environment should have our cities around our cities.

141
00:09:47,947 --> 00:09:51,458
Then maybe these parks - maybe these parks -

142
00:09:52,158 --> 00:09:55,474
May be a little closer.
 So we also have access to them.

143
00:09:55,499 --> 00:09:59,802
Because it is precisely the open spaces that can be health promotion.

144
00:09:59,827 --> 00:10:03,451
There is also always a distinction between that, how close and how much -

145
00:10:03,476 --> 00:10:07,944
Noise is around.
 But that there is still an asset -

146
00:10:07,969 --> 00:10:09,771
At least to them here.

147
00:10:10,662 --> 00:10:16,076
Where we really also talk about the opportunity to recover -

148
00:10:16,101 --> 00:10:19,537
By, you usually talk about getting a feeling of -

149
00:10:19,562 --> 00:10:24,208
a context.
 But also an opportunity to hear others, -

150
00:10:24,233 --> 00:10:30,115
But still not have to interact.
 Depending on how we feel.

151
00:10:31,178 --> 00:10:38,145
So there is this one, you usually talk about, almost like you can pull away.

152
00:10:38,170 --> 00:10:40,451
But still is not completely alone.

153
00:10:40,834 --> 00:10:44,856
This is based on the theories that exist around this meaning -

154
00:10:44,881 --> 00:10:49,912
of nature and the impact of nature on our health.

155
00:10:51,247 --> 00:10:54,279
Do you have something where you want to add?
 [Åsa:] No, I think it's -

156
00:10:54,304 --> 00:10:57,177
Good things you raised.
 And the latest you mentioned, -

157
00:10:57,202 --> 00:11:00,802
There are Kaplan's theory among other things and there are more who have written.

158
00:11:00,827 --> 00:11:02,968
I thought, you mentioned it with the importance of light.

159
00:11:02,993 --> 00:11:08,337
There you have also seen a lot of the importance of vitamin D, which we know is -

160
00:11:08,362 --> 00:11:10,946
Useful in many ways.
 [Päivi:] Yes, exactly.

161
00:11:10,971 --> 00:11:12,857
[Åsa:] and may have become even more relevant.
 That one has -

162
00:11:12,882 --> 00:11:14,802
Noticed it more recently.
 [Päivi:] Yes.

163
00:11:14,827 --> 00:11:17,958
And it is interesting to think, because Åsa addresses this with Kaplan's theory.

164
00:11:17,983 --> 00:11:23,052
They by chance came into this with that, in the 70s and 80s -

165
00:11:23,077 --> 00:11:27,130
It was enough, in the United States.
 Were allowed to join when people were taken out -

166
00:11:27,155 --> 00:11:29,607
in the wilderness.

167
00:11:31,100 --> 00:11:36,146
Where through their observations discovered that, it is not all nature -

168
00:11:36,171 --> 00:11:40,044
And all the environment that is, if says, restorative you talk about, -

169
00:11:40,069 --> 00:11:43,583
But recovery.
 Without it also had a meaning -

170
00:11:43,608 --> 00:11:48,404
If we could turn off stimuli from the surroundings.

171
00:11:48,429 --> 00:11:54,833
And there in the wilderness can feel that you relax.

172
00:11:54,858 --> 00:11:59,802
And allow to be fascinated by the environment that is around us.

173
00:12:00,654 --> 00:12:02,958
Here you have to remember that it is not always that simple.

174
00:12:02,983 --> 00:12:06,505
For example, if we come alone into a forest, it is not so safe -

175
00:12:06,530 --> 00:12:10,590
That we are fascinated by it.
 So in this context you have also had guides.

176
00:12:10,615 --> 00:12:13,201
So it's not people who have been completely alone.

177
00:12:13,241 --> 00:12:17,888
Which is also part of, the ability to recover.

178
00:12:17,913 --> 00:12:21,357
That you feel safe, in the environment where you are.

179
00:12:24,998 --> 00:12:27,646
Just.
 And then we come back a little to them here,

180
00:12:27,671 --> 00:12:31,474
What are the mechanisms behind the impact of this nature.

181
00:12:31,499 --> 00:12:35,404
Here we have written well -being, but health and well -being.

182
00:12:35,429 --> 00:12:40,341
Then we can back back and look a little, the natural environment and its condition.

183
00:12:40,366 --> 00:12:43,787
So size of it, where it is, what it looks like.

184
00:12:43,812 --> 00:12:48,695
It affects what nature contact we have.
 Of course, it has significance, -

185
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:53,217
How far do I have to go to get into this nature.

186
00:12:54,842 --> 00:12:59,529
This, in turn, affects how much time we stay in nature.

187
00:12:59,554 --> 00:13:03,224
So we have a proximity to nature, we stay more there.

188
00:13:03,345 --> 00:13:07,083
We also have the opportunity to carry out these activities, -

189
00:13:07,108 --> 00:13:11,005
As we said before.
 Physical activity, interaction with each other -

190
00:13:11,030 --> 00:13:12,233
and so on.

191
00:13:13,037 --> 00:13:16,755
In this picture you also see that you raise this with environmental exposure -

192
00:13:16,780 --> 00:13:21,357
for example.
 Obviously, we get fresh air, which Åsa was in before.

193
00:13:21,382 --> 00:13:26,880
We get vitamin D from being out.
 But we also get in this context -

194
00:13:26,905 --> 00:13:32,561
Maybe take part in environmental pollution, pollen and so on.

195
00:13:32,586 --> 00:13:36,522
So nothing is that, now we go out and then we get healthy.

196
00:13:36,547 --> 00:13:39,358
Without there are also pros and cons with these parts.

197
00:13:39,383 --> 00:13:44,107
That you think about it.
 However, we know it has -

198
00:13:44,132 --> 00:13:49,037
A stress -reducing effect.
 For example, if we stay in nature.

199
00:13:49,062 --> 00:13:52,279
Then it is so that it needs to be a certain time.

200
00:13:52,553 --> 00:13:55,177
There you can add that now during the pandemic, it has turned out -

201
00:13:55,202 --> 00:14:00,123
That we have been more outdoors, the Swedish population.

202
00:14:00,148 --> 00:14:03,259
But also many other countries, where we have gone outdoors.

203
00:14:05,534 --> 00:14:09,315
We have been aware that it promotes physical activity.

204
00:14:09,340 --> 00:14:14,079
And been to it with social contacts.
 But also another thing.

205
00:14:14,104 --> 00:14:19,432
It turns out that nature contact also increases our immune system.

206
00:14:19,457 --> 00:14:23,229
So there are many positive aspects in this, except for vitamin D.

207
00:14:23,254 --> 00:14:26,940
And it has to do with our nervous system.

208
00:14:26,965 --> 00:14:30,307
We have this stress cover with cortisol and so on.

209
00:14:30,332 --> 00:14:33,612
Or is it that we can dampen it.

210
00:14:33,916 --> 00:14:37,070
By staying in nature, in fact also so long -

211
00:14:37,095 --> 00:14:41,604
That we really take a deep breath and breathe in.

212
00:14:41,629 --> 00:14:47,198
And then sounds ours ... it gets like unconscious actions really.

213
00:14:47,223 --> 00:14:50,893
It is not something we can always influence, we can learn to handle it.

214
00:14:50,918 --> 00:14:55,940
And feel, we take a deep breath and land in the stay where we are.

215
00:14:56,330 --> 00:14:59,807
This is what you mean here, that these mechanisms lead to -

216
00:14:59,832 --> 00:15:03,446
health and well-being.
 Here we have just illustrated how you can ...

217
00:15:03,471 --> 00:15:06,354
[Åsa:] I was thinking of tab in, I think it's the Juuso family -

218
00:15:06,379 --> 00:15:09,158
Which is out on the kick here.
 [Päivi:] Yes, exactly.

219
00:15:09,183 --> 00:15:11,343
[Åsa:] Something I thought we could bring about this too, -

220
00:15:11,368 --> 00:15:13,650
when we talk about the impact of nature.

221
00:15:13,675 --> 00:15:19,665
It is the specific we have here.
 In the somewhat Arctic, in ours -

222
00:15:19,690 --> 00:15:23,072
northern parts and perhaps at all in Sweden as a country, -

223
00:15:23,097 --> 00:15:26,094
As such, also what it looks like.
 But perhaps not least -

224
00:15:26,119 --> 00:15:30,353
We up here.
 Where we have good conditions and you talk -

225
00:15:30,378 --> 00:15:33,845
Much about the green, clean and stuff.
 But we usually in our contexts -

226
00:15:33,870 --> 00:15:37,619
Talk about the white.
 So we have something very unique, with the snow -

227
00:15:37,644 --> 00:15:40,658
And the mountain world and that.
 [Päivi:] Absolutely, exactly.

228
00:15:40,683 --> 00:15:44,689
[Åsa:] At the same time some challenges with slip, darkness, cold.

229
00:15:44,868 --> 00:15:49,978
Which also affects opportunities to stay, for good and bad.

230
00:15:50,003 --> 00:15:52,744
[Päivi:] Yes, absolutely.
 We may all have noticed that too, -

231
00:15:52,769 --> 00:15:58,470
These changes in the climate.
 That we may have more ice, above all.

232
00:15:58,697 --> 00:16:01,994
I mostly just go with stitches, it may have to do with age, -

233
00:16:02,019 --> 00:16:05,697
Or it has to do with the weather.
 Unclear sometimes.

234
00:16:07,150 --> 00:16:10,431
Yes but then so.
 What do you say more.
 Is it something we can add.

235
00:16:10,456 --> 00:16:13,486
Like, if you don't have the access then?
 [Åsa:] This I think too -

236
00:16:13,511 --> 00:16:17,244
is an important aspect.
 That now we say it is useful to come out -

237
00:16:17,269 --> 00:16:22,868
In nature, has lots of advantages and so on.
 But, one should definitely not detract from, -

238
00:16:23,642 --> 00:16:27,095
On the contrary, it also makes it very good to just come out, -

239
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:31,955
For example, on the bridge.
 Able to sit outside on a balcony or patio.

240
00:16:32,383 --> 00:16:38,540
Just this proximity to nature.
 Also very favorable for health, -

241
00:16:38,930 --> 00:16:42,212
For example, being able to look in nature.

242
00:16:42,237 --> 00:16:46,470
Be able to see trees, out towards water, for example through a window.

243
00:16:48,674 --> 00:16:53,111
This picture to the right is from our sauna and I mean, -

244
00:16:53,136 --> 00:16:55,158
It is so much nicer to bathe sauna when you have -

245
00:16:55,183 --> 00:16:58,283
a window and can look out at the water.
 That's how it is.

246
00:16:58,308 --> 00:17:01,064
Then there is a lot of evidence for this too.

247
00:17:01,089 --> 00:17:04,048
There was one named Ulrich, who already in the 80s -

248
00:17:04,073 --> 00:17:11,001
Studied it that, when operated the gallbladder.

249
00:17:12,852 --> 00:17:17,275
He saw that those who had a view of nature, -

250
00:17:17,300 --> 00:17:20,634
Where there were trees and green areas and such.

251
00:17:21,103 --> 00:17:26,626
They were discharged faster from the hospital, they felt less ill and had less pain.

252
00:17:26,932 --> 00:17:31,158
This has been seen in different contexts, that there is, - -

253
00:17:31,183 --> 00:17:33,494
That it benefits to be in this.

254
00:17:33,519 --> 00:17:38,994
You see that, preschools located in very natural areas -

255
00:17:39,019 --> 00:17:42,384
And where there is the opportunity.
 So do they have the kids -

256
00:17:43,087 --> 00:17:47,861
Better concentration, also a calm after staying -

257
00:17:47,886 --> 00:17:51,298
And a creativity and stuff like that.
 And there are many examples -

258
00:17:51,323 --> 00:17:55,064
on feeling better in different contexts, -

259
00:17:55,089 --> 00:17:58,158
Right with the proximity to nature.

260
00:17:58,463 --> 00:18:03,572
It is also true that you can show that you feel better, are less worried -

261
00:18:03,597 --> 00:18:07,603
before an operation.
 Where, for example, you had a poster in the ceiling -

262
00:18:07,628 --> 00:18:13,123
with nature motifs.
 Versus that it is white or something else there.

263
00:18:14,673 --> 00:18:20,108
So we don't have to go out into the forest every time, but this is important to us.

264
00:18:20,584 --> 00:18:23,326
[Päivi:] There I can also add, you have to remember today -

265
00:18:23,351 --> 00:18:26,389
in the digitized world.
 That you work with a lot here too -

266
00:18:26,414 --> 00:18:31,287
To try to find other ways, to make nature available.

267
00:18:31,312 --> 00:18:34,373
For people who cannot get out at all.

268
00:18:34,398 --> 00:18:37,983
For example, if you are in a hospital or are at a retirement home -

269
00:18:38,008 --> 00:18:41,264
and does not have the physical ability to get out.

270
00:18:41,289 --> 00:18:45,397
And it is through AI and digital solutions.

271
00:18:46,029 --> 00:18:50,295
So it is the future that may show.
 [Åsa:] The future that may expel.

272
00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:53,920
[Päivi:] Yes, but exactly.
 And we have also had some studies.

273
00:18:53,945 --> 00:18:58,295
And now in conjunction with Covid -19, definitely a major impact on, -

274
00:18:58,320 --> 00:19:02,248
The whole world actually.
 Can you tell Åsa, a little about what we did there.

275
00:19:02,273 --> 00:19:06,873
[Åsa:] Yes.
 There we have done a lot of studies and interviewed -

276
00:19:06,898 --> 00:19:11,389
Both intensive care nurses, patients and relatives.

277
00:19:11,537 --> 00:19:15,649
In connection with intensive care of those affected by Covid-19.

278
00:19:17,066 --> 00:19:22,131
There is a lot around what they have experienced in different ways.

279
00:19:22,156 --> 00:19:26,710
But what was recurring in several of these descriptions was, -

280
00:19:26,735 --> 00:19:30,820
That was not the focus, but it was the importance of nature.

281
00:19:30,845 --> 00:19:33,162
In one way or another.

282
00:19:34,997 --> 00:19:40,006
This is how it could look inside a Covid-19 hall.

283
00:19:40,031 --> 00:19:42,688
Thus, where the patients were cared for.

284
00:19:42,904 --> 00:19:46,803
And for example, an intensive care nurse -

285
00:19:46,828 --> 00:19:51,155
described here.
 So it was just, you worked twelve and half hours.

286
00:19:51,180 --> 00:19:54,881
You were, trapped I was saying, more or less inside.

287
00:19:54,906 --> 00:19:57,702
You did not get out of the building.
 And how incredibly important, -

288
00:19:57,727 --> 00:20:00,384
You walked with the mask all day.

289
00:20:00,694 --> 00:20:03,532
How incredibly important it was, to take a walk out.

290
00:20:03,557 --> 00:20:07,983
And could spend the night at IVA, because you would soon be on the next pass again.

291
00:20:08,008 --> 00:20:12,647
And you know here in Norrbotten, you were in Piteå.
 It was some who commuted there.

292
00:20:12,672 --> 00:20:16,006
Worked twelve and a half hours and was going up again in the morning.

293
00:20:16,031 --> 00:20:20,108
This is exactly what to get out, get some air and see the other world.

294
00:20:20,133 --> 00:20:22,944
Was incredibly, incredibly important.

295
00:20:22,969 --> 00:20:26,100
Just like what you were in, we have had an increased interest -

296
00:20:26,125 --> 00:20:30,649
Overall, to get to the mountains, to be out.

297
00:20:31,157 --> 00:20:36,084
It has also been the prerequisite we had, that sometimes be able to meet and such.

298
00:20:36,109 --> 00:20:41,997
The relatives who were at home and worried about the person who was seriously ill.

299
00:20:42,022 --> 00:20:47,232
Also described the importance of coming out, taking a walk, getting fresh air.

300
00:20:47,829 --> 00:20:50,786
Someone described, who was not so interested in giant, -

301
00:20:50,811 --> 00:20:53,804
But she said, I went up and down the mountain several times a day.

302
00:20:53,829 --> 00:20:56,802
Just because I would be tired in the evening and be able to sleep.

303
00:20:56,827 --> 00:21:00,716
So it is absolutely important.
 In different ways.

304
00:21:00,741 --> 00:21:03,837
Even then when you got home, it has also had, both for -

305
00:21:03,862 --> 00:21:07,798
the relatives and the patient.
 Being able to stay in this.

306
00:21:09,004 --> 00:21:13,731
I interviewed a woman, when I would ask about what it was -

307
00:21:13,756 --> 00:21:16,263
Having been seriously ill in Covid-19.

308
00:21:17,082 --> 00:21:21,599
She told us, among other things, that, -

309
00:21:21,624 --> 00:21:26,023
Yes it was very busy and you felt alone.
 She had her family -

310
00:21:26,048 --> 00:21:29,693
Very far away.
 She had been transported helicopter this way.

311
00:21:29,718 --> 00:21:33,419
And, as I said, they were not allowed to be there.
 So she was there herself.

312
00:21:33,444 --> 00:21:36,599
Then she told me that, yes it may sound a bit strange, -

313
00:21:36,624 --> 00:21:41,521
But I had a friend.
 And it was a pine outside my window.

314
00:21:42,006 --> 00:21:46,179
Well, I thought this was interesting.
 She told me that -

315
00:21:46,204 --> 00:21:51,654
This number, it said what the weather and wind was.

316
00:21:51,679 --> 00:21:54,271
If it had snowed and so on.

317
00:21:55,669 --> 00:22:00,958
In the evening I said good night to it and in the morning when I woke up, -

318
00:22:00,983 --> 00:22:03,536
So it stood there waiting for me.

319
00:22:05,076 --> 00:22:09,310
Some night they had pulled down the blinds and the blinds -

320
00:22:09,335 --> 00:22:13,997
And she almost panicked when she couldn't look out the window.

321
00:22:14,990 --> 00:22:19,193
She also described it just like this that, yes probably the staff was kind -

322
00:22:19,218 --> 00:22:24,388
And they came in and so on.
 But I was very lonely and then I had my pine.

323
00:22:25,524 --> 00:22:30,677
And somehow she described it as, it was me and the numbers to the world.

324
00:22:30,702 --> 00:22:35,837
I was in continued contact with the woman and still keep in touch.

325
00:22:37,567 --> 00:22:40,677
Then we decided to write an article, I asked if it was okay -

326
00:22:40,702 --> 00:22:43,294
Have had contact, about this number.

327
00:22:43,560 --> 00:22:48,060
And there are a lot of theories about this with that -

328
00:22:48,085 --> 00:22:52,130
Animals, which I have been on.
 And even nature, can be important.

329
00:22:52,155 --> 00:22:56,865
And that it can be, the other need not be a human being.

330
00:22:56,890 --> 00:23:00,497
There is something big in this.

331
00:23:00,883 --> 00:23:03,411
When I usually tell you about this, there are others who come and tell you, -

332
00:23:03,436 --> 00:23:08,376
Yes you know when I was lying, then there was a bird's nest outside and a little so.

333
00:23:09,224 --> 00:23:12,419
So it's of incredible importance.

334
00:23:12,444 --> 00:23:16,356
And even in this we discuss against Ulrich and Boberg -

335
00:23:16,381 --> 00:23:20,404
And this with humanity, Dahlberg and so on.

336
00:23:21,446 --> 00:23:24,349
What she tells this woman, so it was, she lived as I said-

337
00:23:24,374 --> 00:23:27,341
far from here.
 I would think it's 30, 40 miles or something.

338
00:23:27,366 --> 00:23:31,411
She said, sometimes I want to go and visit the numbers.

339
00:23:31,436 --> 00:23:35,759
Because it was so important and the one that made me move on.

340
00:23:37,091 --> 00:23:40,788
After a while I got a message and then she had sent -

341
00:23:40,813 --> 00:23:44,337
this picture.
 I have been allowed to show it.

342
00:23:45,173 --> 00:23:51,786
When she is and visits her pine, outside the hospital in Piteå.

343
00:23:52,388 --> 00:23:55,855
She hugs it.
 So she has said, you must never cut down that.

344
00:23:55,880 --> 00:23:58,810
It was her power through this time.

345
00:24:00,248 --> 00:24:02,990
Think it is important.
 And I have some of that article if you want -

346
00:24:03,015 --> 00:24:05,552
Bring with you.
 It's a short article, there are some there and there are -

347
00:24:05,577 --> 00:24:08,657
Something for a copy if you would like to read.

348
00:24:09,122 --> 00:24:14,294
This is just a quote to draw.
 From one of the nurses -

349
00:24:14,319 --> 00:24:19,055
Who worked very intensively, at this Covid-19 IVA department.

350
00:24:19,248 --> 00:24:24,571
And as was sick eventually.
 Because it was simply too much.

351
00:24:24,834 --> 00:24:29,029
She also described this meaning of being in nature -

352
00:24:29,054 --> 00:24:33,044
And what it did to her.
 This description it is, -

353
00:24:33,069 --> 00:24:35,896
Could be almost in any context.

354
00:24:35,921 --> 00:24:39,888
This with stress -related ill health.
 As we are in in many and many -

355
00:24:39,913 --> 00:24:42,560
And what it can do.
 I read it.

356
00:24:43,458 --> 00:24:47,466
[Reads the quote on the screen]

357
00:25:35,918 --> 00:25:40,512
[Päivi:] mm, exactly.
 And here we get into the climate, suddenly.

358
00:25:40,537 --> 00:25:43,223
I think, I can feedback to this previous one.

359
00:25:43,248 --> 00:25:48,707
That we will come into the parts that also feedback to them.

360
00:25:49,052 --> 00:25:53,090
But now we have to talk about the climate.
 [Åsa:] Yes, now we have to talk about the climate.

361
00:25:53,115 --> 00:25:55,721
[Päivi:] And what do we say about the climate and its importance.

362
00:25:55,746 --> 00:26:00,379
[Åsa:] Yes, but we say that the climate is important for health.

363
00:26:01,137 --> 00:26:06,566
What we know here and now, we know that we have a higher average temperature -

364
00:26:06,598 --> 00:26:11,395
than we've ever had.
 We know that it brings, -

365
00:26:12,614 --> 00:26:16,871
Storms in different ways.
 Floods and such.

366
00:26:17,120 --> 00:26:21,238
This means risks that water will be contaminated.

367
00:26:21,263 --> 00:26:25,418
This means that, for example, we get ticks up here.

368
00:26:25,443 --> 00:26:29,316
These are diseases that may become relevant in a different way.

369
00:26:30,395 --> 00:26:35,770
It affects us in a variety of ways.
 And what one can say is that -

370
00:26:36,034 --> 00:26:40,449
None of this as it brings, is good for health either.

371
00:26:40,474 --> 00:26:43,879
[Päivi:] mm, exactly.
 And of course, in this context it is, -

372
00:26:43,904 --> 00:26:48,707
And we also know that, it is the weakest that are most affected.

373
00:26:48,996 --> 00:26:52,387
And it is related if you look at a global perspective.

374
00:26:52,412 --> 00:26:55,120
But you look from an Arctic perspective.
 Don't we get either -

375
00:26:55,145 --> 00:26:59,644
forget about the importance the climate we have in the Arctic, -

376
00:26:59,669 --> 00:27:03,879
have in a larger context.
 One thinks that, when our ice creams -

377
00:27:03,904 --> 00:27:08,496
Starting to melt, what does it mean.
 Also for this heating.

378
00:27:08,521 --> 00:27:14,199
Here, but also elsewhere.
 In addition, it is also the case that, -

379
00:27:14,559 --> 00:27:19,621
This means a lot in living conditions and living habits.

380
00:27:19,646 --> 00:27:23,801
Can we continue with our traditional way of life and living habits.

381
00:27:23,826 --> 00:27:28,973
Given that the climate affects so much, so that -

382
00:27:29,395 --> 00:27:34,293
the temperature rises, the ice melts, water levels rise, -

383
00:27:34,318 --> 00:27:37,309
The tree line creeps higher up in the mountains.

384
00:27:37,334 --> 00:27:40,793
All of this, overall, has a significance for flora and fauna.

385
00:27:40,818 --> 00:27:47,450
So the animals and plants we have, have a meaning for -

386
00:27:48,301 --> 00:27:53,301
Our effect and being here.
 But also on the basis of traditional -

387
00:27:53,645 --> 00:27:58,676
Life pattern.
 Then we would like to be that it is, for example, -

388
00:27:58,871 --> 00:28:03,457
for the reindeer herding Sami.
 This is also seen in other parts of the Arctic.

389
00:28:03,489 --> 00:28:09,637
Where it is more difficult for people who live according to the traditional way of life.

390
00:28:09,669 --> 00:28:12,777
And maybe have your own animals or need to have, if you think about -

391
00:28:12,802 --> 00:28:15,504
The indigenous perspective.

392
00:28:16,012 --> 00:28:20,848
So this is absolutely relevant, for all of us.
 To really take responsibility.

393
00:28:20,873 --> 00:28:24,980
And what responsibility I can take.
 Because sometimes we can throw back the question.

394
00:28:25,005 --> 00:28:29,824
So that, yes but, what can I do.
 The little I do.

395
00:28:29,849 --> 00:28:34,660
But the little one of us does, is important in this context.

396
00:28:34,685 --> 00:28:39,183
When talking about the climate, it is so that there is a meaning.

397
00:28:39,208 --> 00:28:43,300
There is also a reasoning about, and even a letter -

398
00:28:43,325 --> 00:28:48,105
About this with, how to build sustainable cities.

399
00:28:48,130 --> 00:28:51,074
It is very relevant in Norrbotten.

400
00:28:51,254 --> 00:28:54,512
How to have a sustainable urban environment planning.

401
00:28:54,762 --> 00:28:58,676
To be able to maintain and perhaps reduce transport -

402
00:28:58,701 --> 00:29:01,066
which is also daily transport.

403
00:29:01,706 --> 00:29:06,855
So it has one, what we do definitely has a meaning.

404
00:29:06,880 --> 00:29:10,285
We are also those who may actually do something.

405
00:29:10,310 --> 00:29:13,137
For that, we must remember, those that are the weakest in society -

406
00:29:13,162 --> 00:29:17,957
They do not have the same resources as we do.
 To make active choices.

407
00:29:18,965 --> 00:29:22,684
[Åsa:] What one can really summarize this that, -

408
00:29:22,709 --> 00:29:26,762
Good living habits can mean great gains for both climate and health.

409
00:29:26,787 --> 00:29:30,426
So, how we live, really goes hand in hand, -

410
00:29:30,451 --> 00:29:33,551
by doing something about the climate.

411
00:29:33,584 --> 00:29:37,754
So, we would eat better, maybe reduce meat.

412
00:29:38,449 --> 00:29:43,168
Should we move more to a greater extent, it is good for us, -

413
00:29:43,193 --> 00:29:47,652
But also good for the environment.
 Thus, physically.

414
00:29:47,677 --> 00:29:50,691
[Päivi:] The active choices.
 And of course we can't either -

415
00:29:50,716 --> 00:29:55,137
Knit under chair with, maybe our living habits, -

416
00:29:56,098 --> 00:29:59,090
If they looked different.
 Had we not been in that situation -

417
00:29:59,115 --> 00:30:02,168
We have been now, these two and a half last years.

418
00:30:02,193 --> 00:30:05,145
And this is probably not something, where it stops.

419
00:30:05,170 --> 00:30:09,035
So it's hard to say, whose is the fault and where does it come from.

420
00:30:09,060 --> 00:30:13,574
But I think, instead of accusing.
 I think we have to take -

421
00:30:13,599 --> 00:30:15,317
to make active choices.

422
00:30:15,878 --> 00:30:19,316
It does not mean that you completely end up with everything.

423
00:30:20,465 --> 00:30:23,910
Without, you have to think a little.
 Here we can also lift, -

424
00:30:23,935 --> 00:30:28,183
That there is also research in, how can you make care more sustainable -

425
00:30:28,208 --> 00:30:33,121
And more climate -friendly.
 Actually on the basis that it is consumed -

426
00:30:33,146 --> 00:30:37,730
A lot of material and what can we do there.
 It is not something that is brand new.

427
00:30:37,755 --> 00:30:40,730
Because it was actually even when I read to the nurse.

428
00:30:40,755 --> 00:30:45,020
But now you have pinpoint it and show the importance of, -

429
00:30:45,045 --> 00:30:48,598
To make these active choices even in these organizations.

430
00:30:48,623 --> 00:30:54,674
How can we maintain a high patient safety, but still not then, -

431
00:30:54,699 --> 00:30:58,254
Actually wasting, on resources.

432
00:30:58,997 --> 00:31:02,371
[Åsa:] Good.
 I think we move on.
 [Päivi:] Yes.

433
00:31:03,824 --> 00:31:08,042
[Åsa:] Yes, then we have another question here, which we talked about in the introduction.

434
00:31:08,340 --> 00:31:11,934
This with, can really care, care and rehabilitation -

435
00:31:11,959 --> 00:31:14,473
be implemented outdoors?
 [Päivi:] mm.

436
00:31:14,895 --> 00:31:19,879
This is an incredibly interesting question we asked.
 Given that, -

437
00:31:19,904 --> 00:31:25,246
If we now think that there is evidence that nature and animals -

438
00:31:25,271 --> 00:31:28,340
has a significance for our health and well -being.

439
00:31:28,365 --> 00:31:33,020
Is it also that, we asked ourselves the question, but why is implemented then -

440
00:31:33,045 --> 00:31:37,762
All care, care and rehabilitation mainly indoors.

441
00:31:38,972 --> 00:31:43,899
We did this together, you see down here, we are four editors in a book.

442
00:31:43,924 --> 00:31:48,105
Which is written, thanks to very great help from others.

443
00:31:48,130 --> 00:31:53,223
And where we aim to describe and fill in -

444
00:31:53,248 --> 00:31:57,840
These knowledge gaps available.
 Related to these aspects.

445
00:31:57,865 --> 00:32:01,098
Can we conduct care, care, rehabilitation outdoors.

446
00:32:01,123 --> 00:32:05,293
And how can we increase knowledge about how it can be done.

447
00:32:06,739 --> 00:32:11,512
With that also enable and make available, precisely nature -

448
00:32:11,537 --> 00:32:15,988
And its health promotion effects, to patients.
 Or persons -

449
00:32:16,013 --> 00:32:19,793
that cannot go out.
 We have been to it before.

450
00:32:19,818 --> 00:32:22,801
If you think practical examples, can be for example, -

451
00:32:22,826 --> 00:32:28,137
That we are usually rehabilitated back after a stroke.

452
00:32:29,153 --> 00:32:33,128
Then we go indoors on flat floors.
 While you can ask for -

453
00:32:33,153 --> 00:32:36,832
Those parts could be done outdoors anyway.

454
00:32:36,857 --> 00:32:42,284
That one had had, care, care and rehabilitation context, -

455
00:32:42,309 --> 00:32:46,176
Thus, the care business near nature, constructed.

456
00:32:46,566 --> 00:32:49,645
We can also see it sometimes in hospitals that it is built.

457
00:32:49,678 --> 00:32:54,933
But some hospitals we can see, where it has grown again, it has not been used.

458
00:32:54,958 --> 00:32:58,824
But in this book we lift these parts.
 But also describes a little -

459
00:32:58,849 --> 00:33:02,629
About the theories we have described before here during this lecture.

460
00:33:02,654 --> 00:33:08,355
And take off from there.
 To show, what can we do.

461
00:33:08,380 --> 00:33:13,074
So it becomes a bit like a guide for how to implement -

462
00:33:13,099 --> 00:33:16,020
This, in its business.

463
00:33:16,512 --> 00:33:19,676
But is actually aimed at, we must remember that, -

464
00:33:19,701 --> 00:33:24,996
Actually to the general public that is curious.
 But we also think, to students.

465
00:33:25,021 --> 00:33:30,043
And all, really organizations.
 [Åsa:] We can say that too, -

466
00:33:30,068 --> 00:33:33,590
It is not then that everything should be outdoors.

467
00:33:33,615 --> 00:33:35,262
[Päivi:] No.
 [Åsa:] Without it is the proximity.

468
00:33:35,287 --> 00:33:40,355
What we have been in before, to be able to look.
 Natural and for example, -

469
00:33:40,380 --> 00:33:43,504
Access to garden and things like that.
 [Päivi:] Yes, exactly.

470
00:33:43,529 --> 00:33:46,770
Exactly, because you can also ask, all calls need to be done -

471
00:33:46,795 --> 00:33:50,863
in a closed small room.
 If we think I'm in need of conversation.

472
00:33:50,888 --> 00:33:56,480
Can we actually make the calls outdoors or during a walk.

473
00:33:56,505 --> 00:34:00,715
Prevention factors can be sound and so on.
 But think you can -

474
00:34:00,740 --> 00:34:04,535
Look on the basis of the patient's or person, or the user.

475
00:34:04,560 --> 00:34:08,418
As the elderly are usually called, their needs and conditions.

476
00:34:08,443 --> 00:34:14,223
Maybe being able to move outdoors.
 Related to sound and weather, of course -

477
00:34:14,248 --> 00:34:17,543
We must think.
 But here we would like to, -

478
00:34:18,223 --> 00:34:21,527
We actually want to flag for this book, it will have release this fall.

479
00:34:21,552 --> 00:34:24,387
It is in collaboration with student literature.

480
00:34:24,412 --> 00:34:28,129
So there are two physiotherapists, Liljegren and Lundgren.

481
00:34:28,154 --> 00:34:31,074
And then we are two nurses, who have written this.

482
00:34:31,099 --> 00:34:33,588
With the help of all them here.
 Now I don't even remember -

483
00:34:33,613 --> 00:34:35,738
How many they are.
 Many authors.

484
00:34:35,997 --> 00:34:40,965
[Åsa:] To the right we see, June, only to be called June and Stand -

485
00:34:40,990 --> 00:34:44,887
for the health care of the future.
 Maybe then outdoors.

486
00:34:45,278 --> 00:34:49,198
If you are wondering what she has for the title of that, then it is coordinator.

487
00:34:49,223 --> 00:34:53,824
I think that is also something for the future.
 To get ours together, -

488
00:34:53,849 --> 00:34:58,395
Both professions and so on.
 So yes.
 [Päivi:] mm, exactly.

489
00:34:59,488 --> 00:35:02,285
You had an example here, it has been just recently.

490
00:35:02,310 --> 00:35:04,840
I don't know if you have others, but Åsa may tell you a little.

491
00:35:04,865 --> 00:35:09,137
[Åsa:] Yes.
 This one was just recently in, <i> Dagens Medicine. </i>

492
00:35:09,162 --> 00:35:12,402
This is also something we discussed and noted, -

493
00:35:12,427 --> 00:35:15,887
Even when we have written this book.

494
00:35:17,348 --> 00:35:22,520
Anna and Helle, as visible in the picture here on the left.
 Have also  -

495
00:35:22,545 --> 00:35:25,418
contributed to the book and writing in it.

496
00:35:25,722 --> 00:35:28,988
What they have raised is a debate article in, Dagens Medicin.

497
00:35:29,013 --> 00:35:32,957
It is about giving patients the same right as inmates.

498
00:35:34,105 --> 00:35:38,949
It is so that, it is actually enrolled -

499
00:35:39,443 --> 00:35:45,449
in law.
 That as internal in prison -

500
00:35:45,474 --> 00:35:49,215
So you are entitled to outdoor living, daily outdoor living.

501
00:35:49,240 --> 00:35:54,066
You do not have as a patient, user or accommodation, -

502
00:35:55,801 --> 00:36:00,598
in care, care and rehabilitation in general.

503
00:36:00,989 --> 00:36:05,293
That's really what the article is about.
 To notice -

504
00:36:05,318 --> 00:36:08,855
To have these opportunities, actually.

505
00:36:10,035 --> 00:36:13,495
What they propose as a recommendation.

506
00:36:13,520 --> 00:36:17,480
Is that principals and decision makers in healthcare and care.

507
00:36:17,505 --> 00:36:22,081
Takes care of the knowledge that exists, about health -promoting outdoor environments -

508
00:36:22,106 --> 00:36:24,488
potential in care context.

509
00:36:25,028 --> 00:36:29,121
That we have a holistic perspective, which is taken into account in the construction of -

510
00:36:29,146 --> 00:36:33,865
Hospitals and healthcare institutions.
 And that both inside and outdoor environments -

511
00:36:33,890 --> 00:36:36,403
Available in planning from the start.

512
00:36:37,497 --> 00:36:40,504
Finally ... [Reads Text 3]

513
00:36:52,771 --> 00:36:58,771
Then we will talk a little about a project.
 As we had together -

514
00:36:58,796 --> 00:37:03,435
And as you have been driving from the Swedish side.
 Called, Nordic Nabs.

515
00:37:03,460 --> 00:37:06,341
What is that?
 [Päivi:] Exactly.

516
00:37:06,366 --> 00:37:11,325
Now it is 2019 in January, which we received funds from Interreg Nord.

517
00:37:11,350 --> 00:37:13,794
Thus, it is EU-funded funds.

518
00:37:13,819 --> 00:37:17,654
To implement projects where we actually investigate this.

519
00:37:17,679 --> 00:37:21,154
How do we take were on nature's values.

520
00:37:21,179 --> 00:37:25,438
This is a project that has been implemented and we are in the last month.

521
00:37:25,463 --> 00:37:30,005
In collaboration with SMEs, here in Norrbotten -

522
00:37:30,030 --> 00:37:35,607
And Västerbotten.
 On the Swedish side.
 Then we also have three regions in Finland.

523
00:37:35,632 --> 00:37:40,771
Where they also collaborated with small and medium -sized entrepreneurs there.

524
00:37:40,796 --> 00:37:45,724
And then there are public actors.
 Here, among other things, the Region Norrbotten - has

525
00:37:45,749 --> 00:37:48,677
Also been co -financed and co -actor.

526
00:37:51,333 --> 00:37:54,115
During this project, of course we have also looked at, -

527
00:37:54,140 --> 00:37:59,755
How could one use the natural resource industry -

528
00:37:59,780 --> 00:38:02,638
Competence and knowledge, as a complement.

529
00:38:02,663 --> 00:38:06,052
Because as we mentioned earlier, it is not that everyone should just go out.

530
00:38:06,077 --> 00:38:09,232
Now everyone is going out, we all solve the world's problems with it.

531
00:38:09,257 --> 00:38:12,911
Without, how should we make sure the resources are enough.

532
00:38:13,287 --> 00:38:16,356
If you think based on what health care looks like today.

533
00:38:16,381 --> 00:38:20,543
What is it that are recovery measures, rehabilitative action -

534
00:38:20,568 --> 00:38:24,677
and so on.
 Here we have looked at a little, just those parts.

535
00:38:24,702 --> 00:38:28,763
How can these small, medium -sized companies that have businesses -

536
00:38:28,788 --> 00:38:33,357
in the natural resource industry.
 As too, some of them are -

537
00:38:33,382 --> 00:38:37,482
Trained healthcare professionals, others not, as it looks here.

538
00:38:37,507 --> 00:38:42,224
But like the rehabilitation garden in Alnarp.

539
00:38:42,249 --> 00:38:47,075
These could promote health among customers, clients.

540
00:38:48,747 --> 00:38:53,816
In our projects, customers, clients have come from various public actors.

541
00:38:53,841 --> 00:38:57,497
During projects, of course, on a voluntary basis.

542
00:38:57,522 --> 00:39:02,519
But we also have this.
 Really had follow -up research.

543
00:39:02,544 --> 00:39:04,185
We have a doctoral student, -

544
00:39:04,592 --> 00:39:10,700
who consolidates the area and studying, what do we get for -

545
00:39:11,013 --> 00:39:14,497
Contribution to the research base on this.

546
00:39:14,522 --> 00:39:19,404
What is it like to be a person who gets to test them here, in the northern environment.

547
00:39:19,429 --> 00:39:23,099
If you think, we still have a large part of the year winter.

548
00:39:23,124 --> 00:39:27,490
And how could one imagine that these so -called -

549
00:39:27,515 --> 00:39:32,943
The green areas do not work in a white context.

550
00:39:32,968 --> 00:39:37,873
As in this picture.
 It is actually our loggo image.

551
00:39:39,068 --> 00:39:43,575
I also want to, under this picture flag because we have -

552
00:39:43,600 --> 00:39:47,091
a website.
 Which will be open until 2024.

553
00:39:47,116 --> 00:39:50,677
There you will find links to Youtube and so on.

554
00:39:50,702 --> 00:39:55,388
Various lectures that exist in Finnish, Swedish and English.

555
00:39:55,607 --> 00:39:59,146
[Åsa:] There is also a Facebook group.
 [Päivi:] There is a Facebook group.

556
00:39:59,171 --> 00:40:04,770
Until the end of the year, where you can go in.

557
00:40:06,528 --> 00:40:08,911
It goes under the long name,

558
00:40:08,936 --> 00:40:11,825
New Nordic Nature Based Service Models.

559
00:40:11,850 --> 00:40:14,599
It's a very long name, so we got to find a short name.

560
00:40:14,624 --> 00:40:18,779
So we don't slip with the tongue every time at talking about this.

561
00:40:18,804 --> 00:40:22,341
But here I can also say that it is Vasa University.

562
00:40:22,366 --> 00:40:27,490
It is Lapland's vocational college and Oulu vocational college, -

563
00:40:27,515 --> 00:40:31,177
Who has been with us in this.

564
00:40:32,036 --> 00:40:34,325
Except we from LTU.
 [Åsa:] I don't know who -

565
00:40:34,350 --> 00:40:36,013
Knocks on here.
 [Päivi:] No, I've also listened.

566
00:40:36,038 --> 00:40:37,798
What is it that knocks?
 (someone knocks on the door)

567
00:40:37,798 --> 00:40:39,153
null

568
00:40:39,178 --> 00:40:41,208
[Åsa:] Yeah.
 [Päivi:] Yes, yes.

569
00:40:41,646 --> 00:40:44,591
[Åsa:] Yes.
 It is good.
 [Päivi:] No, it's quiet.

570
00:40:44,616 --> 00:40:48,411
I actually started to think, what if someone locked in to the toilet.

571
00:40:48,436 --> 00:40:50,833
[Åsa laughs] [päivi:] my practical thought only, -

572
00:40:50,858 --> 00:40:53,779
Now we have to go and help someone sitting there.
 And we all just sit here -

573
00:40:53,804 --> 00:40:55,458
And do nothing.
 [Åsa:] Yes, it thought.

574
00:40:55,483 --> 00:40:57,536
[Päivi:] But good, then we know it.

575
00:40:57,561 --> 00:41:00,630
Yes exactly.
 And during the project we have done such pilots, -

576
00:41:00,655 --> 00:41:06,107
As we call it.
 Actually test attempts, with these contractors.

577
00:41:06,132 --> 00:41:09,638
Where people on a voluntary basis, from the public actors -

578
00:41:09,663 --> 00:41:13,200
has been able to carry out nature -based activities.

579
00:41:14,146 --> 00:41:17,599
It is very interesting to see, how have they experienced this.

580
00:41:17,624 --> 00:41:21,435
Here I have only put in three very short, quotes really.

581
00:41:21,460 --> 00:41:25,364
About the experience of these stays.
 Then it is that you have -

582
00:41:25,389 --> 00:41:29,825
Got to be on five occasions, three hours per occasion.

583
00:41:30,060 --> 00:41:35,872
So there are no long processes.
 Then you can also understand when you say, -

584
00:41:37,698 --> 00:41:40,708
[Reads second quote screen]

585
00:41:43,060 --> 00:41:48,919
Here there have been slightly different client groups that have participated in -

586
00:41:48,944 --> 00:41:51,435
These activities.

587
00:41:51,974 --> 00:41:55,107
And one person says, "I've felt safe."
 Then we will come back -

588
00:41:55,132 --> 00:41:58,724
To that feeling of security.
 And also appreciated.

589
00:41:59,584 --> 00:42:02,950
Which is so incredibly important to our self -esteem.
 “I feel safer -

590
00:42:02,975 --> 00:42:06,529
Before starting work training.
 For I have seen here that there is the opportunity -

591
00:42:06,554 --> 00:42:07,872
that it can be good. "

592
00:42:09,560 --> 00:42:15,115
It is also part of this context that one is strengthened in one's self -confidence, -

593
00:42:15,140 --> 00:42:17,036
But also his self -esteem.

594
00:42:17,910 --> 00:42:22,442
To be in nature and take in with different senses, to still the senses -

595
00:42:22,467 --> 00:42:26,904
in everyday life.
 Is a great help in dealing with life and one's stress.

596
00:42:26,929 --> 00:42:30,185
Then we have to remember that, under these pilots.
 Have you not been -

597
00:42:30,210 --> 00:42:35,646
alone with the animals.
 All the farms have had animals, -

598
00:42:36,045 --> 00:42:38,990
Where we had a pilot ... no not really everyone.
 There has been some garden -

599
00:42:39,015 --> 00:42:42,411
And some animals.
 But there have been several who had horses, among other things.

600
00:42:42,436 --> 00:42:44,294
As in the picture here.

601
00:42:45,193 --> 00:42:47,841
But remembering that, it is with the help of a guide.

602
00:42:47,866 --> 00:42:51,177
So it's not that you are driven to a farm, so you have to manage yourself.

603
00:42:51,202 --> 00:42:55,825
Without having a support there.
 Which is really very important -

604
00:42:55,850 --> 00:42:57,575
in this context.

605
00:42:59,873 --> 00:43:03,552
And with that we want to, now it is in English this text.

606
00:43:03,577 --> 00:43:09,107
Based on Bengtsson and Grahn.
 Who has looked at, this is a theory.

607
00:43:09,132 --> 00:43:13,646
If ... it's called Set in English.

608
00:43:14,650 --> 00:43:18,991
It is really the one, the environmental theory of supportive environments, -

609
00:43:19,024 --> 00:43:21,811
Can you say it is in Swedish.

610
00:43:21,836 --> 00:43:28,311
If you think of the box at the bottom.
 There is really when the person feels the worst.

611
00:43:28,703 --> 00:43:31,835
I think that is very interesting really based on this theory.

612
00:43:31,860 --> 00:43:35,577
Because here you show that, you are quite inward.

613
00:43:35,602 --> 00:43:40,679
You can't cope with contact with others.
 I have met people who have -

614
00:43:41,366 --> 00:43:45,882
Been sick for stress -related ill health, who says that, no but we ...

615
00:43:45,907 --> 00:43:48,749
... they could nothing, they couldn't even be with animals.

616
00:43:48,774 --> 00:43:53,585
Without it just being in yourself.
 That it starts there.

617
00:43:54,233 --> 00:43:58,428
Then it will be more emotionally engaged.

618
00:43:58,453 --> 00:44:02,827
To eventually become active and also outgoing.

619
00:44:04,428 --> 00:44:08,194
I now see that it is, one minute we have left.

620
00:44:08,219 --> 00:44:11,663
So I think I don't stay here.
 Yes, it is interesting this.

621
00:44:11,688 --> 00:44:16,022
We will see then if any questions are related to that part.

622
00:44:16,047 --> 00:44:17,608
[Åsa:] Should I browse?
 [Päivi:] Yes, I think so.

623
00:44:17,633 --> 00:44:21,233
Because I see that time goes by.
 We also want to flag a little because there is -

624
00:44:21,258 --> 00:44:25,108
Publications in selection, in this project.
 And that it comes -

625
00:44:25,133 --> 00:44:30,436
A final report, natural values as a source of well -being.

626
00:44:30,461 --> 00:44:33,390
It will be in Swedish and Finnish.

627
00:44:33,415 --> 00:44:37,100
So it will come soon, during the month of April.

628
00:44:37,125 --> 00:44:42,015
Then it is like a PDF, to download or print.
 How to do.

629
00:44:42,040 --> 00:44:46,718
There are additional publications, also related to indeed, -

630
00:44:46,898 --> 00:44:53,194
This form of activities and business models.
 Like a social innovation.

631
00:44:53,219 --> 00:44:55,202
But we can't delve into it.
 [Åsa:] No.

632
00:44:55,227 --> 00:44:56,937
[Päivi:] We continue.

633
00:44:58,760 --> 00:45:01,807
[Åsa:] Yes.
 But if we were to sum it all up.

634
00:45:01,832 --> 00:45:04,455
Then we take the questions here again.
 [Päivi:] mm.

635
00:45:04,480 --> 00:45:07,260
[Åsa:] that with animals and nature has a positive impact -

636
00:45:07,285 --> 00:45:10,471
on human health.
 Would you say that is true?

637
00:45:10,496 --> 00:45:14,166
[Päivi:] Yes, absolutely, that's right.
 Let's see if I answered ... yes that is true.

638
00:45:14,191 --> 00:45:16,432
[Both small laughs] It's always exciting when one -

639
00:45:16,457 --> 00:45:19,627
Complete before and ... [Åsa:] if they end up right.

640
00:45:19,652 --> 00:45:20,854
[Päivi:] Yes, exactly.
 [Åsa:] it has any meaning -

641
00:45:20,879 --> 00:45:25,135
which nature we stay in. Is it better to be in forest or near water -

642
00:45:25,160 --> 00:45:28,588
Or does it work in a park?
 [Päivi:] It works in a park.

643
00:45:28,613 --> 00:45:31,791
So the important thing is that we get out.

644
00:45:31,918 --> 00:45:35,736
So it has some significance what it is for the environment.
 But, -

645
00:45:35,761 --> 00:45:40,096
Don't forget the park's values.
 Because that's what we often have urban.

646
00:45:40,121 --> 00:45:42,752
[Åsa:] This with the importance of climate for health then?

647
00:45:42,777 --> 00:45:47,291
[Päivi:] Yes, exactly.
 Absolutely, the climate is important for health.

648
00:45:47,526 --> 00:45:51,041
[Åsa:] and, this with care, care, rehabilitation outdoors.

649
00:45:51,066 --> 00:45:54,799
Is it really possible to implement?
 [Päivi:] Yes.
 We flag it.

650
00:45:54,824 --> 00:45:57,846
And that it becomes a complement to traditional care.

651
00:45:57,871 --> 00:46:01,502
So we can have these parts, as part of it.

652
00:46:02,706 --> 00:46:03,619
[Åsa:] Good.
 [Päivi:] Yes.

653
00:46:03,644 --> 00:46:06,381
[Åsa:] Thanks for listening.
 [Päivi:] Thanks so much.

654
00:46:06,406 --> 00:46:08,992
