1
00:00:11,234 --> 00:00:16,200
- So now we roll the most powerful intro we have ever had on this channel!

2
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:46,600
We will do this as a top list.

3
00:00:46,600 --> 00:00:48,400
And we start with number 7.

4
00:00:48,400 --> 00:00:52,400
In this, this section is that, incidentally, in paid cooperation with Revolut.

5
00:00:52,400 --> 00:00:55,400
And now it will be about one of the world's most iconic voices.

6
00:00:55,400 --> 00:00:56,800
You've all heard it.

7
00:00:56,800 --> 00:01:01,160
We will meet the official Swedish Kalle Duck voice.

8
00:01:01,640 --> 00:01:05,160
There are probably few votes that are as iconic as this one.

9
00:01:05,320 --> 00:01:09,960
And since 1987 it has been made by the same man, Andreas Nilsson.

10
00:01:10,120 --> 00:01:15,440
Now for the first time we will see the face behind Swedish Kalle Duck.

11
00:01:16,480 --> 00:01:18,480
Hello!
 Hey!

12
00:01:25,843 --> 00:01:28,438
- Hey how are you?
 Hahaha

13
00:01:28,438 --> 00:01:30,220
Yeah so can it sound

14
00:01:32,698 --> 00:01:34,500
- It's so damn magical!

15
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:36,160
You are so incredibly talented.

16
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:37,640
- Did you hear what did he say?
 Talented, he said.

17
00:01:37,800 --> 00:01:38,680
- Talented!

18
00:01:38,760 --> 00:01:41,640
Did you hear that Bandhagen?
 He is talented ...

19
00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:42,600
No one hears us

20
00:01:42,760 --> 00:01:43,880
- no no one hears us

21
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,400
- He is the official Swedish Kalle Anka.

22
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:47,480
- Hey!

23
00:01:47,480 --> 00:01:48,480
How is it?

24
00:01:49,160 --> 00:01:50,160
How fun!

25
00:01:50,160 --> 00:01:51,160
- That is sick.

26
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:54,920
- Wow!

27
00:01:54,920 --> 00:01:57,440
Books

28
00:01:57,440 --> 00:01:58,920
- Oh, you're read, Kalle.

29
00:01:58,920 --> 00:01:59,920
- Yes so there.

30
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:02,920
- No, like that.
 After all, this is a thousand books.

31
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:03,920
- Is it...?

32
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:05,520
- huh?

33
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:06,520
- What are you saying?

34
00:02:06,520 --> 00:02:07,720
- I think so.

35
00:02:07,720 --> 00:02:09,120
Can I see a little, Kalle Duck?

36
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:10,120
- ne.

37
00:02:10,120 --> 00:02:12,120
- It's copyright, for damn.

38
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:13,120
What did I say?

39
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:15,320
I swearing!

40
00:02:15,320 --> 00:02:17,120
Hello?
 Hello?
 Hello?

41
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:18,120
!

42
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:19,120
Out here!

43
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:20,120
- Yes no, yes no!

44
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:21,120
Kalle?

45
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:23,120
- What is it?

46
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:25,120
Do you want coffee?

47
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:26,120
- Gladly!

48
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:28,120
- Wonderful!
 Gnesta Mölnbo!

49
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:29,120
- huh?

50
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:31,608
But how rich do you get to be Kalle?

51
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:33,120
- Huge!

52
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:34,120
- It's absurd?

53
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:36,120
- poor can be become

54
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:41,120
- You have made a lot of different Swedish voices in all children's programs.

55
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:46,760
- The first five, six years we were seven who made all votes in all series.

56
00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:50,600
- Yes, I'm thinking short break for super marathon-

57
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:51,450
- No!

58
00:02:51,450 --> 00:02:52,258
-with you.

59
00:02:52,258 --> 00:02:53,538
- Is it time?

60
00:02:53,538 --> 00:02:55,800
- Drive through all the most classic votes.

61
00:02:55,960 --> 00:02:57,960
You notice that you are an acting soul.

62
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:04,120
One, two, three, drive!

63
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:06,480
My name is Professor Heinz Doofenshmirtz!

64
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:10,440
Unite everything in a movement for us to reach heaven.

65
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:13,123
I'm going to pick up the car Master Wayne?

66
00:03:13,123 --> 00:03:16,520
Ohana means family

67
00:03:16,520 --> 00:03:17,920
Ahhhhhh

68
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:21,600
Yeah how is it he sounds now, pinocchio in shrek

69
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:26,490
No, no don't put it in the nose.
 Nicke ...

70
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:32,160
Think of something nice, a girl to fight for

71
00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:33,320
*Kalle Duck Sound*

72
00:03:33,320 --> 00:03:35,860
- You never use the voice when you go out on the town or so?

73
00:03:35,860 --> 00:03:37,860
- I work in the hidden.

74
00:03:37,860 --> 00:03:39,860
- It's not very damn right now.

75
00:03:40,860 --> 00:03:41,860
They film us.

76
00:03:42,860 --> 00:03:43,860
- No.

77
00:03:43,860 --> 00:03:44,860
- Yes.

78
00:03:44,860 --> 00:03:47,799
- But you said that this was just between you and me?

79
00:03:47,799 --> 00:03:49,573
- How does this salt bowl sound?

80
00:03:49,573 --> 00:03:51,311
- Salt!

81
00:03:51,311 --> 00:03:54,860
No, if you were to go and take a sprinkler then after work.

82
00:03:54,860 --> 00:03:57,860
I think I'm pretty handsome.

83
00:03:57,860 --> 00:03:58,611
*Kalle Duck Sound*

84
00:03:58,611 --> 00:03:59,860
No no.

85
00:03:59,860 --> 00:04:01,860
- Yes, but now we have been busy a little too.

86
00:04:01,860 --> 00:04:03,860
- Now we have been busy.
 We have got so much on the schedule today.

87
00:04:03,860 --> 00:04:04,860
- Yes Yes.

88
00:04:04,860 --> 00:04:06,860
- Maybe it's time to wave goodbye in slow motion.

89
00:04:06,860 --> 00:04:10,860
It feels like you could wave without we setting slow motion on the camera.

90
00:04:10,860 --> 00:04:12,860
You start practicing.

91
00:04:19,860 --> 00:04:21,860
- A little strange to wave this slowly.

92
00:04:22,860 --> 00:04:24,860
- We can do it in real slowmo if you want.

93
00:04:24,860 --> 00:04:26,860
Thanks for today.

94
00:04:28,860 --> 00:04:30,860
And now it's time to present the next guest.

95
00:04:30,860 --> 00:04:33,860
And we do that with the help of you, Jeppe.

96
00:04:33,860 --> 00:04:38,860
- Time for place number six, Mauri and a new guest in a chacha.

97
00:04:38,860 --> 00:04:40,860
- Maybe more a conversation?
 It's not Lets Dance this

98
00:04:40,860 --> 00:04:45,860
- At the number six, Mauri, in a video call where you get to meet the voice-

99
00:04:45,860 --> 00:04:48,860
-As has made the most commercials in Swedish history.

100
00:04:48,860 --> 00:04:51,860
Receive Mikael Roupé.

101
00:04:51,860 --> 00:04:57,860
- There you have him, the velvet, best -selling and passionate.

102
00:04:57,860 --> 00:04:59,860
Mikael Ropé-

103
00:04:59,860 --> 00:05:00,860
- Hey!

104
00:05:00,860 --> 00:05:04,860
- How many TV advertising have you voting?

105
00:05:04,860 --> 00:05:07,860
- I stopped counting somewhere around 7000-

106
00:05:07,860 --> 00:05:08,860
-7000?

107
00:05:08,860 --> 00:05:09,860
- Yes, 7000

108
00:05:09,860 --> 00:05:12,860
- the largest sell-out in Swedish history-

109
00:05:12,860 --> 00:05:13,860
-and I love it!

110
00:05:13,860 --> 00:05:15,860
- I'm actually a little proud of that.

111
00:05:15,860 --> 00:05:20,860
- But then we can get a taste of this unique voice you have that everyone has heard.

112
00:05:20,860 --> 00:05:23,860
- These are absolutely fantastic prices!
 This is not wise!

113
00:05:23,860 --> 00:05:24,860
1990!

114
00:05:24,860 --> 00:05:26,860
Take care of what you think —-

115
00:05:26,860 --> 00:05:31,980
-Our new suits are completely electric.
 Here we have the new one with Maybelines, you know.

116
00:05:32,140 --> 00:05:33,940
Awesome ...

117
00:05:34,100 --> 00:05:41,100
It went so far that they even started a Facebook group called Dead Jyskman.

118
00:05:41,260 --> 00:05:42,020
It's true.

119
00:05:42,180 --> 00:05:45,620
- I will be so curious if I had sent an advertising text to you.

120
00:05:45,780 --> 00:05:48,700
And then we just see how it comes to life with your voice.

121
00:05:48,860 --> 00:05:50,900
Have you received any email here now with my ...?

122
00:05:51,060 --> 00:05:52,980
- There it came!

123
00:05:53,140 --> 00:05:56,500
This section in paid cooperation with Revolut.

124
00:05:56,500 --> 00:06:00,500

00:06:38,060 --> 00:06:39,500

135
00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:40,500
- No, you should have thanks.

136
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:42,820
- Oh now give you Micke.
 Drive on, drive on.

137
00:06:42,820 --> 00:06:44,620
- But I've listened to this.
 When you are out of surrounding you can spend money.

138
00:06:44,620 --> 00:06:46,940
- Now I think things are going a little too fast, Micke.

139
00:06:46,940 --> 00:06:48,780
Just a little, a little slower.

140
00:06:48,780 --> 00:06:52,620
- When you're abroad you can spend money with your revolving card-

141
00:06:52,620 --> 00:06:56,100
-Os bad fees and with the actual exchange rate.

What fun it has been to talk to you!

149
00:07:20,420 --> 00:07:21,700
- Yes but the same you hear!

150
00:07:21,700 --> 00:07:24,260
Hello then, see you on any radio channel or TV channel.

151
00:07:24,260 --> 00:07:25,700
- We'll do that.
 Hello!

152
00:07:25,700 --> 00:07:27,700
- Welcome back!

153
00:07:27,700 --> 00:07:31,140
Soon you will meet the man with this lean voice.

154
00:07:31,140 --> 00:07:34,900
You will also get a Face Reveal at Alejandro Fuentes Bergström.

155
00:07:34,900 --> 00:07:38,580
And meet the man who says comes to the cinema this fall.

156
00:07:38,580 --> 00:07:41,780
But first, it's time for place number five.

157
00:07:41,780 --> 00:07:46,980
- Now I'm sitting here with coffee, with a pier in my stomach.

158
00:07:47,140 --> 00:07:54,100
Soon I will be joined by the voice that we have all heard most times in life.
 Without registering it.

159
00:07:54,260 --> 00:07:58,540
This voice has heard in local traffic, in telephone exchanges, on radio.

160
00:07:58,700 --> 00:08:01,820
In addition, she has been crowned to be the very miss.

161
00:08:01,980 --> 00:08:07,380
This iconic service that since 1934 has helped people set the clock right.

162
00:08:07,380 --> 00:08:09,940
- You were a little impressive about who to meet.

163
00:08:09,940 --> 00:08:11,220
- Yeah!

164
00:08:11,220 --> 00:08:13,820
- It's still an iconic voice.

165
00:08:13,820 --> 00:08:15,060
- It's the same phone number.

166
00:08:16,220 --> 00:08:16,980
- You know the number?

167
00:08:16,980 --> 00:08:18,260
- Yes, I will never forget that.

168
00:08:18,260 --> 00:08:19,260
- Now you call the Miss now.

169
00:08:19,260 --> 00:08:22,780
13.8.8.

170
00:08:22,780 --> 00:08:23,540
- That's right.

171
00:08:23,540 --> 00:08:25,260
- She knows the time.

172
00:08:25,260 --> 00:08:28,260
- God, you are completely embarrassed.

173
00:08:28,260 --> 00:08:30,980
Hope she keeps time.

174
00:08:30,980 --> 00:08:34,100
We actually said ... yes she is two minutes late.

175
00:08:34,100 --> 00:08:35,300
- No, there she comes.

176
00:08:35,300 --> 00:08:37,100
- There she comes!

177
00:08:37,100 --> 00:08:44,180
Here she comes walking.
 The trustworthy, but above all fantastic.

178
00:08:44,340 --> 00:08:47,340
Johanna Herman Lundberg.

179
00:08:51,220 --> 00:08:53,697
--Wow!
 What a reception!

180
00:08:53,697 --> 00:08:56,127
- I found some fans.

181
00:08:56,260 --> 00:08:58,428
- You may ask where it is.

182
00:08:58,428 --> 00:08:59,583
- Then we call.

183
00:09:00,540 --> 00:09:02,940
No no!

184
00:09:03,100 --> 00:09:05,820
- bowl there on you.
 -Bowl.

185
00:09:05,820 --> 00:09:09,140
- Can you have the voice heard in most places in Sweden?

186
00:09:09,300 --> 00:09:11,540
- Yes, I almost think so.

187
00:09:11,700 --> 00:09:13,300
But...

188
00:09:13,460 --> 00:09:16,060
Now it's starting to rain.

189
00:09:16,220 --> 00:09:18,180
- God what it is raining.

190
00:09:19,900 --> 00:09:23,420
- Can you mention in all the places you hear your voice?

191
00:09:23,580 --> 00:09:29,300
- I am the Swedish Tax Agency, the subway, countless gears.
 Then I have been a bank.
 But I don't know everything.

192
00:09:29,460 --> 00:09:32,700
- Last morning I tried to call a friend, who did not answer.

193
00:09:32,700 --> 00:09:36,700
Who tells me that the person can't take my call right now?

194
00:09:36,700 --> 00:09:37,460
- Is it me?

195
00:09:37,460 --> 00:09:38,460
- Yes you are.

196
00:09:38,460 --> 00:09:39,740
- I don't know.

197
00:09:39,740 --> 00:09:40,740
- It is you!

198
00:09:40,740 --> 00:09:43,940
-"The person you've called is busy in another call."

199
00:09:43,940 --> 00:09:45,308
- Yes, that's me.

200
00:09:45,308 --> 00:09:46,660
"Leave a message after the tone"

201
00:09:46,660 --> 00:09:48,860
I did not know that!

202
00:09:52,100 --> 00:09:56,460
- Can you say that you got the job because you had a slightly more comfortable voice on the cut?

203
00:09:56,460 --> 00:09:59,020
- I had another type of voice.

204
00:09:59,020 --> 00:10:01,420
A little lower, a little more like this ...

205
00:10:01,420 --> 00:10:04,500
I sell that you believe in what I say.

206
00:10:04,660 --> 00:10:08,340
I can read any text, and you believe in that text.

207
00:10:08,500 --> 00:10:14,420
- What can you say that still becomes credible?
 If you had said that Leif GW Persson murdered Palme?

208
00:10:14,580 --> 00:10:17,131
- I think you pull it far.

209
00:10:17,131 --> 00:10:20,783
- Now we go far, but we may still be able to get a prosecution on GW.

210
00:10:21,111 --> 00:10:27,660
I know Leif GW Persson murdered Palme.

211
00:10:31,660 --> 00:10:37,660
On February 28, 1986, Leif GW Persson is in the corner,-

212
00:10:37,660 --> 00:10:43,660
-tunnelgatan, Sveavägen, and waiting for Olof Palme and his wife Lisbeth-

213
00:10:43,660 --> 00:10:48,660
-To he wants to try to get to the perfect crime-

214
00:10:48,660 --> 00:10:51,660
-What he also succeeded.

215
00:10:54,220 --> 00:10:56,383
- Gw, the sick bastard!

216
00:10:56,383 --> 00:10:58,352
- He who chats so much about that all the time.

217
00:10:58,420 --> 00:10:59,764
- He got away.

218
00:10:59,764 --> 00:11:00,900
- Yes, he did.

219
00:11:00,900 --> 00:11:04,660
- You make the voice in the local traffic subway.
 - Yeah.

220
00:11:04,820 --> 00:11:08,700
I have a speaker with me.
 We're going to fuck a little with people.

221
00:11:08,860 --> 00:11:11,940
- Next station.
 The castle.

222
00:11:12,100 --> 00:11:13,798
Fun!

223
00:11:13,798 --> 00:11:15,300
- Now we pull towards the subway.

224
00:11:15,300 --> 00:11:18,140
Excuse me, may I ask you one thing?

225
00:11:18,220 --> 00:11:21,220
- I have gone past you.
 –Wa?

226
00:11:23,020 --> 00:11:26,980
- He didn't talk, right?
 He didn't talk to me.

227
00:11:27,060 --> 00:11:28,900
- God, what fun!

228
00:11:28,980 --> 00:11:34,020
-Info.
 - Bus 1 towards Frihamnen departs in a minute.

229
00:11:34,100 --> 00:11:40,300
- Did you hear the voice?
 - Bus 1 towards Frihamnen departs in 11 minutes.

230
00:11:41,420 --> 00:11:43,740
- Isn't that sick?

231
00:11:43,740 --> 00:11:44,740
- How fun!

232
00:11:44,740 --> 00:11:46,380
- Okay, now we get into the subway here.

233
00:11:46,380 --> 00:11:47,900
- I want to start at once.

234
00:11:47,900 --> 00:11:49,500
I just want to say things.

235
00:11:52,980 --> 00:11:55,980
Next station Västerås.

236
00:11:59,740 --> 00:12:01,980
Next Östermalmstorg.

237
00:12:01,980 --> 00:12:03,820
Mörby center.

238
00:12:03,820 --> 00:12:06,740
Yes, now I talk a little in my mouth.

239
00:12:06,740 --> 00:12:09,740
But then change to Mörby center.

240
00:12:10,660 --> 00:12:11,860
- You got a little minded?

241
00:12:11,860 --> 00:12:12,860
- Yes!

242
00:12:12,860 --> 00:12:14,860
Next Ropsten end station ...

243
00:12:16,860 --> 00:12:18,860
- I thought it was you, it was she.

244
00:12:18,860 --> 00:12:20,860
- You didn't understand that she was talking.

245
00:12:20,860 --> 00:12:22,860
- I didn't even understand.

246
00:12:28,860 --> 00:12:30,860
- But then, thanks for today.

247
00:12:32,860 --> 00:12:34,860
- Is there anything you have left that you want to do?

248
00:12:34,860 --> 00:12:36,860
Is there any dream?

249
00:12:36,860 --> 00:12:38,860
- I still have one thing.

250
00:12:38,860 --> 00:12:40,860
After all, I still want to be a wicked Disney witch.

251
00:12:40,860 --> 00:12:45,860
- But wait, this guy is pretty good at animating and drawing stuff.

252
00:12:45,860 --> 00:12:49,860
After all, we could have arranged a little mini witch role for you.

253
00:12:49,860 --> 00:12:53,860
We could have made a small short film where you are a wicked witch.

254
00:12:53,860 --> 00:12:56,860
And I'm an innocent prince.
 Or what am I?

255
00:12:56,860 --> 00:13:00,860
- Innocent prince?
 Yes, you can get that.
 Or such a small frog or something.

256
00:13:00,860 --> 00:13:04,860
- Okay, I'm a frog and you're a witch.

257
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:12,360
- Hello Hello!
 I'm a nice little frog like going out.

258
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:22,360
- Now I have caught you, little ginger frog!

259
00:13:22,860 --> 00:13:24,860
- What are you going to do with me?

260
00:13:24,860 --> 00:13:31,860
- I need your musty frogs to complete my witch brew.

261
00:13:32,020 --> 00:13:34,980
- Ouch ouch ouch!

262
00:13:35,140 --> 00:13:38,020
It is hot!

263
00:13:38,180 --> 00:13:41,580
- Now it's time for place number four.

264
00:13:41,740 --> 00:13:46,780
- Now we will meet a voice that is in some way TV4.

265
00:13:46,940 --> 00:13:50,220
You have heard him say things like the premiere, September 1 on TV4 and Cmore.

266
00:13:50,220 --> 00:13:54,220
There is something about these vocal cords that almost make a little arrow.

267
00:13:54,220 --> 00:13:56,220
There he is.

268
00:13:56,220 --> 00:13:57,220
Hey!

269
00:13:57,220 --> 00:13:58,220
Hello!

270
00:13:59,220 --> 00:14:01,220
Yes, there you have him.

271
00:14:01,220 --> 00:14:04,220
As velvety as wonderful.

272
00:14:04,220 --> 00:14:06,220
Ola Ringdahl.

273
00:14:06,220 --> 00:14:08,220
- Can we taste you a little?

274
00:14:14,220 --> 00:14:16,220
Premiere at Cmore.

275
00:14:16,220 --> 00:14:18,220
- How long have you been in such a voice?

276
00:14:18,220 --> 00:14:20,220
-25 years.

277
00:14:20,220 --> 00:14:21,432
It has been great fun.

278
00:14:21,432 --> 00:14:22,220
-It's fine now.

279
00:14:22,220 --> 00:14:24,220
- Up and down, now it is not as good anymore.

280
00:14:24,220 --> 00:14:26,220
Ten years ago it was much better.

281
00:14:26,220 --> 00:14:28,220
But I have a job, I should not complain.

282
00:14:28,220 --> 00:14:30,493
- But you're a little out in the cold right now.

283
00:14:30,493 --> 00:14:32,220
- No, not in the cold, I couldn't say that.

284
00:14:32,220 --> 00:14:35,220
- You are completely alone, no one is calling.

285
00:14:35,220 --> 00:14:37,432
- I am single and the children have moved.

286
00:14:37,432 --> 00:14:38,220
-Are you single?

287
00:14:38,220 --> 00:14:40,394
-Yes I am single.

288
00:14:40,394 --> 00:14:41,220
- But God Ola ...

289
00:14:41,220 --> 00:14:42,657
- But do you want a friend?

290
00:14:42,657 --> 00:14:43,220
-Yes.

291
00:14:43,220 --> 00:14:46,220
- But should we go on a buddy date?

292
00:14:46,220 --> 00:14:50,220
See if there can be something so you can get someone who comes out here sometimes and meets you.

293
00:14:50,220 --> 00:14:51,220
- Finally!

294
00:14:51,220 --> 00:14:54,220
- Now we go friend.

295
00:14:54,220 --> 00:14:56,220
Buddy dating

296
00:14:58,220 --> 00:15:01,220
- But I have a funny story.

297
00:15:01,220 --> 00:15:03,220
- Oh, should you invite us to a funny story?

298
00:15:03,220 --> 00:15:04,220
- Yes.

299
00:15:04,220 --> 00:15:06,220
- How long will it be and how fun will it be?

300
00:15:06,220 --> 00:15:09,220
- Very funny and you can tell me how long it should be.

301
00:15:09,220 --> 00:15:13,220
Because I Speaker you can say you have 15 seconds or you have a minute on you.

302
00:15:13,220 --> 00:15:16,660
- You have 20 seconds.
 Time is starting now.

303
00:15:17,540 --> 00:15:22,460
- Many years ago, 20 years ago, I was assigned that I would make the voice a juice package.

304
00:15:23,500 --> 00:15:27,540
And then a nice girl comes into the apartment, the juice packages have a party.

305
00:15:28,020 --> 00:15:30,620
I have the last juice package.
 I can't get away.

306
00:15:30,620 --> 00:15:35,460
So when he opens the refrigerator door, then I stand there and then I should say oh or oops.

307
00:15:36,140 --> 00:15:37,380
So I stand for an hour.

308
00:15:37,380 --> 00:15:39,300
- Oh, there was time out.

309
00:15:39,300 --> 00:15:41,300
Hahahaha!

310
00:15:41,300 --> 00:15:43,300
I'm sorry Ola.

311
00:15:43,300 --> 00:15:45,300
But we must not hear ...

312
00:15:45,300 --> 00:15:49,300
What a fucking anti -climax!

313
00:15:49,300 --> 00:15:50,300
- How the hell do you stand out with him?

314
00:15:50,300 --> 00:15:52,300
So you have a lot in salary or?

315
00:15:52,300 --> 00:15:56,300
We can go to my recording studio if you want and talk.

316
00:15:56,300 --> 00:15:57,300
Voice.

317
00:15:57,300 --> 00:16:00,300
- Lol!
 What a nasty offer!

318
00:16:00,300 --> 00:16:03,300
Want to get into my car and eat sweets?

319
00:16:03,300 --> 00:16:05,300
Hahahaha!

320
00:16:05,300 --> 00:16:08,940
But I think this buddy dating is going very well.

321
00:16:08,940 --> 00:16:10,440
- I think so too.

322
00:16:10,440 --> 00:16:12,440
- Soon you are not alone anymore.

323
00:16:14,440 --> 00:16:16,440
Imagine everyone who will listen to TV4 in the future.

324
00:16:16,440 --> 00:16:18,440
And when they hear your voice now just ...

325
00:16:18,440 --> 00:16:19,740
That's him.

326
00:16:19,740 --> 00:16:21,240
Wonder how he is feeling.

327
00:16:21,240 --> 00:16:22,360
- Do you know what the deppost is?

328
00:16:22,360 --> 00:16:22,860
- No.

329
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:26,040
What?

330
00:16:26,040 --> 00:16:28,540
- I've just got rid of a CMore job.

331
00:16:28,540 --> 00:16:29,860
-  No!

332
00:16:29,860 --> 00:16:33,540
- They put together TV4 Play with CMore and then I am not needed as a voice.

333
00:16:33,540 --> 00:16:35,140
It happened a month ago.

334
00:16:35,140 --> 00:16:37,540
- What, so you have coded that job too, your main job?

335
00:16:37,940 --> 00:16:38,940
- Not too.

336
00:16:45,340 --> 00:16:47,740
- It's been an honor to meet you.

337
00:16:47,740 --> 00:16:52,140
- Thank you, the same to you.
 This is the most fun thing I've done in several days I would say.

338
00:16:52,140 --> 00:16:56,540
- days?
 Nice to hear.
 Have a good one.

339
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:04,506
Now we are in a summery Södermalm together with a very cute cat.

340
00:17:04,694 --> 00:17:11,182
We are here to meet Sweden's most famous computer voice through all times.

341
00:17:11,182 --> 00:17:17,880
She is the voice in GPS, for a long time Siri on the iPhone and is heard almost every time you ask a computer to read something for you.

342
00:17:23,140 --> 00:17:24,540
Hello!

343
00:17:27,340 --> 00:17:36,940
Here you have her, the fantastic, inimitable, multi -talented and above all incredibly good looking Sara Edvardsson.

344
00:17:37,940 --> 00:17:39,340
- Your voice now, say hello.

345
00:17:39,340 --> 00:17:39,940
- Hello!

346
00:17:39,940 --> 00:17:43,740
- It doesn't really sound like the other voice.

347
00:17:43,740 --> 00:17:46,780
- Can you get a taste in what contexts you have heard your voice?

348
00:17:46,780 --> 00:17:48,900
- Welcome to Fredbank.

349
00:17:48,900 --> 00:17:50,100
Call Mom.

350
00:17:50,100 --> 00:17:52,300
Unfortunately, I cannot answer that question.

351
00:17:52,300 --> 00:17:53,500
Turn right.

352
00:17:54,820 --> 00:17:56,100
Stop hamra.

353
00:17:56,100 --> 00:17:58,780
... west out on Kärhågsgatan towards Nytorgsgatan.

354
00:17:58,780 --> 00:17:59,380
- This is not ...

355
00:17:59,380 --> 00:18:00,260
- It's not me.

356
00:18:00,260 --> 00:18:02,620
It is another nice woman that we do not know who it.

357
00:18:02,620 --> 00:18:03,780
- Not very nice.

358
00:18:03,780 --> 00:18:04,740
Bother me a little.

359
00:18:04,740 --> 00:18:05,660
- Right?

360
00:18:05,660 --> 00:18:07,460
Of 400 meters.

361
00:18:07,460 --> 00:18:09,140
Then we will drive left.

362
00:18:10,460 --> 00:18:11,460
Turn right.

363
00:18:11,460 --> 00:18:13,620
-Yey!
 That's me!

364
00:18:13,620 --> 00:18:15,620
- Ey!

365
00:18:15,620 --> 00:18:18,000
- Should you and I have a quick lunch?

366
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:19,067
-I am very hungry.

367
00:18:19,067 --> 00:18:19,780
- Me too!

368
00:18:19,780 --> 00:18:24,580
On the way to the restaurant, we noticed that the taxi driver used a GPS with Sara's voice.

369
00:18:24,740 --> 00:18:26,740
... to the ride towards the center.

370
00:18:26,900 --> 00:18:30,700
- Do you usually have the GPS player's voice?

371
00:18:30,700 --> 00:18:35,701
- No no votes I don't like that about 200 meters turn left no.

372
00:18:38,580 --> 00:18:40,580
It's a bit goofy I think.

373
00:18:40,580 --> 00:18:43,580
- Yes, it's really, really goofy.

374
00:18:43,580 --> 00:18:45,580
- mhmm

375
00:18:45,580 --> 00:18:48,580
- You know that her voice, as you said was hard.

376
00:18:48,580 --> 00:18:51,580
That's her voice.

377
00:18:51,580 --> 00:18:53,044
- No are you kidding?

378
00:18:53,044 --> 00:18:54,580
She is the voice.

379
00:18:54,580 --> 00:18:56,580
- Ne hahaha.

380
00:18:56,580 --> 00:18:58,580
No, but come on.

381
00:18:58,580 --> 00:19:00,580
Do you drive with me or?

382
00:19:00,580 --> 00:19:01,580
- No I don't drive.

383
00:19:03,580 --> 00:19:05,580
So I didn't take anything.

384
00:19:09,034 --> 00:19:13,580
It is not the very voice, it is the directive when you hear.

385
00:19:13,580 --> 00:19:15,580
- Now he is changing history.

386
00:19:19,580 --> 00:19:23,580
- Now I would just like to do a last little experiment with you.

387
00:19:23,580 --> 00:19:28,580
Okay, then it's time to test if we can fool the Stockholmers.

388
00:19:28,580 --> 00:19:32,580
I'll let people test this computer with the world's best AI.

389
00:19:32,580 --> 00:19:35,580
And with a computer voice that everyone recognizes.

390
00:19:35,580 --> 00:19:37,580
Hello Hello!
 That's me.

391
00:19:37,580 --> 00:19:41,580
But in fact, everything is controlled by Sara who sits in this car.

392
00:19:41,580 --> 00:19:46,580
She sees everything, she hears everything and will create the coolest AI experience-

393
00:19:46,580 --> 00:19:48,580
-As the world has seen so far.

394
00:19:48,580 --> 00:19:50,580
Here we go.

395
00:19:50,580 --> 00:19:54,580
- Do you want to test the world's smartest AI so far with me?

396
00:19:54,580 --> 00:19:56,580
You can talk to it, communicate with it.

397
00:19:56,580 --> 00:19:58,430
- For real?

398
00:19:58,430 --> 00:19:59,669
- Yes, yes, yes.

399
00:19:59,669 --> 00:20:00,580
- How are you?

400
00:20:00,580 --> 00:20:02,580
- I feel as I deserve.

401
00:20:02,580 --> 00:20:04,580
- huh?

402
00:20:04,580 --> 00:20:07,580
- Yes, it was a bit AW yesterday you can say.

403
00:20:07,580 --> 00:20:10,580
- So I'm scared by this shit.

404
00:20:10,580 --> 00:20:12,580
I don't like this.

405
00:20:12,580 --> 00:20:14,580
- Test, continue.

406
00:20:14,580 --> 00:20:15,580
- What's your name?

407
00:20:15,580 --> 00:20:17,580
- What do you want me to be called?

408
00:20:17,580 --> 00:20:19,580
- Magdalena.

409
00:20:19,580 --> 00:20:20,580
I do not know.

410
00:20:20,580 --> 00:20:23,580
- I want to be your Magdalena.

411
00:20:23,580 --> 00:20:25,580
- Oh no, no that is enough.

412
00:20:25,580 --> 00:20:27,580
- It feels scary.

413
00:20:27,580 --> 00:20:29,580
- I hate this kind of crap.

414
00:20:29,580 --> 00:20:32,300
- It is almost nasty how far they have come with the technology.

415
00:20:35,300 --> 00:20:36,300
- No, for real?

416
00:20:37,260 --> 00:20:39,260
No, but damn!

417
00:20:42,180 --> 00:20:44,180
So, you got to get shivers.

418
00:20:44,860 --> 00:20:47,220
- In a hundred meters turn right.

419
00:20:47,900 --> 00:20:49,380
- Fy damn, that sounds ...

420
00:20:49,380 --> 00:20:51,380
- God, you are frightened for life.

421
00:20:52,860 --> 00:20:53,860
- It's cool.

422
00:20:54,860 --> 00:20:55,860
- What the hell.

423
00:20:56,460 --> 00:20:57,900
No, that is scary.

424
00:20:57,900 --> 00:20:59,900
- Damn.

425
00:20:59,900 --> 00:21:01,900
Okay, wow!

426
00:21:01,900 --> 00:21:03,900
- What will the next government look like?

427
00:21:03,900 --> 00:21:06,900
- It depends on how you and your friends vote.

428
00:21:06,900 --> 00:21:10,900
Probably you will vote a little to the right.

429
00:21:10,900 --> 00:21:12,900
- Yes, it can be true.

430
00:21:12,900 --> 00:21:14,900
- Do you have any dating tips?

431
00:21:17,900 --> 00:21:19,900
- Just make them listen.

432
00:21:22,900 --> 00:21:24,900
- It feels like you are disappointed.

433
00:21:24,900 --> 00:21:26,900
- But what the hell?

434
00:21:26,900 --> 00:21:28,900
- She was the one who was sitting in the car.

435
00:21:28,900 --> 00:21:30,900
- It's sick.

436
00:21:30,900 --> 00:21:32,900
- So it's just scam?

437
00:21:32,900 --> 00:21:34,900
- Yes, it's scam.
 We are engaged in scams.

438
00:21:34,900 --> 00:21:37,900
Maybe we should stop making people disappointed and thank you for today instead.

439
00:21:37,900 --> 00:21:39,900
Maybe we should do it anyway.

440
00:21:45,900 --> 00:21:53,900
- And now it's time for a historic Face Reveal on Sweden's perhaps most beloved stuffed animal.

441
00:21:53,900 --> 00:21:58,660
Now it will be about the Chilean monkey Alejandro Fuentes Bergström.

442
00:21:58,820 --> 00:22:04,260
He appeared on television for the first time in 2006 and has since reached a cult status in Sweden.

443
00:22:04,420 --> 00:22:10,660
He has been on television, radio, advertisements, music videos, but we have only seen the monkey.

444
00:22:10,820 --> 00:22:17,260
Today, the man behind the voice for the first time will show his face in Swedish television.

445
00:22:17,420 --> 00:22:23,340
- But before that we have to get acquainted with Alejandro himself, of course.

446
00:22:23,340 --> 00:22:26,220
So, we are so boundlessly peppered.

447
00:22:26,380 --> 00:22:28,380
There he comes.

448
00:22:29,820 --> 00:22:32,900
- Hejsan Svejsan, my name is Alejandro Fuentes-Bergström.

449
00:22:33,060 --> 00:22:35,100
You are very welcome to my house.

450
00:22:35,260 --> 00:22:38,540
I hope it will be good to taste.

451
00:22:39,540 --> 00:22:40,995
-Otherwise?

452
00:22:40,995 --> 00:22:42,995
-Yes it is good.
 Yourself?

453
00:22:43,220 --> 00:22:44,620
- It mopes and goes.

454
00:22:44,780 --> 00:22:50,100
This is the first time I talk to a redhead guy actually

455
00:22:50,100 --> 00:22:53,700
We had a scared man in the village where I grew up.

456
00:22:53,860 --> 00:22:55,540
But I didn't talk to him.

457
00:22:55,700 --> 00:22:59,420
I'd rather not talk about inbreeding problems.

458
00:22:59,580 --> 00:23:01,740
But he could be a little violent.

459
00:23:01,900 --> 00:23:06,380
- You are known for your structure.
 Are you just as good at it now?

460
00:23:06,540 --> 00:23:10,060
- Of course.
 Thinking structure is not a fashion fly.

461
00:23:10,220 --> 00:23:15,100
I think it is a matter of course to have a structure that is hardworked.

462
00:23:15,980 --> 00:23:19,140
- Then Alejandro wanted to invite me to some tacos.

463
00:23:19,140 --> 00:23:21,140
I note that you have patches on each bowl.

464
00:23:21,140 --> 00:23:22,140
- It's better control.

465
00:23:22,140 --> 00:23:27,140
If you use two different senses, then you are faster, reptile fast.

466
00:23:28,140 --> 00:23:32,140
- You are so Beautiful.
 I like you very much.

467
00:23:32,140 --> 00:23:39,140
- Do you belong to the other kind, that you have gay?

468
00:23:40,140 --> 00:23:44,140
Then I think we can continue this dinner and have a good time.

469
00:23:44,140 --> 00:23:45,140
- Yes, we do so.

470
00:23:45,140 --> 00:23:52,340
- Fresh cream, avocado, meat three, salad, a mock cup, small bowl and tomato square.

471
00:23:52,500 --> 00:23:54,620
- Let yourself taste.

472
00:23:54,780 --> 00:23:55,460
- What did you say?

473
00:23:55,620 --> 00:23:58,180
- Let yourself taste.

474
00:23:59,100 --> 00:24:02,340
- Let yourself taste?

475
00:24:02,740 --> 00:24:03,540
- As I said.

476
00:24:10,660 --> 00:24:13,620
- I thought about what we talked about before with gay and stuff?

477
00:24:13,620 --> 00:24:20,020
- I think you have a problem that addresses that topic all the time.

478
00:24:20,180 --> 00:24:26,460
You stare and try to provoke a gay from me.

479
00:24:26,620 --> 00:24:32,860
- It is so difficult to determine where you are on this issue.
 You are for everyone to love who they want?

480
00:24:33,020 --> 00:24:37,020
- At the right time, in the right place, at the right time.

481
00:24:37,180 --> 00:24:39,700
- What do you even mean at the right time?

482
00:24:39,700 --> 00:24:42,780
- What time .. You have to plan a socializing.

483
00:24:42,940 --> 00:24:46,620
It can't be random people you meet.

484
00:24:46,780 --> 00:24:50,700
And they come to you and you have social holes about noise.

485
00:24:50,860 --> 00:24:55,180
Chin Chin, Mauri.
 I think you're really nice guy.

486
00:24:55,340 --> 00:24:59,500
- Thanks, Alejandro.
 The same, bowl.

487
00:24:59,660 --> 00:25:04,020
And now my ladies and gentlemen.
 Is it time for the historical moment-

488
00:25:04,020 --> 00:25:09,820
-When we should meet the man behind Alejandro.

489
00:25:09,980 --> 00:25:12,260
- What?
 What?
 What did you say?

490
00:25:12,420 --> 00:25:16,940
- We'll meet the man behind you.

491
00:25:17,100 --> 00:25:19,100
- Welcome.

492
00:25:22,940 --> 00:25:24,940
- Smoke machine.

493
00:25:27,620 --> 00:25:30,100
Oh, it's bad with smoke.
 There will be no smoke.

494
00:25:30,100 --> 00:25:33,300
It came anyway.
 1, 2, 3!

495
00:25:48,020 --> 00:25:49,180
You can really get around?

496
00:25:49,180 --> 00:25:49,680
- Yes.

497
00:25:49,680 --> 00:25:50,180
- and put you?

498
00:25:50,180 --> 00:25:50,680
- I sit down.

499
00:25:50,680 --> 00:25:52,680
- How did you even find this character?

500
00:25:52,680 --> 00:25:53,720
How did it arise?

501
00:25:53,720 --> 00:25:57,560
- It was me and Martin Marklund, screenwriter, Sweden's best.

502
00:25:57,560 --> 00:26:00,840
We were on a movie recording and then we found Alejandro.

503
00:26:00,840 --> 00:26:02,120
We just saw his eyes on him.

504
00:26:02,120 --> 00:26:03,760
And then we started testing different dialects.

505
00:26:03,760 --> 00:26:06,760
And then we started tanning as hell when we came to the Spanish Swedish.

506
00:26:06,760 --> 00:26:08,840
Because it was not so used in any way right then.

507
00:26:08,840 --> 00:26:09,340
- mm.

508
00:26:09,340 --> 00:26:10,200
- Fifteen years ago.

509
00:26:10,200 --> 00:26:12,800
- But do you have any parent from South America?

510
00:26:12,800 --> 00:26:13,720
- No.

511
00:26:13,720 --> 00:26:15,240
My parents are from Poland.

512
00:26:15,800 --> 00:26:16,300
- huh?

513
00:26:16,300 --> 00:26:16,800
- Yes.

514
00:26:16,800 --> 00:26:18,800
We can speak Polish if you want.

515
00:26:18,800 --> 00:26:20,320
Slightly.

516
00:26:20,320 --> 00:26:21,720
With a Polish break.

517
00:26:22,840 --> 00:26:23,640
- Thanks.

518
00:26:23,640 --> 00:26:25,040
- Thank you, Mauri.

519
00:26:25,040 --> 00:26:27,040
You are very sympathetic.

520
00:26:27,040 --> 00:26:28,040
Actually.

521
00:26:28,040 --> 00:26:31,040
I hope we get to meet again sometime.

522
00:26:31,040 --> 00:26:33,040
- I hope so too.

523
00:26:36,040 --> 00:26:39,040
- My ladies and gentlemen, it's time for place number one.

524
00:26:39,040 --> 00:26:42,040
Mauri goes out far to sea on a deserted island

525
00:26:42,040 --> 00:26:47,040
-To meet a man who has never shown his face to the Swedish people.

526
00:26:48,040 --> 00:26:50,040
- Out here in a wonderfully summery Stockholm archipelago-

527
00:26:50,040 --> 00:26:53,040
-Bore Sweden's trailer voice number one.

528
00:26:53,040 --> 00:26:55,040
You've all heard hono say-

529
00:26:55,040 --> 00:26:56,840
-Coming to the cinema this fall.

530
00:26:56,840 --> 00:26:57,640
Or...

531
00:26:57,640 --> 00:26:59,640
And the nominees are ...

532
00:26:59,640 --> 00:27:03,440
And now we will meet the man behind that voice.

533
00:27:03,840 --> 00:27:04,640
Inside.

534
00:27:06,840 --> 00:27:08,840
HE HE HE HE HE HE HE HE!

535
00:27:10,240 --> 00:27:12,040
- Yes, there he is.

536
00:27:12,440 --> 00:27:15,440
The man with Sweden's perhaps sexiest voice.

537
00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:18,640
The One and Only, Benke Skogholt.

538
00:27:19,840 --> 00:27:24,240
- Can we just hear you say those things you usually say?

539
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:30,040
- The nominees are, out in the fall, a man, a mission.

540
00:27:30,200 --> 00:27:35,640
- It also feels like a real women's magnet to have that voice.

541
00:27:35,800 --> 00:27:39,800
- Yes, yes, yes.
 Well, yes, yes.

542
00:27:39,960 --> 00:27:43,640
- Now Benke got a little shy.

543
00:27:43,800 --> 00:27:46,186
-How has been your job for a long time?

544
00:27:46,186 --> 00:27:49,387
- Oh since the advertising radio came to Sweden.

545
00:27:49,640 --> 00:27:51,640
- And it's been your full -time job ever since?

546
00:27:51,640 --> 00:27:54,640
- Yes, I am a musician too.

547
00:27:54,640 --> 00:27:55,640
- You can sing too?

548
00:27:55,640 --> 00:27:58,640
- Yes I can.

549
00:28:02,394 --> 00:28:04,370
- You say you Hurt.

550
00:28:04,370 --> 00:28:06,889
Almost Lost Your Mind.

551
00:28:06,889 --> 00:28:09,300
The Man You Love.

552
00:28:09,300 --> 00:28:11,557
Treat you so unkind.

553
00:28:11,640 --> 00:28:13,640
- Have you ever been on TV this way?

554
00:28:13,640 --> 00:28:14,640
- No.

555
00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:17,880
- Here he is.

556
00:28:20,040 --> 00:28:21,720
Oh, such a thing too.

557
00:28:21,720 --> 00:28:25,120
- Yes, Peace.
 Or double peace.

558
00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:26,120
- Oh!

559
00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:28,440
- Double Peace.

560
00:28:28,440 --> 00:28:32,440
You love Him, Stick to Him Like Glue.

561
00:28:33,720 --> 00:28:36,240
- Scrap militarism.

562
00:28:36,240 --> 00:28:38,240
War is a disaster.

563
00:28:38,240 --> 00:28:40,240
It hurts me too.

564
00:28:42,342 --> 00:28:45,854
And then an incredible amount of money should be spent on it.

565
00:28:45,854 --> 00:28:48,800
Build roads, schools, hospitals, amusement parks.

566
00:28:48,800 --> 00:28:49,653
Double Peace

567
00:28:49,653 --> 00:28:53,240
- Is this this that we the recipe for a good voice?

568
00:28:53,240 --> 00:28:57,691
- It can be part of it.
 That and whiskey.

569
00:28:59,005 --> 00:29:01,520
- And then we end this with what you can call it ..

570
00:29:01,520 --> 00:29:05,240
Can you call it Benka Skogholt diet?
 So what has created your voice maybe.

571
00:29:05,240 --> 00:29:08,240
A cig and a whiskey.

572
00:29:08,240 --> 00:29:11,240
- If you end it, the question is at all.

573
00:29:11,240 --> 00:29:14,240
- Once the whiskey is now, it feels stupid to stop.

574
00:29:14,240 --> 00:29:16,240
- Yes, of course, now we drive.

575
00:29:16,240 --> 00:29:18,240
Now the plug is out.

576
00:29:19,240 --> 00:29:20,240
Cheers, Mauri.

577
00:29:20,240 --> 00:29:21,240
- Into the fog.

578
00:29:21,240 --> 00:29:23,240
- Now we sweep.

579
00:29:26,240 --> 00:29:28,240
- That tasted good.

580
00:29:34,240 --> 00:29:35,240
- You and I Benke.

581
00:29:35,240 --> 00:29:37,240
- Yes, it's you and me, Mauri.

582
00:29:37,240 --> 00:29:38,240
Crikey.

583
00:29:47,240 --> 00:29:49,240
- Yes, it tear well that.

584
00:29:50,240 --> 00:29:52,240
- Cheers!

585
00:29:53,240 --> 00:29:55,240
I actually have one thing I've dreamed about.

586
00:29:55,240 --> 00:29:57,240
We on assignment food have never won a prize.

587
00:29:57,240 --> 00:29:58,240
- Oh really?

588
00:29:58,240 --> 00:30:01,240
- And you tend to be the one who always says who ...

589
00:30:01,240 --> 00:30:04,800
- Yes, I usually talk about who has received it and who is nominated and so on.

590
00:30:05,280 --> 00:30:07,280
We look for here.

591
00:30:10,560 --> 00:30:14,880
And the winner of Benke Skogolt's whiskey prize is ...

592
00:30:15,240 --> 00:30:16,920
- Wait wait!
 Could you say this?

593
00:30:17,040 --> 00:30:19,600
Not in just want to be cool first.

594
00:30:19,840 --> 00:30:21,920
- Is, not in Want to Be Cool.

595
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:23,600
Not Joakim Lundell.

596
00:30:23,920 --> 00:30:25,440
- Not Therese Lindgren.

597
00:30:25,480 --> 00:30:27,520
- Not Therese Lindgren, but ...

598
00:30:27,560 --> 00:30:29,240
- And damn not RMM either.

599
00:30:29,240 --> 00:30:33,720
- Benke Skogholt's whiskey prize.

600
00:30:33,720 --> 00:30:34,720
- 2023.

601
00:30:34,720 --> 00:30:36,720
- 1920-23.

602
00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:37,720
I was saying hehe.

603
00:30:43,240 --> 00:30:45,240
And the winner is ...

604
00:30:45,240 --> 00:30:47,240
Assignment food.

605
00:30:48,640 --> 00:30:49,640
You are welcome.

606
00:30:51,040 --> 00:30:52,040
Then you get the note here.

607
00:30:52,040 --> 00:30:57,240
- So damn poor gala with such a damn expensive voice.

608
00:30:57,240 --> 00:31:00,040
- It entitles to another whiskey.

609
00:31:00,640 --> 00:31:01,920
- Is it a whiskey until now?

610
00:31:01,920 --> 00:31:02,920
- Yes, yes, yes.

611
00:31:04,280 --> 00:31:05,280
- Cheers!

612
00:31:19,920 --> 00:31:22,120
And so I had finally met them all.

613
00:31:22,400 --> 00:31:24,920
The cushioning, busy Kalle Duck.

614
00:31:24,920 --> 00:31:31,640
Legend Mikael Roupé, Johanna Hermann Lundberg as warm in the soul as in his voice.

615
00:31:31,640 --> 00:31:37,920
The permeable Ola Ringdahl, everyone's our computer voice Sara Edvardsson.

616
00:31:37,920 --> 00:31:42,920
Alejandro and his equally wonderful father, and finally Benke Skogholt-

617
00:31:42,920 --> 00:31:46,560
-When you would have liked to spend time with for the rest of your life.

618
00:31:46,560 --> 00:31:49,560
Thanks to Revolut!

619
00:31:54,291 --> 00:31:56,742
- It has been an honor to meet you Alejandro.

620
00:31:57,117 --> 00:31:58,425
I'm a big fan.

621
00:31:58,922 --> 00:32:00,922
- Thank you who says it.

622
00:32:01,560 --> 00:32:03,560
Are you gay?
