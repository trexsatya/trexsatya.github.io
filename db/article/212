E.g. Some lizards can reproduce without sex but they have also developed mechanism to borrow genetic variation. Some fishes and other animals can change sex as if sex is a strategy. Some can switch sex on and off. Asexual cloning came to happen due to loneliness, some animal got on a different island and found no partners there. It has been recorded in zoo as well.</p>\n\n<p>When you have two gametes in organisms, there would be males and females, and then the rules they follow are kind of universal.</p>\n\n<p>Of the around 5k mammals discovered so far, half of them are species of rodents, 1/4th are species of bats, and only one Humans show the following behavior: They have enlarged breasts on front even when not lactating. This is thought to be because it helped females advertise that they are fertile, they have resources to produce offsprings. This is also thought to have been evolved to hide the outright display of fertility/sexual-availability (e.g. enlarged breasts it&#39;s constant, so it doesn&#39;t tell anything) to avoid coercive sex.</p>\n\n<p>Sex for pleasure is very rare in animal kingdom (e.g. humans, dolphins, bonobos...)</p>\n\n<p>Humans have been polygamous, but it seems that now it&#39;s shifting to monogomy because of the cost of raising offsprings and taking care of the mother.</p>\n\n<p>Males have had two strategies evolutionarily: offer to help in raising child, produce child without any exchange for help. The second one is like lottery, because women have evolutionarily opposed this strategy as they need help in raising child. In present day, advertisers use this evolutionarily embedded nature of men by exploiting &quot;hotness&quot; of women.</p>\n\n<p>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madonna%E2%80%93whore_complex</p>\n\n<p>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helicopter_parent</p>\n\n<p>Birth control has changed a lot sexually, but it&#39;s still new and can&#39;t override the hard-wiring of evolution so easily.</p>\n\n<p>https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7640261-sex-at-dawn This book has cherry-picked some facts to present a particular view - Bret Weinstein</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h2>THEORY OF EVOLUTION</h2>\n\n<p id=\"firstHeading\" lang=\"en\">(Phenotypic) traits: The complete set of observable traits of the structure and behavior of an organism is called its <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phenotype\" title=\"Phenotype\">Phenotype</a>.</p>\n\n<p lang=\"en\">Heritable: The ability of passing on traits from parents to children.
