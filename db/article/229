{"name":"Plato on Love","id":229,"content":"<p>Two of Plato&#39;s books discuss Love: Phaedrus &amp; Symposium.</p>\n\n<h2>Phaedrus</h2>\n\n<p>Socrates meets Phaedrus who has just come after meeting with Lysias and Socrates insists to know about their discussion.</p>\n\n<p>Phaedrus (<em>reads the speech of Lysias</em>): ...Lovers repent of the kindnesses which they have shown when their passion ceases, but to the non-lovers who are free and not under any compulsion, no time of repentance ever comes; for they confer their benefits according to the measure of their ability, in the way which is most conducive to their own interest.</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#8e44ad;\"><em>[What happens when the passion ceases? - Repent?]</em></span></p>\n\n<p>Then again, lovers consider how by reason of their love they have neglected their own concerns and rendered service to others: and when to these benefits conferred they add on the troubles which they have endured, they think that they have long ago made to the beloved a very ample return. But the non-lover has no such tormenting recollections; he has never neglected his affairs or quarrelled with his relations; he has no troubles to add up or excuses to invent; and being well rid of all these evils, why should he not freely do what will gratify the beloved?</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#8e44ad;\"><em>[Do lovers endure for the sake of beloved? Or, do they enjoy? What happens after the passion ceases?]</em></span></p>\n\n<p>If you say that the lover is more to be esteemed, because his love is thought to be greater; for he is willing to say and do what is hateful to other men, in order to please his beloved;&mdash;that, if true, is only a proof that he will prefer any future love to his present, and will injure his old love at the pleasure of the new.</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#8e44ad;\"><em>[Why does one choose a lover over others? What if he sees the same passion but in greater amount in someone else than the lover? Second love? Third love?..]</em></span></p>\n\n<p>And how, in a matter of such infinite importance, can a man be right in trusting himself to one who is afflicted with a malady which no experienced person would attempt to cure, for the patient himself admits that he is not in his right mind, and acknowledges that he is wrong in his mind, but says that he is unable to control himself? And if he came to his right mind, would he ever imagine that the desires were good which he conceived when in his wrong mind?</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#8e44ad;\"><em>[Lovers admit that they might not be in the right mind when in love? Were his desires good then considering that he was not in his right mind?]</em></span></p>\n\n<p>Once more, there are many more non-lovers than lovers; and if you choose the best of the lovers, you will not have many to choose from; but if from the non-lovers, the choice will be larger, and you will be far more likely to find among them a person who is worthy of your friendship.</p>\n\n<p>If public opinion be your dread, and you would avoid reproach, in all probability the lover, who is always thinking that other men are as emulous of him as he is of them, will boast to some one of his successes, and make a show of them openly in the pride of his heart;&mdash;he wants others to know that his labour has not been lost; but the non-lover is more his own master, and is desirous of solid good, and not of the opinion of mankind.</p>\n\n<p>Again, the lover may be generally noted or seen following the beloved (this is his regular occupation), and whenever they are observed to exchange two words they are supposed to meet about some affair of love either past or in contemplation; but when non-lovers meet, no one asks the reason why, because people know that talking to another is natural, whether friendship or mere pleasure be the motive.</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#8e44ad;\"><em>[Are lovers occupied in just following the beloved, meet only about some&nbsp;affair of love either in past or present?]</em></span></p>\n\n<p>Once more, if you fear the fickleness of friendship, consider that in any other case a quarrel might be a mutual calamity; but now, when you have given up what is most precious to you, you will be the greater loser, and therefore, you will have more reason in being afraid of the lover, for his vexations are many, and he is always fancying that every one is leagued against him.</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#8e44ad;\"><em>[Do lovers&nbsp;surrender in love unjustly?]</em></span></p>\n\n<p>Wherefore also he debars his beloved from society; he will not have you intimate with the wealthy, lest they should exceed him in wealth, or with men of education, lest they should be his superiors in understanding; and he is equally afraid of anybody&#39;s influence who has any other advantage over himself.</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#8e44ad;\"><em>[Do lovers debar, disconnect the beloved from the society out of jealousy?]</em></span></p>\n\n<p>If he can persuade you to break with them, you are left without a friend in the world; or if, out of a regard to your own interest, you have more sense than to comply with his desire, you will have to quarrel with him.</p>\n\n<p>But those who are non-lovers, and whose success in love is the reward of their merit, will not be jealous of the companions of their beloved, and will rather hate those who refuse to be his associates, thinking that their favourite is slighted by the latter and benefited by the former; for more love than hatred may be expected to come to him out of his friendship with others.</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#8e44ad;\"><em>[Do Lovers make the beloved devoid of other friendships?]</em></span></p>\n\n<p>Many lovers too have loved the person of a youth before they knew his character or his belongings; so that when their passion has passed away, there is no knowing whether they will continue to be his friends; whereas, in the case of non-lovers who were always friends, the friendship is not lessened by the favours granted; but the recollection of these remains with them, and is an earnest of good things to come.</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#8e44ad;\"><em>[Do lovers have more difficulty in remaining friends after their passion is over?]</em></span></p>\n\n<p>Further, I say that you are likely to be improved by me <em>[non-lover]</em>, whereas the lover will spoil you. For they praise your words and actions in a wrong way; partly, because they are afraid of offending you, and also, their judgment is weakened by passion.</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#8e44ad;\"><em>[Do Lovers spoil the beloved by tainted judgement, overly praising etc?]</em></span></p>\n\n<p>Such are the feats which love exhibits; he makes things painful to the disappointed which give no pain to others; he compels the successful lover to praise what ought not to give him pleasure, and therefore the beloved is to be pitied rather than envied. But if you listen to me <em>[non-lover]</em>, in the first place, I, in my intercourse with you, shall not merely regard present enjoyment, but also future advantage, being not mastered by love, but my own master; nor for small causes taking violent dislikes, but even when the cause is great, slowly laying up little wrath&mdash;unintentional offences I shall forgive, and intentional ones I shall try to prevent; and these are the marks of a friendship which will last.</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#8e44ad;\"><em>[Do Lovers find themselves bound so much they can&#39;t enjoy what they like, and small causes turn into big matters like fighting over small things?]</em></span></p>\n\n<p><strong>Do you think that a lover only can be a firm friend? reflect:&mdash;if this were true, we should set small value on sons, or fathers, or mothers; nor should we ever have loyal friends, for our love of them arises not from passion, but from other associations.</strong></p>\n\n<p>Further, if we ought to shower favours on those who are the most eager suitors,&mdash;on that principle, we ought always to do good, not to the most virtuous, but to the most needy; for they are the persons who will be most relieved, and will therefore be the most grateful; and when you make a feast you should invite not your friend, but the beggar and the empty soul; for they will love you, and attend you, and come about your doors, and will be the best pleased, and the most grateful, and will invoke many a blessing on your head.</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#8e44ad;\">Yet surely you ought not to be granting favours to those who besiege you with prayer, but to those who are best able to reward you; nor to the lover only, but to those who are worthy of love; nor to those who will enjoy the bloom of your youth, but to those who will share their possessions with you in age; nor to those who, having succeeded, will glory in their success to others, but to those who will be modest and tell no tales; nor to those who care about you for a moment only, but to those who will continue your friends through life; nor to those who, when their passion is over, will pick a quarrel with you, but rather to those who, when the charm of youth has left you, will show their own virtue.</span></p>\n\n<p>Remember what I have said; and consider yet this further point: friends admonish the lover under the idea that his way of life is bad, but no one of his kindred ever yet censured the non-lover, or thought that he was ill-advised about his own interests.</p>\n\n<p>Now love ought to be for the advantage of both parties, and for the injury of neither.</p>\n\n<p><em>[Socrates says that he is impressed by the speech, but has some other points although he does not consider himself qualified to compete Lysias in ex-tempore speech]</em></p>\n\n<p>Socrates: .... let us first of all agree in defining the nature and power of love, and then, keeping our eyes upon the definition and to this appealing, let us further enquire whether love brings advantage or disadvantage.</p>\n\n<p>Every one sees that love is a desire, and we know also that non-lovers desire the beautiful and good.&nbsp;<span style=\"color:#8e44ad;\"><em>[LOVE = DESIRE]</em></span></p>\n\n<p>Now in what way is the lover to be distinguished from the non-lover?</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#8e44ad;\"><em>[WHAT IS A LOVER? WHAT IS A NON-LOVER?]</em></span></p>\n\n<p>Let us note that in every one of us there are two guiding and ruling principles which lead us whither they will; <span style=\"color:#8e44ad;\"><strong>one is the natural desire of pleasure</strong></span>, the other is an <span style=\"color:#8e44ad;\"><strong>acquired opinion which aspires after the best</strong></span>; and these two are sometimes in harmony and then again at war, and sometimes the one, sometimes the other conquers.</p>\n\n<p>When opinion by the help of reason leads us to the best, the conquering principle is called <span style=\"color:#8e44ad;\"><strong>temperance</strong></span>; but when desire, which is devoid of reason, rules in us and drags us to pleasure, that power of misrule is called <span style=\"color:#8e44ad;\"><strong>excess</strong></span>.</p>\n\n<p>Now excess has many names, and many members, and many forms, and any of these forms when very marked gives a name, neither honourable nor creditable, to the bearer of the name.</p>\n\n<p>The desire of eating, for example, which gets the better of the higher reason and the other desires, is called gluttony, and he who is possessed by it is called a glutton; the tyrannical desire of drink, which inclines the possessor of the desire to drink, has a name which is only too obvious, and there can be as little doubt by what name any other appetite of the same family would be called;&mdash;it will be the name of that which happens to be dominant.</p>\n\n<p>And now I think that you will perceive the drift of my discourse; but as every spoken word is in a manner plainer than the unspoken, I had better say further that <span style=\"color:#8e44ad;\">the irrational desire which overcomes the tendency of opinion towards right, and is led away to the enjoyment of beauty, and especially of personal beauty, by the desires which are her own kindred&mdash;that supreme desire, I say, which by leading conquers and by the force of passion is reinforced, from this very force, receiving a name, is called love (erromenos eros)</span>.&#39;</p>\n\n<p>Thus, my friend, we have declared and defined the nature of the subject. Keeping the definition in view, let us now enquire what advantage or disadvantage is likely to ensue from the lover or the non-lover to him who accepts their advances.</p>\n\n<p>He who is the victim of his passions and the slave of pleasure will of course desire to make his beloved as agreeable to himself as possible. Now to him who has a mind diseased anything is agreeable which is not opposed to him, but that which is equal or superior is hateful to him, and therefore the lover will not brook any superiority or equality on the part of his beloved; he is always employed in reducing him to inferiority.</p>\n\n<p>And the ignorant is the inferior of the wise, the coward of the brave, the slow of speech of the speaker, the dull of the clever.</p>\n\n<p>These, and not these only, are the mental defects of the beloved;&mdash;defects which, when implanted by nature, are necessarily a delight to the lover, and when not implanted, he must contrive to implant them in him, if he would not be deprived of his fleeting joy.</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#8e44ad;\"><em>[And in such way, do lovers drag the beloved to inferiority?]</em></span></p>\n\n<p>And therefore he cannot help being jealous, and will debar his beloved from the advantages of society which would make a man of him, and especially from that society which would have given him wisdom, and thereby he cannot fail to do him great harm.</p>\n\n<p>That is to say, in his excessive fear lest he should come to be despised in his eyes he will be compelled to banish from him divine philosophy; and there is no greater injury which he can inflict upon him than this. He will contrive that his beloved shall be wholly ignorant, and in everything shall look to him; he is to be the delight of the lover&#39;s heart, and a curse to himself. <span style=\"color:#8e44ad;\"><strong>Verily, a lover is a profitable guardian and associate for him in all that relates to his mind</strong></span>.</p>\n\n<p>Let us next see how his master, whose law of life is pleasure and not good, will keep and train the body of his servant. <span style=\"color:#8e44ad;\">Will he not choose a beloved who is delicate rather than sturdy and strong?</span></p>\n\n<p>One brought up in shady bowers and not in the bright sun, a stranger to manly exercises and the sweat of toil, accustomed only to a soft and luxurious diet, instead of the hues of health having the colours of paint and ornament, and the rest of a piece?&mdash;such a life as any one can imagine and which I need not detail at length.</p>\n\n<p>But I may sum up all that I have to say in a word, and pass on. <span style=\"color:#8e44ad;\">Such a person in war, or in any of the great crises of life, will be the anxiety of his friends and also of his lover, and certainly not the terror of his enemies</span>; which nobody can deny.</p>\n\n<p>And now let us tell what advantage or disadvantage the beloved will receive from the guardianship and society of his lover in the matter of his property; this is the next point to be considered.</p>\n\n<p>The lover will be the first to see what, indeed, will be sufficiently evident to all men, that he desires above all things to deprive his beloved of his dearest and best and holiest possessions, father, mother, kindred, friends, of all whom he thinks may be hinderers or reprovers of their most sweet converse; he will even cast a jealous eye upon his gold and silver or other property, because these make him a less easy prey, and when caught less manageable; hence he is of necessity displeased at his possession of them and rejoices at their loss; and he would like him to be wifeless, childless, homeless, as well; and the longer the better, for the longer he is all this, the longer he will enjoy him.</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#8e44ad;\"><em>[Do lovers secretly feel unease about the affiliations and the possessions of the beloved which might hinder their sweet converse?]</em></span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#8e44ad;\">There are some sort of animals, such as flatterers, who are dangerous and mischievous enough, and yet nature has mingled a temporary pleasure and grace in their composition. You may say that a courtesan <em>(</em></span>a prostitute, especially one with wealthy or upper-class clients<span style=\"color:#8e44ad;\"><em>)</em> is hurtful, and disapprove of such creatures and their practices, and yet for the time they are very pleasant.</span></p>\n\n<p>But the lover is not only hurtful to his love; he is also an extremely disagreeable companion. The old proverb says that &#39;birds of a feather flock together&#39;; I suppose that equality of years inclines them to the same pleasures, and similarity begets friendship; yet you may have more than enough even of this; and verily constraint is always said to be grievous. Now the lover is not only unlike his beloved, but he forces himself upon him.</p>\n\n<p>For he is old and his love is young, and neither day nor night will he leave him if he can help; necessity and the sting of desire drive him on, and allure him with the pleasure which he receives from seeing, hearing, touching, perceiving him in every way.</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#8e44ad;\">And therefore he is delighted to fasten upon him and to minister to him. But what pleasure or consolation can the beloved be receiving all this time?</span> Must he not feel the extremity of disgust when he looks at an old shrivelled <em>(wrinkled and shrunken, especially as a result of loss of moisture or old age)</em> face and the remainder to match, which even in a description is disagreeable, and quite detestable when he is forced into daily contact with his lover; moreover he is jealously watched and guarded against everything and everybody, and has to hear misplaced and exaggerated praises of himself, and censures equally inappropriate, which are intolerable when the man is sober, and, besides being intolerable, are published all over the world in all their indelicacy and wearisomeness when he is drunk.</p>\n\n<p>And not only while his love continues is he mischievous and unpleasant, but when his love ceases he becomes a perfidious <em>(deceitful and untrustworthy)</em> enemy of him on whom he showered his oaths and prayers and promises, and yet could hardly prevail upon him to tolerate the tedium of his company even from motives of interest.</p>\n\n<p>The hour of payment arrives, and now he is the servant of another master; instead of love and infatuation, wisdom and temperance are his bosom&#39;s lords <em>(Romeo&#39;s&nbsp;metaphor for heart)</em>; but the beloved has not discovered the change which has taken place in him, when he asks for a return and recalls to his recollection former sayings and doings; he believes himself to be speaking to the same person, and the other, not having the courage to confess the truth, and not knowing how to fulfil the oaths and promises which he made when under the dominion <em>(the territory of a sovereign or government)</em> of folly <em>(lack of good sense; foolishness)</em>, and having now grown wise and temperate, does not want to do as he did or to be as he was before.</p>\n\n<p>And so he runs away and is constrained to be a defaulter; the oyster-shell (In allusion to a game in which two parties fled or pursued according as an oyster-shell which was thrown into the air fell with the dark or light side uppermost.) has fallen with the other side uppermost&mdash;he changes pursuit into flight, while the other is compelled to follow him with passion and imprecation <em>(a spoken curse)</em>, not knowing that he ought never from the first to have accepted a demented lover instead of a sensible non-lover; and that in making such a choice he was giving himself up to a faithless, morose, envious, disagreeable being, hurtful to his estate, hurtful to his bodily health, and still more hurtful to the cultivation of his mind, than which there neither is nor ever will be anything more honoured in the eyes both of gods and men. Consider this, fair youth, and know that <span style=\"color:#8e44ad;\">in the friendship of the lover there is no real kindness; he has an appetite and wants to feed upon you: &#39;As wolves love lambs so lovers love their loves.&#39;</span></p>\n\n<p>SOCRATES: But that was not acknowledged by Lysias in his speech, nor by you in that other speech which you by a charm drew from my lips. For if love be, as he surely is, a divinity, he cannot be evil. Yet this was the error of both the speeches. There was also a simplicity about them which was refreshing; having no truth or honesty in them, nevertheless they pretended to be something, hoping to succeed in deceiving the manikins of earth and gain celebrity among them.</p>\n\n<p>SOCRATES: Only think, my good Phaedrus, what an utter want of delicacy was shown in the two discourses; I mean, in my own and in that which you recited out of the book. Would not any one who was himself of a noble and gentle nature, and who loved or ever had loved a nature like his own, when we tell of the petty causes of lovers&#39; jealousies, and of their exceeding animosities, and of the injuries which they do to their beloved, have imagined that our ideas of love were taken from some haunt of sailors to which good manners were unknown&mdash;he would certainly never have admitted the justice of our censure?</p>\n\n<p>... And we, on our part, will prove in answer to him that the madness of love is the greatest of heaven&#39;s blessings, and the proof shall be one which the wise will receive, and the witling disbelieve.</p>\n\n<p>The soul through all her being is immortal, for that which is ever in motion is immortal; but that which moves another and is moved by another, in ceasing to move ceases also to live. Only the self-moving, never leaving self, never ceases to move, and is the fountain and beginning of motion to all that moves besides.</p>\n\n<p>Now, the beginning is unbegotten <em>(beget = cause, bring about)</em>, for that which is begotten has a beginning; but the beginning is begotten of nothing, for if it were begotten of something, then the begotten would not come from a beginning. But if unbegotten, it must also be indestructible; for if beginning were destroyed, there could be no beginning out of anything, nor anything out of a beginning; and all things must have a beginning. <span style=\"color:#8e44ad;\"><em>[REALLY?]</em></span></p>\n\n<p><strong><span style=\"color:#8e44ad;\">And therefore the self-moving is the beginning of motion; and this can neither be destroyed nor begotten, else the whole heavens and all creation would collapse and stand still, and never again have motion or birth.</span></strong></p>\n\n<p>But if the self-moving is proved to be immortal, he who affirms that self-motion is the very idea and essence of the soul will not be put to confusion. For the body which is moved from without is soulless; but that which is moved from within has a soul, for such is the nature of the soul. But if this be true, must not the soul be the self-moving, and therefore of necessity unbegotten and immortal? Enough of the soul&#39;s immortality.</p>\n\n<p>Of the nature of the soul, though her true form be ever a theme of large and more than mortal discourse, let me speak briefly, and in a figure. And let the figure be composite&mdash;a pair of winged horses and a charioteer.</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#8e44ad;\">Now the winged horses and the charioteers of the gods are all of them noble and of noble descent, but those of other races are mixed; the human charioteer drives his in a pair; and one of them is noble and of noble breed, and the other is ignoble and of ignoble breed</span>; and the driving of them of necessity gives a great deal of trouble to him. I will endeavour to explain to you in what way the mortal differs from the immortal creature.</p>\n\n<p>The soul in her totality has the care of inanimate being everywhere, and traverses the whole heaven in diverse forms appearing&mdash;when perfect and fully winged she soars <em>(fly or rise)</em> upward, and orders the whole world; whereas the imperfect soul, losing her wings and drooping in her flight at last settles on the solid ground&mdash;there, finding a home, she receives an earthly frame which appears to be self-moved, but is really moved by her power; <strong>and this composition of soul and body is called a living and mortal creature</strong>.</p>\n\n<p>For immortal no such union can be reasonably believed to be; although fancy, not having seen nor surely known the nature of God, may imagine an immortal creature having both a body and also a soul which are united throughout all time. Let that, however, be as God wills, and be spoken of acceptably to him. And now let us ask the reason why the soul loses her wings!</p>\n\n<p>The wing is the corporeal <em>(bodily)</em> element which is most akin to the divine, and which by nature tends to soar aloft <em>(overhead, into the air)</em> and carry that which gravitates downwards into the upper region, which is the habitation of the gods.</p>\n\n<p>The divine is beauty, wisdom, goodness, and the like; and by these the wing of the soul is nourished, and grows apace <em>(swiftly)</em>; but when fed upon evil and foulness and the opposite of good, wastes and falls away.</p>\n\n<p>Zeus, the mighty lord, holding the reins of a winged chariot, leads the way in heaven, ordering all and taking care of all; and there follows him the array of gods and demi-gods, marshalled in eleven bands; Hestia alone abides at home in the house of heaven; of the rest they who are reckoned among the princely twelve march in their appointed order.</p>\n\n<p>They see many blessed sights in the inner heaven, and there are many ways to and fro, along which the blessed gods are passing, every one doing his own work; he may follow who will and can, for jealousy has no place in the celestial choir. But when they go to banquet and festival, then they move up the steep to the top of the vault of heaven.</p>\n\n<p>The chariots of the gods in even poise, obeying the rein, glide rapidly; but the others labour, for the vicious steed <em>(horse)</em> goes heavily, weighing down the charioteer to the earth when his steed has not been thoroughly trained:&mdash;and this is the hour of agony and extremest conflict for the soul. For the immortals, when they are at the end of their course, go forth and stand upon the outside of heaven, and the revolution of the spheres carries them round, and they behold the things beyond.</p>\n\n<p>But of the heaven which is above the heavens, what earthly poet ever did or ever will sing worthily? It is such as I will describe; for I must dare to speak the truth, when truth is my theme.</p>\n\n<p>There abides the very being with which true knowledge is concerned; the colourless, formless, intangible essence, visible only to mind, the pilot of the soul. The divine intelligence, being nurtured upon mind and pure knowledge, and the intelligence of every soul which is capable of receiving the food proper to it, rejoices at beholding reality, and once more gazing upon truth, is replenished <em>(filled up again)</em> and made glad, until the revolution of the worlds brings her round again to the same place.</p>\n\n<p>In the revolution she beholds justice, and temperance, and knowledge absolute, not in the form of generation or of relation, which men call existence, but knowledge absolute in existence absolute; and beholding the other true existences in like manner, and feasting upon them, she passes down into the interior of the heavens and returns home; and there the charioteer putting up his horses at the stall, gives them ambrosia to eat and nectar to drink.</p>\n\n<p>Such is the life of the gods; but of other souls, that which follows God best and is likest to him lifts the head of the charioteer into the outer world, and is carried round in the revolution, troubled indeed by the steeds, and with difficulty beholding true being; while another only rises and falls, and sees, and again fails to see by reason of the unruliness of the steeds.</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#8e44ad;\">The rest of the souls are also longing after the upper world and they all follow, but not being strong enough they are carried round below the surface, plunging, treading on one another, each striving to be first; and there is confusion and perspiration and the extremity of effort; and many of them are lamed or have their wings broken through the ill-driving of the charioteers; and all of them after a fruitless toil, not having attained to the mysteries of true being, go away, and feed upon <strong>opinion</strong>.</span></p>\n\n<p>The reason why the souls exhibit this exceeding eagerness to behold the plain of truth is that pasturage <em>(where horses can feed)</em> is found there, which is suited to the highest part of the soul; and the wing on which the soul soars is nourished with this. And there is a law of Destiny, that the soul which attains any vision of truth in company with a god is preserved from harm until the next period, and if attaining always is always unharmed.</p>\n\n<p>But when she is unable to follow, and fails to behold the truth, and through some ill-hap <em>(mishappening)</em> <span style=\"color:#8e44ad;\">sinks beneath the double load of forgetfulness and vice</span>, and her wings fall from her and she drops to the ground, then the law ordains that this soul shall at her first birth pass, not into any other animal, but only into man; and the soul which has seen <span style=\"color:#8e44ad;\">most of truth shall come to the birth as a philosopher, or artist, or some musical and loving nature</span>; that which has seen truth in the second degree shall be some righteous <span style=\"color:#8e44ad;\">king or warrior chief</span>; the soul which is of the third class shall be <span style=\"color:#8e44ad;\">a politician, or economist, or trader</span>; the fourth shall be a <span style=\"color:#8e44ad;\">lover of gymnastic toils, or a physician</span>; the fifth shall lead the life of a prophet or hierophant <em>(<span jsslot=\"\"><span>a person, especially a priest, who interprets sacred mysteries or esoteric principles</span></span>)</em>; to the sixth the character of <span style=\"color:#8e44ad;\">poet or some other imitative artist</span> will be assigned; to the seventh the life of an <span style=\"color:#8e44ad;\">artisan or husbandman</span>; to the eighth that of a <span style=\"color:#8e44ad;\">sophist or demagogue</span>; to the ninth that of <span style=\"color:#8e44ad;\">a tyrant</span>&mdash;all these are states of probation, in which he who does righteously improves, and he who does unrighteously, deteriorates his lot.</p>\n\n<p>Ten thousand years must elapse before the soul of each one can return to the place from whence she came, for she cannot grow her wings in less; only the soul of a philosopher, guileless <em>(<span jsslot=\"\"><span>innocent and without deception</span></span>)</em> and true, or the soul of a lover, who is not devoid of philosophy, may acquire wings in the third of the recurring periods of a thousand years; he is distinguished from the ordinary good man who gains wings in three thousand years:&mdash;<span style=\"color:#8e44ad;\">and they who choose this life three times in succession have wings given them, and go away at the end of three thousand years</span>.</p>\n\n<p>But the others (The philosopher alone is not subject to judgment (krisis), for he has never lost the vision of truth.) receive judgment when they have completed their first life, and after the judgment they go, some of them to the houses of correction which are under the earth, and are punished; others to some place in heaven whither they are lightly borne by justice, and there they live in a manner worthy of the life which they led here when in the form of men.</p>\n\n<p>And at the end of the first thousand years the good souls and also the evil souls both come to draw lots and choose their second life, and they may take any which they please. The soul of a man may pass into the life of a beast, or from the beast return again into the man. But the soul which has never seen the truth will not pass into the human form.</p>\n\n<p>For a man must have intelligence of universals, and be able to proceed from the many particulars of sense to one conception of reason;&mdash;this is the recollection of those things which our soul once saw while following God&mdash;when regardless of that which we now call being she raised her head up towards the true being.</p>\n\n<p>And therefore the mind of the philosopher alone has wings; and this is just, for he is always, according to the measure of his abilities, clinging in recollection to those things in which God abides, and in beholding which He is what He is. <span style=\"color:#8e44ad;\"><strong>And he who employs aright these memories is ever being initiated into perfect mysteries and alone becomes truly perfect</strong></span>. But, as he forgets earthly interests and is rapt in the divine, the vulgar deem him mad, and rebuke him; they do not see that he is inspired.</p>\n\n<p>Thus far I have been speaking of the fourth and last kind of madness, which is imputed <em>(estimated)</em> to him who, when he sees the beauty of earth, is transported with the recollection of the true beauty; he would like to fly away, but he cannot; he is like a bird fluttering and looking upward and careless of the world below; and he is therefore thought to be mad.</p>\n\n<p>And I have shown this of all inspirations to be the noblest and highest and the offspring of the highest to him who has or shares in it, <span style=\"color:#8e44ad;\">and that he who loves the beautiful is called a lover because he partakes of it</span>.</p>\n\n<p>For, as has been already said, <span style=\"color:#8e44ad;\">every soul of man has in the way of nature beheld true being; this was the condition of her passing into the form of man. But all souls do not easily recall the things of the other world; they may have seen them for a short time only, or they may have been unfortunate in their earthly lot, and, having had their hearts turned to unrighteousness through some corrupting influence, they may have lost the memory of the holy things which once they saw.</span></p>\n\n<p>Few only retain an adequate remembrance of them; and they, when they behold here any image of that other world, are rapt in amazement; but they are ignorant of what this rapture means, because they do not clearly perceive.</p>\n\n<p>For there is no light of justice or temperance or any of the higher ideas which are precious to souls in the earthly copies of them: they are seen through a glass dimly; and there are few who, going to the images, behold in them the realities, and these only with difficulty.</p>\n\n<p>There was a time when with the rest of the happy band they saw beauty shining in brightness,&mdash;we philosophers following in the train of Zeus, others in company with other gods; and then we beheld the beatific <em>(<span jsslot=\"\"><span>feeling or expressing blissful happiness</span></span>)</em> vision and were initiated into a mystery which may be truly called most blessed, celebrated by us in our state of innocence, before we had any experience of evils to come, when we were admitted to the sight of apparitions innocent and simple and calm and happy, which we beheld shining in pure light, pure ourselves and not yet enshrined in that living tomb which we carry about, now that we are imprisoned in the body, like an oyster in his shell. Let me linger over the memory of scenes which have passed away.</p>\n\n<p>But of beauty, I repeat again that we saw her there shining in company with the celestial forms; and coming to earth we find her here too, shining in clearness through the clearest aperture of sense.</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#8e44ad;\">For sight is the most piercing of our bodily senses; though not by that is wisdom seen; her <em>(soul&#39;s)</em> loveliness would have been transporting if there had been a visible image of her, and the other ideas, if they had visible counterparts, would be equally lovely.</span></p>\n\n<p>But this is the privilege of beauty, that being the loveliest she is also the most palpable <em>(<span jsslot=\"\"><span>so intense as to seem almost tangible</span></span>)</em> to sight. Now he who is not newly initiated or who has become corrupted, does not easily rise out of this world to the sight of true beauty in the other; he looks only at her earthly namesake, and instead of being awed at the sight of her, he is given over to pleasure, and like a brutish beast he rushes on to enjoy and beget; he consorts <em>(<span jsslot=\"\"><span>habitually associate with (someone), typically with the disapproval of others</span></span>)</em> with wantonness <em>(wanton=<span class=\"ILfuVd\"><span class=\"e24Kjd\">a lewd or lascivious person</span></span>)</em>, and is not afraid or ashamed of pursuing pleasure in violation of nature.</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#8e44ad;\">But he whose initiation is recent, and who has been the spectator of many glories in the other world, is amazed when he sees any one having a godlike face or form, which is the expression of divine beauty; and at first a shudder runs through him, and again the old awe steals over him; then looking upon the face of his beloved as of a god he reverences him, and if he were not afraid of being thought a downright madman, he would sacrifice to his beloved as to the image of a god; then while he gazes on him there is a sort of reaction, and the shudder passes into an unusual heat and perspiration; for, as he receives the effluence of beauty through the eyes, the wing moistens and he warms</span>.</p>\n\n<p>And as he warms, the parts out of which the wing grew, and which had been hitherto closed and rigid, and had prevented the wing from shooting forth, are melted, and as nourishment streams upon him, the lower end of the wing begins to swell and grow from the root upwards; and the growth extends under the whole soul&mdash;for once the whole was winged.</p>\n\n<p>During this process the whole soul is all in a state of ebullition <em>(<span jsslot=\"\"><span>the action of bubbling or boiling</span></span>; <span jsslot=\"\"><span>sudden outburst of emotion</span></span>)</em> and effervescence <em>(<span jsslot=\"\"><span>vivacity and enthusiasm</span></span>)</em>,&mdash;which may be compared to the irritation and uneasiness in the gums at the time of cutting teeth,&mdash;bubbles up, and has a feeling of uneasiness and tickling; but when in like manner the soul is beginning to grow wings, <span style=\"color:#8e44ad;\">the beauty of the beloved meets her eye and she receives the sensible warm motion of particles which flow towards her, therefore called emotion (imeros), and is refreshed and warmed by them, and then she ceases from her pain with joy.</span></p>\n\n<p>But when she is parted from her beloved and her moisture fails, then the orifices of the passage out of which the wing shoots dry up and close, and intercept the germ of the wing; which, being shut up with the emotion, throbbing as with the pulsations of an artery, pricks the aperture which is nearest, until at length the entire soul is pierced and maddened and pained, and at the recollection of beauty is again delighted. And from both of them together the soul is oppressed at the strangeness of her condition, and is in a great strait <em>(<span jsslot=\"\"><span>narrow or cramped</span></span> condition)</em> and excitement, and in her madness can neither sleep by night nor abide in her place by day.</p>\n\n<p>And wherever she thinks that she will behold the beautiful one, thither in her desire she runs. And when she has seen him, and bathed herself in the waters of beauty, her constraint is loosened, and she is refreshed, and has no more pangs and pains; and this is the sweetest of all pleasures at the time, and is the reason why the soul of the lover will never forsake <em>(abandon)</em> his beautiful one, whom he esteems above all; he has forgotten mother and brethren and companions, and he thinks nothing of the neglect and loss of his property; the rules and proprieties of life, on which he formerly prided himself, he now despises, and is ready to sleep like a servant, wherever he is allowed, as near as he can to his desired one, who is the object of his worship, and the physician who can alone assuage <em>(alleviate)</em> the greatness of his pain.</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#8e44ad;\">And this state, my dear imaginary youth to whom I am talking, is by men called love</span>, and among the gods has a name at which you, in your simplicity, may be inclined to mock; there are two lines in the apocryphal writings of Homer in which the name occurs. One of them is rather outrageous, and not altogether metrical. They are as follows:</p>\n\n<p>&#39;Mortals call him fluttering love, But the immortals call him winged one, Because the growing of wings (Or, reading pterothoiton, &#39;the movement of wings.&#39;) is a necessity to him.&#39;</p>\n\n<p>You may believe this, but not unless you like. At any rate the loves of lovers and their causes are such as I have described.</p>\n\n<p>Now the lover who is taken to be the attendant of Zeus is better able to bear the winged god, and can endure a heavier burden; but the attendants and companions of Ares, when under the influence of love, if they fancy that they have been at all wronged, are ready to kill and put an end to themselves and their beloved.</p>\n\n<p>And he who follows in the train of any other god, while he is unspoiled and the impression lasts, honours and imitates him, as far as he is able; and after the manner of his God he behaves in his intercourse with his beloved and with the rest of the world during the first period of his earthly existence. <span style=\"color:#8e44ad;\">Every one chooses his love from the ranks of beauty according to his character, and this he makes his god, and fashions and adorns as a sort of image which he is to fall down and worship</span>.</p>\n\n<p>The followers of Zeus desire that their beloved should have a soul like him; and therefore they seek out some one of a philosophical and imperial nature, and when they have found him and loved him, they do all they can to confirm such a nature in him, and if they have no experience of such a disposition hitherto, they learn of any one who can teach them, and themselves follow in the same way.</p>\n\n<p>And they have the less difficulty in finding the nature of their own god in themselves, because they have been compelled to gaze intensely on him; their recollection clings to him, and they become possessed of him, and receive from him their character and disposition, so far as man can participate in God.</p>\n\n<p>The qualities of their god they attribute to the beloved, wherefore they love him all the more, and if, like the Bacchic Nymphs, they draw inspiration from Zeus, they pour out their own fountain upon him, wanting to make him as like as possible to their own god.</p>\n\n<p>But those who are the followers of Here seek a royal love, and when they have found him they do just the same with him; and in like manner the followers of Apollo, and of every other god walking in the ways of their god, seek a love who is to be made like him whom they serve, and when they have found him, they themselves imitate their god, and persuade their love to do the same, and educate him into the manner and nature of the god as far as they each can; for no feelings of envy or jealousy are entertained by them towards their beloved, but they do their utmost to create in him the greatest likeness of themselves and of the god whom they honour.</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#8e44ad;\">Thus fair and blissful to the beloved is the desire of the inspired lover, and the initiation of which I speak into the mysteries of true love, if he be captured by the lover and their purpose is effected.</span> Now the beloved is taken captive in the following manner:&mdash;</p>\n\n<p>As I said at the beginning of this tale, I divided each soul into three&mdash;two horses and a charioteer; and one of the horses was good and the other bad: the division may remain, but I have not yet explained in what the goodness or badness of either consists, and to that I will now proceed.</p>\n\n<p>The right-hand horse is upright and cleanly made; he has a lofty neck and an aquiline <em>(<span jsslot=\"\"><span>hooked or curved like an eagle&#39;s beak</span></span>)</em> nose; his colour is white, and his eyes dark; he is a lover of honour and modesty and temperance, and the follower of true glory; he needs no touch of the whip, but is guided by word and admonition only.</p>\n\n<p>The other is a crooked lumbering animal, put together anyhow; he has a short thick neck; he is flat-faced and of a dark colour, with grey eyes and blood-red complexion (Or with grey and blood-shot eyes.); the mate of insolence and pride, shag-eared and deaf, hardly yielding to whip and spur. Now when the charioteer beholds the vision of love, and has his whole soul warmed through sense, and is full of the prickings and ticklings of desire, the obedient steed, then as always under the government of shame, refrains from leaping on the beloved; but the other, heedless of the pricks and of the blows of the whip, plunges and runs away, giving all manner of trouble to his companion and the charioteer, whom he forces to approach the beloved and to remember the joys of love.</p>\n\n<p>They at first indignantly oppose him and will not be urged on to do terrible and unlawful deeds; but at last, when he persists in plaguing them, they yield and agree to do as he bids them. And now they are at the spot and behold the flashing beauty of the beloved; which when the charioteer sees, his memory is carried to the true beauty, whom he beholds in company with Modesty like an image placed upon a holy pedestal.</p>\n\n<p>He sees her, but he is afraid and falls backwards in adoration, and by his fall is compelled to pull back the reins with such violence as to bring both the steeds on their haunches, the one willing and unresisting, the unruly one very unwilling; and when they have gone back a little, the one is overcome with shame and wonder, and his whole soul is bathed in perspiration; the other, when the pain is over which the bridle and the fall had given him, having with difficulty taken breath, is full of wrath and reproaches, which he heaps upon the charioteer and his fellow-steed, for want of courage and manhood, declaring that they have been false to their agreement and guilty of desertion.</p>\n\n<p>Again they refuse, and again he urges them on, and will scarce yield to their prayer that he would wait until another time. When the appointed hour comes, they make as if they had forgotten, and he reminds them, fighting and neighing and dragging them on, until at length he on the same thoughts intent, forces them to draw near again.</p>\n\n<p>And when they are near he stoops his head and puts up his tail, and takes the bit in his teeth and pulls shamelessly. Then the charioteer is worse off than ever; he falls back like a racer at the barrier, and with a still more violent wrench drags the bit out of the teeth of the wild steed and covers his abusive tongue and jaws with blood, and forces his legs and haunches to the ground and punishes him sorely.</p>\n\n<p>And when this has happened several times and the villain has ceased from his wanton way, he is tamed and humbled, and follows the will of the charioteer, and when he sees the beautiful one he is ready to die of fear. And from that time forward the soul of the lover follows the beloved in modesty and holy fear.</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#8e44ad;\">And so the beloved who, like a god, has received every true and loyal service from his lover, not in pretence but in reality, being also himself of a nature friendly to his admirer, if in former days he has blushed to own his passion and turned away his lover, because his youthful companions or others slanderously <em>(<span jsslot=\"\">falsely and maliciously</span>)</em> told him that he would be disgraced, now as years advance, at the appointed age and time, is led to receive him into communion.</span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#8e44ad;\">For fate which has ordained that there shall be no friendship among the evil has also ordained that there shall ever be friendship among the good. And the beloved when he has received him into communion and intimacy, is quite amazed at the good-will of the lover; he recognises that the inspired friend is worth all other friends or kinsmen; they have nothing of friendship in them worthy to be compared with his.</span></p>\n\n<p>And when this feeling continues and he is nearer to him and embraces him, in gymnastic exercises and at other times of meeting, then the fountain of that stream, which Zeus when he was in love with Ganymede named Desire, overflows upon the lover, and some enters into his soul, and some when he is filled flows out again; and as a breeze or an echo rebounds from the smooth rocks and returns whence it came, so does the stream of beauty, passing through the eyes which are the windows of the soul, come back to the beautiful one; there arriving and quickening the passages of the wings, watering them and inclining them to grow, and filling the soul of the beloved also with love.</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#8e44ad;\">And thus he <em>(beloved)</em> loves, but he knows not what; he does not understand and cannot explain his own state; he appears to have caught the infection of blindness from another; the lover is his mirror in whom he is beholding himself, but he is not aware of this.</span></p>\n\n<p>When he is with the lover, both cease from their pain, but when he is away then he longs as he is longed for, and has love&#39;s image, love for love (Anteros) lodging in his breast, which he calls and believes to be not love but friendship only, and his desire is as the desire of the other, but weaker; he wants to see him, touch him, kiss him, embrace him, and probably not long afterwards his desire is accomplished.</p>\n\n<p>When they meet, the wanton steed of the lover has a word to say to the charioteer; he would like to have a little pleasure in return for many pains, but the wanton steed of the beloved says not a word, for he is bursting with passion which he understands not;&mdash;he throws his arms round the lover and embraces him as his dearest friend; and, when they are side by side, he is not in a state in which he can refuse the lover anything, if he ask him; although his fellow-steed and the charioteer oppose him with the arguments of shame and reason.</p>\n\n<p><strong><span style=\"color:#8e44ad;\">After this their happiness depends upon their self-control; if the better elements of the mind which lead to order and philosophy prevail, then they pass their life here in happiness and harmony&mdash;masters of themselves and orderly&mdash;enslaving the vicious and emancipating <em>(<span jsslot=\"\">liberating</span>)</em> the virtuous elements of the soul</span></strong>; and when the end comes, they are light and winged for flight, having conquered in one of the three heavenly or truly Olympian victories; nor can human discipline or divine inspiration confer any greater blessing on man than this. If, on the other hand, they leave philosophy and lead the lower life of ambition, then probably, after wine or in some other careless hour, the two wanton animals take the two souls when off their guard and bring them together, and they accomplish that desire of their hearts which to the many is bliss; and this having once enjoyed they continue to enjoy, yet rarely because they have not the approval of the whole soul.</p>\n\n<p>They too are dear, but not so dear to one another as the others, either at the time of their love or afterwards. They consider that they have given and taken from each other the most sacred pledges, and they may not break them and fall into enmity.</p>\n\n<p>At last they pass out of the body, unwinged, but eager to soar, and thus obtain no mean reward of love and madness.</p>\n\n<p>For those who have once begun the heavenward pilgrimage may not go down again to darkness and the journey beneath the earth, but they live in light always; happy companions in their pilgrimage, and when the time comes at which they receive their wings they have the same plumage because of their love.</p>\n\n<p><strong><span style=\"color:#8e44ad;\">Thus great are the heavenly blessings which the friendship of a lover will confer upon you</span></strong>, my youth. Whereas the attachment of the non-lover, which is alloyed with a worldly prudence and has worldly and niggardly ways of doling <em>(distribute out)</em> out benefits, will breed in your soul those vulgar qualities which the populace applaud, will send you bowling round the earth during a period of nine thousand years, and leave you a fool in the world below.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h2>Symposium</h2>\n\n<p>In this dialog we come to know a common habit of Socrates, which is that he used to get so much absorbed in his thoughts that he did not move for quite some time.</p>\n\n<p>In this dialog people make praise the Love god one by one. Phaedrus begins.</p>\n\n<p>As Hesiod says:&mdash;</p>\n\n<p>&#39;First Chaos came, and then broad-bosomed Earth, The everlasting seat of all that is, And Love.&#39;</p>\n\n<p>In other words, after Chaos, the Earth and Love, these two, came into being. Also Parmenides sings of Generation:</p>\n\n<p>&#39;First in the train of gods, he fashioned Love.&#39;</p>\n\n<p>And not only is he the eldest, he is also the source of the greatest benefits to us. For I know not any greater blessing to a young man who is beginning life than a virtuous lover, or to the lover than a beloved youth.</p>\n\n<p>And I say that a lover who is detected in doing any dishonourable act, or submitting through cowardice when any dishonour is done to him by another, will be more pained at being detected by his beloved than at being seen by his father, or by his companions, or by any one else. The beloved too, when he is found in any disgraceful situation, has the same feeling about his lover. And if there were only some way of contriving that a state or an army should be made up of lovers and their loves (compare Rep.), they would be the very best governors of their own city, abstaining from all dishonour, and emulating one another in honour; and when fighting at each other&#39;s side, although a mere handful, they would overcome the world. For what lover would not choose rather to be seen by all mankind than by his beloved, either when abandoning his post or throwing away his arms? He would be ready to die a thousand deaths rather than endure this. Or who would desert his beloved or fail him in the hour of danger? The veriest coward would become an inspired hero, equal to the bravest, at such a time; Love would inspire him. That courage which, as Homer says, the god breathes into the souls of some heroes, Love of his own nature infuses into the lover.</p>\n\n<p>Love will make men dare to die for their beloved&mdash;love alone; and women as well as men.</p>\n\n<p><em>[He then goes on to justify his statement that Love is the eldest and greatest by referring to Homer&#39;s stories about </em>Alcestis, Achilles<em>]</em></p>\n\n<p><em>[Then other speakers praised Love. Pausanias praised it in the following manner]</em></p>\n\n<p>For we all know that Love is inseparable from Aphrodite, and if there were only one Aphrodite there would be only one Love; but as there are two goddesses there must be two Loves.... [One of the goddesses is called &quot;heavenly&quot; and the other one &quot;common&quot;]</p>\n\n<p>Now actions vary according to the manner of their performance. Take, for example, that which we are now doing, drinking, singing and talking&mdash;these actions are not in themselves either good or evil, but they turn out in this or that way according to the mode of performing them; and when well done they are good, and when wrongly done they are evil; and in like manner not every love, but only that which has a noble purpose, is noble and worthy of praise.</p>\n\n<p>[So, there is common love and heavenly love. The common love is apt for body rather than soul, women, youth.] .. the most foolish beings are the objects of this love which desires only to gain an end, but never thinks of accomplishing the end nobly, and therefore does good and evil quite indiscriminately.</p>\n\n<p>[The heavenly love desires for intelligent beings] .. And in choosing young men to be their companions, they mean to be faithful to them, and pass their whole life in company with them, not to take them in their inexperience, and deceive them, and play the fool with them, or run away from one to another of them.</p>\n\n<p>Such is the entire liberty which gods and men have allowed the lover, according to the custom which prevails in our part of the world. From this point of view a man fairly argues that in Athens to love and to be loved is held to be a very honourable thing.</p>\n\n<p>Evil is the vulgar lover who loves the body rather than the soul, inasmuch as he is not even stable, because he loves a thing which is in itself unstable, and therefore when the bloom of youth which he was desiring is over, he takes wing and flies away, in spite of all his words and promises; whereas the love of the noble disposition is life-long, for it becomes one with the everlasting.&nbsp; The custom of our country would have both of them proven well and truly, and would have us yield to the one sort of lover and avoid the other, and therefore encourages some to pursue, and others to fly; testing both the lover and beloved in contests and trials, until they show to which of the two classes they respectively belong. And this is the reason why, in the first place, a hasty attachment is held to be dishonourable, because time is the true test of this as of most other things; and secondly there is a dishonour in being overcome by the love of money, or of wealth, or of political power, whether a man is frightened into surrender by the loss of them, or, having experienced the benefits of money and political corruption, is unable to rise above the seductions of them. For none of these things are of a permanent or lasting nature; not to mention that no generous friendship ever sprang from them. There remains, then, only one way of honourable attachment which custom allows in the beloved, and this is the way of virtue; for as we admitted that any service which the lover does to him is not to be accounted flattery or a dishonour to himself, so the beloved has one way only of voluntary service which is not dishonourable, and this is virtuous service.</p>\n\n<p>Eryximachus the physician:</p>\n\n<p>... <em>[Eryximachus the idea of two distinctions of love which was mentioned earlier.] </em>But my art further informs me that the double love is not merely an affection of the soul of man towards the fair, or towards anything, but is to be found in the bodies of all animals and in productions of the earth, and I may say in all that is.</p>\n\n<p>... that harmony is composed of differing notes of higher or lower pitch which disagreed once, but are now reconciled by the art of music; for if the higher and lower notes still disagreed, there could be no harmony,&mdash;clearly not. For harmony is a symphony, and symphony is an agreement; but an agreement of disagreements while they disagree there cannot be; you cannot harmonize that which disagrees. In like manner rhythm is compounded of elements short and long, once differing and now in accord; which accordance, as in the former instance, medicine, so in all these other cases, music implants, making love and unison to grow up among them; and thus music, too, is concerned with the principles of love in their application to harmony and rhythm.</p>\n\n<p>Again, in the essential nature of harmony and rhythm there is no difficulty in discerning love which has not yet become double. But when you want to use them in actual life, either in the composition of songs or in the correct performance of airs or metres composed already, which latter is called education, then the difficulty begins, and the good artist is needed.</p>\n\n<p>And the love, more especially, which is concerned with the good, and which is perfected in company with temperance and justice, whether among gods or men, has the greatest power, and is the source of all our happiness and harmony, and makes us friends with the gods who are above us, and with one another.</p>\n\n<p>...</p>\n\n<p>Aristophanes tells a story describing why is that those who have not found love feel that they are lacking something, and those who have found love seem full and complete.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Mankind, he said, judging by their neglect of him, have never, as I think, at all understood the power of Love. For if they had understood him they would surely have built noble temples and altars, and offered solemn sacrifices in his honour; but this is not done, and most certainly ought to be done: since of all the gods he is the best friend of men, the helper and the healer of the ills which are the great impediment to the happiness of the race.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>[See these youtube videos for his story:&nbsp; <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YDvMRvWjI9Q\" target=\"_blank\">The Myth Of Missing Half</a>, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4paSMqKYXtY\" target=\"_blank\">Speech of Aristophanes</a>]</p>\n\n<p>Agathon:</p>\n\n<p>The previous speakers, instead of praising the god Love, or unfolding his nature, appear to have congratulated mankind on the benefits which he confers upon them. But I would rather praise the god first, and then speak of his gifts; this is always the right way of praising everything.</p>\n\n<p>Many things were said by Phaedrus about Love in which I agree with him; but I cannot agree that he is older than Iapetus and Kronos:&mdash;not so; I maintain him to be the youngest of the gods, and youthful ever.</p>\n\n<p>Of a truth he is the tenderest as well as the youngest, and also he is of flexile form; for if he were hard and without flexure he could not enfold all things, or wind his way into and out of every soul of man undiscovered. And a proof of his flexibility and symmetry of form is his grace, which is universally admitted to be in an especial manner the attribute of Love; ungrace and love are always at war with one another. his greatest glory is that he can neither do nor suffer wrong to or from any god or any man; for he suffers not by force if he suffers; force comes not near him, neither when he acts does he act by force.For all men in all things serve him of their own free will, and where there is voluntary agreement, there, as the laws which are the lords of the city say, is justice. And not only is he just but exceedingly temperate, for Temperance is the acknowledged ruler of the pleasures and desires, and no pleasure ever masters Love; he is their master and they are his servants; and if he conquers them he must be temperate indeed.</p>\n\n<p>And if he conquers the bravest of all others, he must be himself the bravest. [Now to his wisdom] In the first place he is a poet and he is also the source of poesy in others, which he could not be if he were not himself a poet. And at the touch of him every one becomes a poet, even though he had no music in him before.</p>\n\n<p>In the days of old, as I began by saying, dreadful deeds were done among the gods, for they were ruled by Necessity; but now since the birth of Love, and from the Love of the beautiful, has sprung every good in heaven and earth. He is said to be the god who</p>\n\n<p>&#39;Gives peace on earth and calms the stormy deep, Who stills the winds and bids the sufferer sleep.&#39;</p>\n\n<p><em>[Socrates appreciates the praises done so far and says that this is not a true praise that he had in mind, they just gathered all possible goodness and attributed it to Love...]</em> Say then, Phaedrus, whether you would like to have the truth about love, spoken in any words and in any order which may happen to come into my mind at the time. Will that be agreeable to you?</p>\n\n<p>[Socrates says let me ask you Agathon] Whether love is the love of something or of nothing? And here I must explain myself: I do not want you to say that love is the love of a father or the love of a mother&mdash;that would be ridiculous; but to answer as you would, if I asked is a father a father of something? to which you would find no difficulty in replying, of a son or daughter: and the answer would be right. [And same for mother, brother]</p>\n\n<p>Very true, said Agathon.</p>\n\n<p>Is Love of something or of nothing? - Of something, surely, he replied.</p>\n\n<p>Keep in mind what this is, and tell me what I want to know&mdash;whether Love desires that of which love is. - Yes, surely.</p>\n\n<p>And does he possess, or does he not possess, that which he loves and desires? - Probably not, I should say.</p>\n\n<p>Nay, replied Socrates, I would have you consider whether &#39;necessarily&#39; is not rather the word. The inference that he who desires something is in want of something, and that he who desires nothing is in want of nothing, is in my judgment, Agathon, absolutely and necessarily true. What do you think?</p>\n\n<p>I agree with you, said Agathon.</p>\n\n<p>Would he who is great, desire to be great, or he who is strong, desire to be strong?</p>\n\n<p>That would be inconsistent with our previous admissions. <em>[Why? The rich desire to <strong>be</strong> rich, maybe even richer. Also, the strong would desire to <strong>remain</strong> strong at least.]</em></p>\n\n<p>True. For he who is anything cannot want to be that which he is?</p>\n\n<p>Therefore, when a person says, I am well and wish to be well, or I am rich and wish to be rich, and I desire simply to have what I have&mdash;to him we shall reply: &#39;You, my friend, having wealth and health and strength, want to have the continuance of them; for at this moment, whether you choose or no, you have them. And when you say, I desire that which I have and nothing else, is not your meaning that you want to have what you now have in the future?&#39; He must agree with us&mdash;must he not? - He must.</p>\n\n<p>Then, said Socrates, he desires that what he has at present may be preserved to him in the future, which is equivalent to saying that he desires something which is non-existent to him, and which as yet he has not got: Then he and every one who desires, desires that which he has not already, and which is future and not present, and which he has not, and is not, and of which he is in want;&mdash;these are the sort of things which love and desire seek?</p>\n\n<p>Then now, said Socrates, let us recapitulate the argument. First, is not love of something, and of something too which is wanting to a man?</p>\n\n<p>Remember further what you said in your speech, or if you do not remember I will remind you: you said that the love of the beautiful set in order the empire of the gods, for that of deformed things there is no love&mdash;did you not say something of that kind?</p>\n\n<p>Yes, said Agathon.</p>\n\n<p>Yes, my friend, and the remark was a just one. And if this is true, Love is the love of beauty and not of deformity? - Yes.</p>\n\n<p>And the admission has been already made that Love is of something which a man wants and has not? Then Love wants and has not beauty? - Certainly.</p>\n\n<p>And would you call that beautiful which wants and does not possess beauty? - No. Then would you still say that love is beautiful?</p>\n\n<p>Agathon replied: I fear that I did not understand what I was saying.</p>\n\n<p>You made a very good speech, Agathon, replied Socrates; but there is yet one small question which I would fain ask:&mdash;Is not the good also the beautiful? - Yes.</p>\n\n<p>Then in wanting the beautiful, love wants also the good?</p>\n\n<p>I cannot refute you, Socrates, said Agathon:&mdash;Let us assume that what you say is true.</p>\n\n<p>Say rather, beloved Agathon, that you cannot refute the truth; for Socrates is easily refuted.</p>\n\n<p>[Socrates then tells a tale from Diotima who was his instructress in the art of love..] I think that this will be the easiest way, and I shall take both parts myself as well as I can. As you, Agathon, suggested (supra), I must speak first of the being and nature of Love, and then of his works. First I said to her in nearly the same words which he used to me, that Love was a mighty god, and likewise fair; and she proved to me as I proved to him that, by my own showing, Love was neither fair nor good.</p>\n\n<p>&#39;What do you mean, Diotima,&#39; I said, &#39;is love then evil and foul?&#39;</p>\n\n<p>&#39;Hush,&#39; she cried; &#39;must that be foul which is not fair?&#39;</p>\n\n<p>&#39;Certainly,&#39; I said.</p>\n\n<p>&#39;And is that which is not wise, ignorant? do you not see that there is a mean between wisdom and ignorance?&#39;</p>\n\n<p>&#39;And what may that be?&#39; I said.</p>\n\n<p>&#39;Right opinion,&#39; she replied; &#39;which, as you know, being incapable of giving a reason, is not knowledge (for how can knowledge be devoid of reason? nor again, ignorance, for neither can ignorance attain the truth), but is clearly something which is a mean between ignorance and wisdom.&#39;</p>\n\n<p>&#39;Quite true,&#39; I replied.</p>\n\n<p>&#39;Do not then insist,&#39; she said, &#39;that what is not fair is of necessity foul, or what is not good evil; or infer that because love is not fair and good he is therefore foul and evil; for he is in a mean between them.&#39;</p>\n\n<p>&#39;Well,&#39; I said, &#39;Love is surely admitted by all to be a great god.&#39;</p>\n\n<p>&#39;By those who know or by those who do not know?&#39;</p>\n\n<p>&#39;By all.&#39;</p>\n\n<p>&#39;And how, Socrates,&#39; she said with a smile, &#39;can Love be acknowledged to be a great god by those who say that he is not a god at all?&#39;</p>\n\n<p>&#39;And who are they?&#39; I said.</p>\n\n<p>&#39;You and I are two of them,&#39; she replied.</p>\n\n<p>&#39;How can that be?&#39; I said.</p>\n\n<p>&#39;It is quite intelligible,&#39; she replied; &#39;for you yourself would acknowledge that the gods are happy and fair&mdash;of course you would&mdash;would you dare to say that any god was not?&#39;</p>\n\n<p>&#39;Certainly not,&#39; I replied.</p>\n\n<p>&#39;And you mean by the happy, those who are the possessors of things good or fair?&#39;</p>\n\n<p>&#39;Yes.&#39;</p>\n\n<p>&#39;And you admitted that Love, because he was in want, desires those good and fair things of which he is in want?&#39;</p>\n\n<p>&#39;Yes, I did.&#39;</p>\n\n<p>&#39;But how can he be a god who has no portion in what is either good or fair?&#39;</p>\n\n<p>&#39;Impossible.&#39;</p>\n\n<p>&#39;Then you see that you also deny the divinity of Love.&#39;</p>\n\n<p>&#39;What then is Love?&#39; I asked; &#39;Is he mortal?&#39;</p>\n\n<p>&#39;No.&#39;</p>\n\n<p>&#39;What then?&#39;</p>\n\n<p>&#39;As in the former instance, he is neither mortal nor immortal, but in a mean between the two.&#39;</p>\n\n<p>&#39;What is he, Diotima?&#39;</p>\n\n<p>&#39;He is a great spirit (daimon), and like all spirits he is intermediate between the divine and the mortal.&#39;</p>\n\n<p>&#39;And what,&#39; I said, &#39;is his power?&#39; &#39;He interprets,&#39; she replied, &#39;between gods and men, conveying and taking across to the gods the prayers and sacrifices of men, and to men the commands and replies of the gods; he is the mediator who spans the chasm which divides them, and therefore in him all is bound together, and through him the arts of the prophet and the priest, their sacrifices and mysteries and charms, and all prophecy and incantation, find their way. For God mingles not with man; but through Love all the intercourse and converse of God with man, whether awake or asleep, is carried on. The wisdom which understands this is spiritual; all other wisdom, such as that of arts and handicrafts, is mean and vulgar. Now these spirits or intermediate powers are many and diverse, and one of them is Love.&#39;</p>\n\n<p>&#39;And who,&#39; I said, &#39;was his father, and who his mother?&#39;</p>\n\n<p>&#39;The tale,&#39; she said, &#39;will take time; nevertheless I will tell you. On the birthday of Aphrodite there was a feast of the gods, at which the god Poros or Plenty, who is the son of Metis or Discretion, was one of the guests. When the feast was over, Penia or Poverty, as the manner is on such occasions, came about the doors to beg. Now Plenty who was the worse for nectar (there was no wine in those days), went into the garden of Zeus and fell into a heavy sleep, and Poverty considering her own straitened circumstances, plotted to have a child by him, and accordingly she lay down at his side and conceived Love, who partly because he is naturally a lover of the beautiful, and because Aphrodite is herself beautiful, and also because he was born on her birthday, is her follower and attendant. And as his parentage is, so also are his fortunes. In the first place he is always poor, and anything but tender and fair, as the many imagine him; and he is rough and squalid, and has no shoes, nor a house to dwell in; on the bare earth exposed he lies under the open heaven, in the streets, or at the doors of houses, taking his rest; and like his mother he is always in distress. Like his father too, whom he also partly resembles, he is always plotting against the fair and good; he is bold, enterprising, strong, a mighty hunter, always weaving some intrigue or other, keen in the pursuit of wisdom, fertile in resources; a philosopher at all times, terrible as an enchanter, sorcerer, sophist. He is by nature neither mortal nor immortal, but alive and flourishing at one moment when he is in plenty, and dead at another moment, and again alive by reason of his father&#39;s nature. But that which is always flowing in is always flowing out, and so he is never in want and never in wealth; and, further, he is in a mean between ignorance and knowledge. The truth of the matter is this: No god is a philosopher or seeker after wisdom, for he is wise already; nor does any man who is wise seek after wisdom. Neither do the ignorant seek after wisdom. For herein is the evil of ignorance, that he who is neither good nor wise is nevertheless satisfied with himself: he has no desire for that of which he feels no want.&#39;</p>\n\n<p>&#39;But who then, Diotima,&#39; I said, &#39;are the lovers of wisdom, if they are neither the wise nor the foolish?&#39;</p>\n\n<p>&#39;A child may answer that question,&#39; she replied; &#39;they are those who are in a mean between the two; Love is one of them. For wisdom is a most beautiful thing, and Love is of the beautiful; and therefore Love is also a philosopher or lover of wisdom, and being a lover of wisdom is in a mean between the wise and the ignorant. And of this too his birth is the cause; for his father is wealthy and wise, and his mother poor and foolish. Such, my dear Socrates, is the nature of the spirit Love. The error in your conception of him was very natural, and as I imagine from what you say, has arisen out of a confusion of love and the beloved, which made you think that love was all beautiful. For the beloved is the truly beautiful, and delicate, and perfect, and blessed; but the principle of love is of another nature, and is such as I have described.&#39;</p>\n\n<p>I said, &#39;O thou stranger woman, thou sayest well; but, assuming Love to be such as you say, what is the use of him to men?&#39;</p>\n\n<p>&#39;That, Socrates,&#39; she replied, &#39;I will attempt to unfold: of his nature and birth I have already spoken; and you acknowledge that love is of the beautiful. But some one will say: Of the beautiful in what, Socrates and Diotima?&mdash;or rather let me put the question more clearly, and ask: When a man loves the beautiful, what does he desire?&#39;</p>\n\n<p>I answered her &#39;That the beautiful may be his.&#39;</p>\n\n<p>&#39;Still,&#39; she said, &#39;the answer suggests a further question: What is given by the possession of beauty?&#39;</p>\n\n<p>&#39;To what you have asked,&#39; I replied, &#39;I have no answer ready.&#39;</p>\n\n<p>&#39;Then,&#39; she said, &#39;let me put the word &quot;good&quot; in the place of the beautiful, and repeat the question once more: If he who loves loves the good, what is it then that he loves?&#39;</p>\n\n<p>&#39;The possession of the good,&#39; I said. &#39;And what does he gain who possesses the good?&#39;</p>\n\n<p>&#39;Happiness,&#39; I replied; &#39;there is less difficulty in answering that question.&#39;</p>\n\n<p>&#39;Yes,&#39; she said, &#39;the happy are made happy by the acquisition of good things. Nor is there any need to ask why a man desires happiness; the answer is already final.&#39;</p>\n\n<p>&#39;You are right.&#39; I said. &#39;And is this wish and this desire common to all? and do all men always desire their own good, or only some men?&mdash;what say you?&#39;</p>\n\n<p>&#39;All men,&#39; I replied; &#39;the desire is common to all.&#39;</p>\n\n<p>&#39;Why, then,&#39; she rejoined, &#39;are not all men, Socrates, said to love, but only some of them? whereas you say that all men are always loving the same things.&#39;</p>\n\n<p>&#39;I myself wonder,&#39; I said, &#39;why this is.&#39;</p>\n\n<p>&#39;There is nothing to wonder at,&#39; she replied; &#39;the reason is that one part of love is separated off and receives the name of the whole, but the other parts have other names.&#39;</p>\n\n<p>&#39;Give an illustration,&#39; I said.</p>\n\n<p>She answered me as follows: &#39;There is poetry, which, as you know, is complex and manifold. All creation or passage of non-being into being is poetry or making, and the processes of all art are creative; and the masters of arts are all poets or makers.&#39;</p>\n\n<p>&#39;Very true.&#39;</p>\n\n<p>&#39;Still,&#39; she said, &#39;you know that they are not called poets, but have other names; only that portion of the art which is separated off from the rest, and is concerned with music and metre, is termed poetry, and they who possess poetry in this sense of the word are called poets.&#39;</p>\n\n<p>&#39;Very true,&#39; I said.</p>\n\n<p>&#39;And the same holds of love. For you may say generally that all desire of good and happiness is only the great and subtle power of love; but they who are drawn towards him by any other path, whether the path of money-making or gymnastics or philosophy, are not called lovers&mdash;the name of the whole is appropriated to those whose affection takes one form only&mdash;they alone are said to love, or to be lovers.&#39;</p>\n\n<p>&#39;I dare say,&#39; I replied, &#39;that you are right.&#39;</p>\n\n<p>&#39;Yes,&#39; she added, &#39;and you hear people say that lovers are seeking for their other half; but I say that they are seeking neither for the half of themselves, nor for the whole, unless the half or the whole be also a good. And they will cut off their own hands and feet and cast them away, if they are evil; for they love not what is their own, unless perchance there be some one who calls what belongs to him the good, and what belongs to another the evil. For there is nothing which men love but the good. Is there anything?&#39;</p>\n\n<p>&#39;Certainly, I should say, that there is nothing.&#39;</p>\n\n<p>&#39;Then,&#39; she said, &#39;the simple truth is, that men love the good.&#39;</p>\n\n<p>&#39;Yes,&#39; I said.</p>\n\n<p>&#39;To which must be added that they love the possession of the good?&#39;</p>\n\n<p>&#39;Yes, that must be added.&#39;</p>\n\n<p>&#39;And not only the possession, but the everlasting possession of the good?&#39;</p>\n\n<p>&#39;That must be added too.&#39;</p>\n\n<p>&#39;Then love,&#39; she said, &#39;may be described generally as the love of the everlasting possession of the good?&#39;</p>\n\n<p>&#39;That is most true.&#39;</p>\n\n<p>&#39;Then if this be the nature of love, can you tell me further,&#39; she said, &#39;what is the manner of the pursuit? what are they doing who show all this eagerness and heat which is called love? and what is the object which they have in view? Answer me.&#39;</p>\n\n<p>&#39;Nay, Diotima,&#39; I replied, &#39;if I had known, I should not have wondered at your wisdom, neither should I have come to learn from you about this very matter.&#39;</p>\n\n<p>&#39;Well,&#39; she said, &#39;I will teach you:&mdash;The object which they have in view is birth in beauty, whether of body or soul.&#39;</p>\n\n<p>&#39;I do not understand you,&#39; I said; &#39;the oracle requires an explanation.&#39;</p>\n\n<p>&#39;I will make my meaning clearer,&#39; she replied. &#39;I mean to say, that all men are bringing to the birth in their bodies and in their souls. There is a certain age at which human nature is desirous of procreation&mdash;procreation which must be in beauty and not in deformity; and this procreation is the union of man and woman, and is a divine thing; for conception and generation are an immortal principle in the mortal creature, and in the inharmonious they can never be. But the deformed is always inharmonious with the divine, and the beautiful harmonious. Beauty, then, is the destiny or goddess of parturition who presides at birth, and therefore, when approaching beauty, the conceiving power is propitious, and diffusive, and benign, and begets and bears fruit: at the sight of ugliness she frowns and contracts and has a sense of pain, and turns away, and shrivels up, and not without a pang refrains from conception. And this is the reason why, when the hour of conception arrives, and the teeming nature is full, there is such a flutter and ecstasy about beauty whose approach is the alleviation of the pain of travail. For love, Socrates, is not, as you imagine, the love of the beautiful only.&#39;</p>\n\n<p>&#39;What then?&#39;</p>\n\n<p>&#39;The love of generation and of birth in beauty.&#39;</p>\n\n<p>&#39;Yes,&#39; I said.</p>\n\n<p>&#39;Yes, indeed,&#39; she replied.</p>\n\n<p>&#39;But why of generation?&#39;</p>\n\n<p>&#39;Because to the mortal creature, generation is a sort of eternity and immortality,&#39; she replied; &#39;and if, as has been already admitted, love is of the everlasting possession of the good, all men will necessarily desire immortality together with good: Wherefore love is of immortality.&#39;</p>\n\n<p>All this she taught me at various times when she spoke of love. And I remember her once saying to me, &#39;What is the cause, Socrates, of love, and the attendant desire? See you not how all animals, birds, as well as beasts, in their desire of procreation, are in agony when they take the infection of love, which begins with the desire of union; whereto is added the care of offspring, on whose behalf the weakest are ready to battle against the strongest even to the uttermost, and to die for them, and will let themselves be tormented with hunger or suffer anything in order to maintain their young. Man may be supposed to act thus from reason; but why should animals have these passionate feelings? Can you tell me why?&#39;</p>\n\n<p>Again I replied that I did not know. She said to me: &#39;And do you expect ever to become a master in the art of love, if you do not know this?&#39;</p>\n\n<p>&#39;But I have told you already, Diotima, that my ignorance is the reason why I come to you; for I am conscious that I want a teacher; tell me then the cause of this and of the other mysteries of love.&#39;</p>\n\n<p>&#39;Marvel not,&#39; she said, &#39;if you believe that love is of the immortal, as we have several times acknowledged; for here again, and on the same principle too, the mortal nature is seeking as far as is possible to be everlasting and immortal: and this is only to be attained by generation, because generation always leaves behind a new existence in the place of the old. Nay even in the life of the same individual there is succession and not absolute unity: a man is called the same, and yet in the short interval which elapses between youth and age, and in which every animal is said to have life and identity, he is undergoing a perpetual process of loss and reparation&mdash;hair, flesh, bones, blood, and the whole body are always changing. Which is true not only of the body, but also of the soul, whose habits, tempers, opinions, desires, pleasures, pains, fears, never remain the same in any one of us, but are always coming and going; and equally true of knowledge, and what is still more surprising to us mortals, not only do the sciences in general spring up and decay, so that in respect of them we are never the same; but each of them individually experiences a like change. For what is implied in the word &quot;recollection,&quot; but the departure of knowledge, which is ever being forgotten, and is renewed and preserved by recollection, and appears to be the same although in reality new, according to that law of succession by which all mortal things are preserved, not absolutely the same, but by substitution, the old worn-out mortality leaving another new and similar existence behind&mdash;unlike the divine, which is always the same and not another? And in this way, Socrates, the mortal body, or mortal anything, partakes of immortality; but the immortal in another way. Marvel not then at the love which all men have of their offspring; for that universal love and interest is for the sake of immortality.&#39;</p>\n\n<p>I was astonished at her words, and said: &#39;Is this really true, O thou wise Diotima?&#39;</p>\n\n<p>And she answered with all the authority of an accomplished sophist: &#39;Of that, Socrates, you may be assured;&mdash;think only of the ambition of men, and you will wonder at the senselessness of their ways, unless you consider how they are stirred by the love of an immortality of fame. They are ready to run all risks greater far than they would have run for their children, and to spend money and undergo any sort of toil, and even to die, for the sake of leaving behind them a name which shall be eternal. Do you imagine that Alcestis would have died to save Admetus, or Achilles to avenge Patroclus, or your own Codrus in order to preserve the kingdom for his sons, if they had not imagined that the memory of their virtues, which still survives among us, would be immortal? Nay,&#39; she said, &#39;I am persuaded that all men do all things, and the better they are the more they do them, in hope of the glorious fame of immortal virtue; for they desire the immortal.</p>\n\n<p>&#39;Those who are pregnant in the body only, betake themselves to women and beget children&mdash;this is the character of their love; their offspring, as they hope, will preserve their memory and giving them the blessedness and immortality which they desire in the future. But souls which are pregnant&mdash;for there certainly are men who are more creative in their souls than in their bodies&mdash;conceive that which is proper for the soul to conceive or contain. And what are these conceptions?&mdash;wisdom and virtue in general. And such creators are poets and all artists who are deserving of the name inventor. But the greatest and fairest sort of wisdom by far is that which is concerned with the ordering of states and families, and which is called temperance and justice. And he who in youth has the seed of these implanted in him and is himself inspired, when he comes to maturity desires to beget and generate. He wanders about seeking beauty that he may beget offspring&mdash;for in deformity he will beget nothing&mdash;and naturally embraces the beautiful rather than the deformed body; above all when he finds a fair and noble and well-nurtured soul, he embraces the two in one person, and to such an one he is full of speech about virtue and the nature and pursuits of a good man; and he tries to educate him; and at the touch of the beautiful which is ever present to his memory, even when absent, he brings forth that which he had conceived long before, and in company with him tends that which he brings forth; and they are married by a far nearer tie and have a closer friendship than those who beget mortal children, for the children who are their common offspring are fairer and more immortal. Who, when he thinks of Homer and Hesiod and other great poets, would not rather have their children than ordinary human ones? Who would not emulate them in the creation of children such as theirs, which have preserved their memory and given them everlasting glory? Or who would not have such children as Lycurgus left behind him to be the saviours, not only of Lacedaemon, but of Hellas, as one may say? There is Solon, too, who is the revered father of Athenian laws; and many others there are in many other places, both among Hellenes and barbarians, who have given to the world many noble works, and have been the parents of virtue of every kind; and many temples have been raised in their honour for the sake of children such as theirs; which were never raised in honour of any one, for the sake of his mortal children.</p>\n\n<p>&#39;These are the lesser mysteries of love, into which even you, Socrates, may enter; to the greater and more hidden ones which are the crown of these, and to which, if you pursue them in a right spirit, they will lead, I know not whether you will be able to attain. But I will do my utmost to inform you, and do you follow if you can. For he who would proceed aright in this matter should begin in youth to visit beautiful forms; and first, if he be guided by his instructor aright, to love one such form only&mdash;out of that he should create fair thoughts; and soon he will of himself perceive that the beauty of one form is akin to the beauty of another; and then if beauty of form in general is his pursuit, how foolish would he be not to recognize that the beauty in every form is and the same! And when he perceives this he will abate his violent love of the one, which he will despise and deem a small thing, and will become a lover of all beautiful forms; in the next stage he will consider that the beauty of the mind is more honourable than the beauty of the outward form. So that if a virtuous soul have but a little comeliness, he will be content to love and tend him, and will search out and bring to the birth thoughts which may improve the young, until he is compelled to contemplate and see the beauty of institutions and laws, and to understand that the beauty of them all is of one family, and that personal beauty is a trifle; and after laws and institutions he will go on to the sciences, that he may see their beauty, being not like a servant in love with the beauty of one youth or man or institution, himself a slave mean and narrow-minded, but drawing towards and contemplating the vast sea of beauty, he will create many fair and noble thoughts and notions in boundless love of wisdom; until on that shore he grows and waxes strong, and at last the vision is revealed to him of a single science, which is the science of beauty everywhere. To this I will proceed; please to give me your very best attention:</p>\n\n<p>&#39;He who has been instructed thus far in the things of love, and who has learned to see the beautiful in due order and succession, when he comes toward the end will suddenly perceive a nature of wondrous beauty (and this, Socrates, is the final cause of all our former toils)&mdash;a nature which in the first place is everlasting, not growing and decaying, or waxing and waning; secondly, not fair in one point of view and foul in another, or at one time or in one relation or at one place fair, at another time or in another relation or at another place foul, as if fair to some and foul to others, or in the likeness of a face or hands or any other part of the bodily frame, or in any form of speech or knowledge, or existing in any other being, as for example, in an animal, or in heaven, or in earth, or in any other place; but beauty absolute, separate, simple, and everlasting, which without diminution and without increase, or any change, is imparted to the ever-growing and perishing beauties of all other things. He who from these ascending under the influence of true love, begins to perceive that beauty, is not far from the end. And the true order of going, or being led by another, to the things of love, is to begin from the beauties of earth and mount upwards for the sake of that other beauty, using these as steps only, and from one going on to two, and from two to all fair forms, and from fair forms to fair practices, and from fair practices to fair notions, until from fair notions he arrives at the notion of absolute beauty, and at last knows what the essence of beauty is. This, my dear Socrates,&#39; said the stranger of Mantineia, &#39;is that life above all others which man should live, in the contemplation of beauty absolute; a beauty which if you once beheld, you would see not to be after the measure of gold, and garments, and fair boys and youths, whose presence now entrances you; and you and many a one would be content to live seeing them only and conversing with them without meat or drink, if that were possible&mdash;you only want to look at them and to be with them. But what if man had eyes to see the true beauty&mdash;the divine beauty, I mean, pure and clear and unalloyed, not clogged with the pollutions of mortality and all the colours and vanities of human life&mdash;thither looking, and holding converse with the true beauty simple and divine? Remember how in that communion only, beholding beauty with the eye of the mind, he will be enabled to bring forth, not images of beauty, but realities (for he has hold not of an image but of a reality), and bringing forth and nourishing true virtue to become the friend of God and be immortal, if mortal man may. Would that be an ignoble life?&#39;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n","authorId":null,"subject":"philosophy","tags":null,"img":null,"summary":"Plato discusses Love in two of his dialogues. Does love spoil you?
