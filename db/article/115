But the hope is to use them for development of new breakthroughs in science, medications to save lives, machine learning methods to diagnose illnesses sooner, materials to make more efficient devices and structures.</p>\n\n<h2>Fundamentals of its working</h2>\n\n<p>How is information stored. The classical way is to store them as bits (zeroes and ones). And then map sequences of 0s and 1s to symbols (which represent the information that we want to store e.g. a sentence) that we want to encode. Any information about a physical system can be represented using bits.</p>\n\n<p>But that is not the only way. Think about it: what does it mean to store information? If we somehow perform a series of some specific actions, and the result is consistent, doesn&#39;t it mean we have stored information?</p>\n\n<p>And what does computation mean? If we somehow change the system in a consistent way and get to a new state of the system, doesn&#39;t it mean we have performed computation?</p>\n\n<p><strong>Fundamental shift of understanding that is required in understanding Qubits is this: in classical world we have certainty that the bit is either 0 or 1, it can be probabilistic as well in some models, but in reality at one time it will be just in one of two states. However in quantum world, Qubit can be both 0 and 1 at the same time. But how is it useful then if every qubit is both 0 and 1 all the time? </strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Because when we MEASURE it, it becomes either 0 or 1; <em>(</em></strong><em>but during the computation, it is both</em><strong><em>)</em></strong></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Quantum Computers start with an Initial State with a few set of Qubits (which are trapped elementary particles that can be controlled and measured for their physical attributes). All of these particles are entangled. By Quantum Mechanics theory and experiments we know that if we measure one particle, all the entangled particles will also be affected, and hence the whole system reaches a new state. We continue this and reach a final state.</p>\n\n<p>Three quantum mechanical properties &mdash; superposition, entanglement, and interference &mdash; are used in quantum computing to manipulate the state of a qubit.</p>\n\n<div class=\"ibm-grid-col-lg-16-5 ibm-grid-col-md-8-4\" data-v-6b18af0f=\"\" style=\"text-align: left;\">\n<p class=\"ibm-type-f\" data-v-6b18af0f=\"\"><strong>Superposition</strong></p>\n\n<p class=\"ibm-type-b\" data-v-6b18af0f=\"\">Superposition refers to a combination of states we would ordinarily describe independently. To make a classical analogy, if you play two musical notes at once, what you will hear is a superposition of the two notes.</p>\n\n<div class=\"ibm-grid-col-lg-16-5 ibm-grid-col-md-8-4\" data-v-6b18af0f=\"\" style=\"text-align: left;\">\n<p class=\"ibm-type-f\" data-v-6b18af0f=\"\"><strong>Entanglement</strong></p>\n\n<p class=\"ibm-type-b\" data-v-6b18af0f=\"\">Entanglement is a famously counter-intuitive quantum phenomenon describing behavior we never see in the classical world.

Similarly when applied to 1 it gives us 50% probability that result will be 1 and 50% that it will be 0; but when applied to 1 it changes (reverses) the phase.</p>\n\n<p class=\"ibm-type-b\" data-v-6b18af0f=\"\">&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"ibm-type-b\" data-v-6b18af0f=\"\">Due to quantum interference, there is an interesting practical implication:</p>\n\n<p class=\"ibm-type-b\" data-v-6b18af0f=\"\">&nbsp;If you start with Qubit=0, and then apply Hadamard operator twice, and measure it you will always get 0 back. This is because opposite phases cancel each other out and the probability of 1 becomes 0. Similarly if initial value was 1, applying this operator twice will result in 1 always.</p>\n\n<p class=\"ibm-type-b\" data-v-6b18af0f=\"\"><a href=\"https://davidbkemp.github.io/QuantumComputingArticle/\">See this page for explanation</a></p>\n\n<p class=\"ibm-type-b\" data-v-6b18af0f=\"\">&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"ibm-type-f timeline-title\" data-v-3196f830=\"\"><strong>DiVincenzo Criteria</strong></p>\n\n<p>IBM researcher David DiVincenzo outlines five minimal requirements for creating a quantum computer:</p>\n\n<ol>\n\t<li>a well-defined scalable qubit array;</li>\n\t<li>an ability to initialize the state of the qubits to a simple fiducial state;</li>\n\t<li>a &ldquo;universal&rdquo; set of quantum gates;</li>\n\t<li>long coherence times, much longer than the gate-operation time;</li>\n\t<li>single-qubit measurement.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h2>Simulation of Quantum Circuits on Classical Supercomputers</h2>\n\n<p>There are Quantum Devices made of Qubits.
