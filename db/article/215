What we term virtue is often but a mass of various actions and divers interests, which fortune, or our own industry, manage to arrange; and it is not always from valour or from chastity that men are brave, and women chaste.<br />\n&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Who combats bravely is not therefore brave, He dreads a death-bed like the meanest slave; Who reasons wisely is not therefore wise, His pride in reasoning, not in acting, lies.&quot; Pope, Moral Essays, Ep. i. line 115.</p>\n\n<p>The duration of our passions is no more dependant upon us than the duration of our life. [Then what becomes of free will?&mdash;Aim&eacute;; Martin]</p>\n\n<p>8. The passions are the only advocates which always persuade. They are a natural art, the rules of which are infallible; and the simplest man with passion will be more persuasive than the most eloquent without.<br />\nThere is no less eloquence in the voice, in the eyes and in the air of a speaker than in his choice of words.</p>\n\n<p>10. In the human heart there is a perpetual generation of passions; so that the ruin of one is almost always the foundation of another.</p>\n\n<p>14. Men are not only prone to forget benefits and injuries; they even hate those who have obliged them, and cease to hate those who have injured them. The necessity of revenging an injury or of recompensing a benefit seems a slavery to which they are unwilling to submit.</p>\n\n<p>The moderation of those who are happy arises from the calm which good fortune bestows upon their temper.</p>\n\n<p>The constancy of the wise is only the talent of concealing the agitation of their hearts.</p>\n\n<p>Philosophy triumphs easily over past evils and future evils; but present evils triumph over it.</p>\n\n<p>Few people know death, we only endure it, usually from determination, and even from stupidity and custom; and most men only die because they know not how to prevent dying.</p>\n\n<p>Neither the sun nor death can be looked at without winking.</p>\n\n<p>Jealousy is in a manner just and reasonable, as it tends to preserve a good which belongs, or which we believe belongs to us, on the other hand envy is a fury which cannot endure the happiness of others.</p>\n\n<p>The evil that we do does not attract to us so much persecution and hatred as our good qualities.</p>\n\n<p>Jealousy lives upon doubt; and comes to an end or becomes a fury as soon as it passes from doubt to certainty.</p>\n\n<p>Pride indemnifies itself and loses nothing even when it casts away vanity.&nbsp;<br />\nOur pride is often increased by what we retrench from our other faults.<br />\n&quot;The loss of sensual pleasures was supplied and compensated by spiritual pride.&quot;&mdash;Gibbon. Decline And Fall, chap. xv.</p>\n\n<p>If we had no pride we should not complain of that of others.<br />\n&quot;The proud are ever most provoked by pride.&quot;&mdash;Cowper, Conversation 160.</p>\n\n<p>Pride is much the same in all men, the only difference is the method and manner of showing it.<br />\n[&quot;Pride bestowed on all a common friend.&quot;&mdash;Pope, Essay On Man, Ep. ii., line 273.]</p>\n\n<p>It would seem that nature, which has so wisely ordered the organs of our body for our happiness, has also given us pride to spare us the mortification of knowing our imperfections.</p>\n\n<p>We promise according to our hopes; we perform according to our fears.<br />\n[&quot;The reason why the Cardinal (Mazarin) deferred so long to grant the favours he had promised, was because he was persuaded that hope was much more capable of keeping men to their duty than gratitude.&quot;&mdash;Fragments Historiques. Racine.]</p>\n\n<p>Those who apply themselves too closely to little things often become incapable of great things.</p>\n\n<p>Happiness is in the taste, and not in the things themselves; we are happy from possessing what we like, not from possessing what others like.</p>\n\n<p>We are never so happy or so unhappy as we suppose.</p>\n\n<p>Those who think they have merit persuade themselves that they are honoured by being unhappy, in order to persuade others and themselves that they are worthy to be the butt of fortune.<br />\nAmbition has been so strong as to make very miserable men take comfort that they were supreme in misery; and certain it is{, that where} we cannot distinguish ourselves by something excellent, we begin to take a complacency in some singular infirmities, follies, or defects of one kind or other.&quot; &mdash;Burke, {On The Sublime And Beautiful, (1756), Part I, Sect. XVII}.]</p>\n\n<p>The contempt of riches in philosophers was only a hidden desire to avenge their merit upon the injustice of fortune, by despising the very goods of which fortune had deprived them; it was a secret to guard themselves against the degradation of poverty, it was a back way by which to arrive at that distinction which they could not gain by riches.<br />\n&quot;It is always easy as well as agreeable for the inferior ranks of mankind to claim merit from the contempt of that pomp and pleasure which fortune has placed beyond their reach. The virtue of the primitive Christians, like that of the first Romans, was very frequently guarded by poverty and ignorance.&quot;&mdash;Gibbon, Decline And Fall, Chap. 15.</p>\n\n<p>To establish ourselves in the world we do everything to appear as if we were established.</p>\n\n<p>It would seem that our actions have lucky or unlucky stars to which they owe a great part of the blame or praise which is given them.</p>\n\n<p>The happiness or unhappiness of men depends no less upon their dispositions than their fortunes.<br />\n[&quot;Still to ourselves in every place consigned Our own felicity we make or find.&quot; Goldsmith, Traveller, 431.]</p>\n\n<p>Sincerity is an openness of heart; we find it in very few people; what we usually see is only an artful dissimulation to win the confidence of others.</p>\n\n<p>The aversion to lying is often a hidden ambition to render our words credible and weighty, and to attach a religious aspect to our conversation.</p>\n\n<p>Truth does not do as much good in the world, as its counterfeits do evil.</p>\n\n<p>What grace is to the body good sense is to the mind.</p>\n\n<p>It is difficult to define love; all we can say is, that in the soul it is a desire to rule, in the mind it is a sympathy, and in the body it is a hidden and delicate wish to possess what we love&mdash;Plus many mysteries.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Love is the love of one {singularly,} with desire to be singularly beloved.&quot;&mdash;Hobbes{Leviathan, (1651), Part I, Chapter VI}.</p>\n\n<p>If there is a pure love, exempt from the mixture of our other passions, it is that which is concealed at the bottom of the heart and of which even ourselves are ignorant.</p>\n\n<p>There is no disguise which can long hide love where it exists, nor feign it where it does not.</p>\n\n<p>If we judge of love by the majority of its results it rather resembles hatred than friendship.</p>\n\n<p>We may find women who have never indulged in an intrigue, but it is rare to find those who have intrigued but once.<br />\n[&quot;Yet there are some, they say, who have had {None}; But those who have, ne&#39;er end with only one}.&quot; {&mdash;Lord Byron, }Don Juan, {Canto} iii., stanza 4.]</p>\n\n<p>There is only one sort of love, but there are a thousand different copies.</p>\n\n<p>Neither love nor fire can subsist without perpetual motion; both cease to live so soon as they cease to hope, or to fear.<br />\n[So Lord Byron{Stanzas, (1819), stanza 3} says of Love&mdash; &quot;Like chiefs of faction, His life is action.&quot;]</p>\n\n<p>There is real love just as there are real ghosts; every person speaks of it, few persons have seen it.</p>\n\n<p>Love lends its name to an infinite number of engagements (Commerces) which are attributed to it, but with which it has no more concern than the Doge (the chief magistrate of Venice) has with all that is done in Venice.</p>\n\n<p>The love of justice is simply in the majority of men the fear of suffering injustice.</p>\n\n<p>Silence is the best resolve for him who distrusts himself.</p>\n\n<p>What renders us so changeable in our friendship is, that it is difficult to know the qualities of the soul, but easy to know those of the mind.</p>\n\n<p>We can love nothing but what agrees with us, and we can only follow our taste or our pleasure when we prefer our friends to ourselves; nevertheless it is only by that preference that friendship can be true and perfect.</p>\n\n<p>What men term friendship is merely a partnership with a collection of reciprocal interests, and an exchange of favours&mdash;in fact it is but a trade in which self love always expects to gain something.</p>\n\n<p>It is more disgraceful to distrust than to be deceived by our friends.</p>\n\n<p>We often persuade ourselves to love people who are more powerful than we are, yet interest alone produces our friendship; we do not give our hearts away for the good we wish to do, but for that we expect to receive.</p>\n\n<p>Our distrust of another justifies his deceit.</p>\n\n<p>Men would not live long in society were they not the dupes of each other.</p>\n\n<p>Old men delight in giving good advice as a consolation for the fact that they can no longer set bad examples.</p>\n\n<p>The test of extraordinary merit is to see those who envy it the most yet obliged to praise it.</p>\n\n<p>Gallantry of mind is saying the most empty things in an agreeable manner.</p>\n\n<p>Ideas often flash across our minds more complete than we could make them after much labour.</p>\n\n<p>The head is ever the dupe of the heart.<br />\n[A feeble imitation of that great thought &quot;All folly comes from the heart.&quot;&mdash;Aim&eacute; Martin. ]</p>\n\n<p>Those who know their minds do not necessarily know their hearts.</p>\n\n<p>A man for whom accident discovers sense, is not a rational being. A man only is so who understands, who distinguishes, who tests it.</p>\n\n<p>To understand matters rightly we should understand their details, and as that knowledge is almost infinite, our knowledge is always superficial and imperfect.</p>\n\n<p>One kind of flirtation is to boast we never flirt.</p>\n\n<p>The head cannot long play the part of the heart.</p>\n\n<p>Youth changes its tastes by the warmth of its blood, age retains its tastes by habit.</p>\n\n<p>Nothing is given so profusely as advice.</p>\n\n<p>The more we love a woman the more prone we are to hate her.</p>\n\n<p>The blemishes of the mind, like those of the face, increase by age.</p>\n\n<p>We are inconsolable at being deceived by our enemies and betrayed by our friends, yet still we are often content to be thus served by ourselves.</p>\n\n<p>It is as easy unwittingly to deceive oneself as to deceive others.</p>\n\n<p>Nothing is less sincere than the way of asking and giving advice. The person asking seems to pay deference to the opinion of his friend, while thinking in reality of making his friend approve his opinion and be responsible for his conduct. The person giving the advice returns the confidence placed in him by eager and disinterested zeal, in doing which he is usually guided only by his own interest or reputation.<br />\n[&quot;I have often thought how ill-natured a maxim it was which on many occasions I have heard from people of good understanding, &lsquo;That as to what related to private conduct no one was ever the better for advice.&#39; But upon further examination I have resolved with myself that the maxim might be admitted without any violent prejudice to mankind. For in the manner advice was generally given there was no reason I thought to wonder it should be so ill received, something there was which strangely inverted the case, and made the giver to be the only gainer. For by what I could observe in many occurrences of our lives, that which we called giving advice was properly taking an occasion to show our own wisdom at another&#39;s expense. On the other side to be instructed or to receive advice on the terms usually prescribed to us was little better than tamely to afford another the occasion of raising himself a character from our defects.&quot;&mdash;Lord Shaftesbury, Characteristics, i., 153.]</p>\n\n<p>The most subtle of our acts is to simulate blindness for snares that we know are set for us. We are never so easily deceived as when trying to deceive.</p>\n\n<p>The intention of never deceiving often exposes us to deception.</p>\n\n<p>We become so accustomed to disguise ourselves to others that at last we are disguised to ourselves.<br />\n[&quot;Those who quit their proper character{,} to assume what does not belong to them, are{,} for the greater part{,} ignorant both of the character they leave{,} and of the character they assume.&quot;&mdash;Burke, {Reflections On The Revolution In France, (1790), Paragraph 19}.]</p>\n\n<p>We often act treacherously more from weakness than from a fixed motive.</p>\n\n<p>We frequently do good to enable us with impunity to do evil.</p>\n\n<p>If we conquer our passions it is more from their weakness than from our strength.</p>\n\n<p>If we never flattered ourselves we should have but scant pleasure.</p>\n\n<p>The most deceitful persons spend their lives in blaming deceit, so as to use it on some great occasion to promote some great interest.</p>\n\n<p>The daily employment of cunning marks a little mind, it generally happens that those who resort to it in one respect to protect themselves lay themselves open to attack in another.<br />\n[&quot;With that low cunning which in fools supplies, And amply, too, the place of being wise.&quot; Churchill, Rosciad, 117.]</p>\n\n<p>Cunning and treachery are the offspring of incapacity.</p>\n\n<p>The true way to be deceived is to think oneself more knowing than others.</p>\n\n<p>Too great cleverness is but deceptive delicacy, true delicacy is the most substantial cleverness.</p>\n\n<p>It is sometimes necessary to play the fool to avoid being deceived by cunning men.</p>\n\n<p>Weakness is the only fault which cannot be cured.</p>\n\n<p>The smallest fault of women who give themselves up to love is to love.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>It is far easier to be wise for others than to be so for oneself.<br />\n[Hence the proverb, &quot;A man who is his own lawyer has a fool for his client.&quot;]</p>\n\n<p>The only good examples are those, that make us see the absurdity of bad originals.</p>\n\n<p>We are never so ridiculous from the habits we have as from those that we affect (pretend) to have.</p>\n\n<p>There are some who never would have loved if they never had heard it spoken of.</p>\n\n<p>A man would rather say evil of himself than say nothing.</p>\n\n<p>If it was not for the company of fools, a witty man would often be greatly at a loss.</p>\n\n<p>As it is the mark of great minds to say many things in a few words, so it is that of little minds to use many words to say nothing.</p>\n\n<p>[&quot;So much they talked, so very little said.&quot; Churchill, Rosciad, 550.<br />\n&quot;Men who are unequal to the labour of discussing an argument or wish to avoid it, are willing enough to suppose that much has been proved because much has been said.&quot;&mdash; Junius, Jan. 1769.]</p>\n\n<p>It is oftener by the estimation of our own feelings that we exaggerate the good qualities of others than by their merit, and when we praise them we wish to attract their praise.</p>\n\n<p>We do not like to praise, and we never praise without a motive. Praise is flattery, artful, hidden, delicate, which gratifies differently him who praises and him who is praised. The one takes it as the reward of merit, the other bestows it to show his impartiality and knowledge.</p>\n\n<p>Usually we only praise to be praised.</p>\n\n<p>The refusal of praise is only the wish to be praised twice.<br />\n[The modesty which pretends to refuse praise is but in truth a desire to be praised more highly. Edition 1665.]</p>\n\n<p>The desire which urges us to deserve praise strengthens our good qualities, and praise given to wit, valour, and beauty, tends to increase them.</p>\n\n<p>It is easier to govern others than to prevent being governed.</p>\n\n<p>If we never flattered ourselves the flattery of others would not hurt us.</p>\n\n<p>There are some persons who only disgust with their abilities, there are persons who please even with their faults.</p>\n\n<p>The fame of great men ought always to be estimated by the means used to acquire it.</p>\n\n<p>Flattery is base coin to which only our vanity gives currency.</p>\n\n<p>It is not enough to have great qualities, we should also have the management of them.</p>\n\n<p>However brilliant an action it should not be esteemed great unless the result of a great motive.</p>\n\n<p>A certain harmony should be kept between actions and ideas if we desire to estimate the effects that they produce.</p>\n\n<p>It is much easier to seem fitted for posts we do not fill than for those we do.</p>\n\n<p>The world oftener rewards the appearance of merit than merit itself.</p>\n\n<p>Avarice (extreme greed) is more opposed to economy than to liberality (quality of giving away freely).</p>\n\n<p>However deceitful hope may be, yet she carries us on pleasantly to the end of life.<br />\n[&quot;Hope travels through, nor quits us when we die.&quot; Pope: Essay On Man, Ep. ii.]</p>\n\n<p>Idleness and fear keeps us in the path of duty, but our virtue often gets the praise.</p>\n\n<p>If one acts rightly and honestly, it is difficult to decide whether it is the effect of integrity or skill.</p>\n\n<p>There are different kinds of curiosity: one springs from interest, which makes us desire to know everything that may be profitable to us; another from pride, which springs from a desire of knowing what others are ignorant of.</p>\n\n<p>It is far better to accustom our mind to bear the ills we have than to speculate on those which may befall us.<br />\n[&quot;Rather bear th{ose} ills we have Than fly to others that we know not of.&quot; {&mdash;Shakespeare, Hamlet, Act III, Scene I, Hamlet.}]</p>\n\n<p>Constancy in love is a perpetual inconstancy which causes our heart to attach itself to all the qualities of the person we love in succession, sometimes giving the preference to one, sometimes to another. This constancy is merely inconstancy fixed, and limited to the same person.</p>\n\n<p>There are two kinds of constancy in love, one arising from incessantly finding in the loved one fresh objects to love, the other from regarding it as a point of honour to be constant.</p>\n\n<p>Perseverance is not deserving of blame or praise, as it is merely the continuance of tastes and feelings which we can neither create or destroy.</p>\n\n<p>Our repentance is not so much sorrow for the ill we have done as fear of the ill that may happen to us.</p>\n\n<p>Vices enter into the composition of virtues as poison into that of medicines. Prudence collects and blends the two and renders them useful against the ills of life.</p>\n\n<p>We admit our faults to repair by our sincerity the evil we have done in the opinion of others. [We never admit our faults except through vanity.]</p>\n\n<p>There are both heroes of evil and heroes of good.</p>\n\n<p>We do not despise all who have vices, but we do despise all who have not virtues.<br />\n[&quot;If individuals have no virtues their vices may be of use to us.&quot;&mdash;Junius, 5th Oct. 1771.]</p>\n\n<p>The health of the mind is not less uncertain than that of the body, and when passions seem furthest removed we are no less in danger of infection than of falling ill when we are well.</p>\n\n<p>It seems that nature has at man&#39;s birth fixed the bounds of his virtues and vices.</p>\n\n<p>We may say vices wait on us in the course of our life as the landlords with whom we successively lodge, and if we travelled the road twice over I doubt if our experience would make us avoid them.</p>\n\n<p>When our vices leave us we flatter ourselves with the idea we have left them.</p>\n\n<p>There are relapses in the diseases of the mind as in those of the body; what we call a cure is often no more than an intermission or change of disease.</p>\n\n<p>The defects of the mind are like the wounds of the body.

But why do we need her instruction?&quot;&mdash;Sterne, Sermons.]</p>\n\n<p><br />\nGratitude is as the good faith of merchants: it holds commerce together; and we do not pay because it is just to pay debts, but because we shall thereby more easily find people who will lend.</p>\n\n<p>All those who pay the debts of gratitude cannot thereby flatter themselves that they are grateful.</p>\n\n<p>The good we have received from a man should make us excuse the wrong he does us.</p>\n\n<p>It would seem that even self-love may be the dupe of goodness and forget itself when we work for others. And yet it is but taking the shortest way to arrive at its aim, taking usury under the pretext of giving, in fact winning everybody in a subtle and delicate manner.</p>\n\n<p>No one should be praised for his goodness if he has not strength enough to be wicked.
