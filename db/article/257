I think this is aiming at&nbsp;the first chapter of the Upanishads, which says that if you kill animals for sacrifice, you will attain heaven.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>&quot;If none of the six senses are there to perceive it, then there is no phenomenon.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>...</p>\n\n<p>Buddha said that &ldquo;form is like a bubble and feeling is like a bubble&rdquo;, meaning they are essenceless, that they have no substantial existence. There is no true existence, no reality in there. The Buddha also said that &ldquo;perception is like a mirage, and karmic formation is like a banana tree&rdquo;. A banana tree has many layers, and when you look at it from outside, it looks very solid. But it is all just layers of skin. As you peel layer after layer of skin, you end up finding that there is nothing inside. There is no real solid substance, as it is all made out of skin. This quotation also says that consciousness is like a magical illusion.</p>\n\n<p>...</p>\n\n<p>So, in buddhism, ignorance has nothing to do with evil or misunderstanding. It is a hallucination, a mirage.&nbsp; &quot;ignorance&quot;: it&#39;s not that there is something that you should know but you don&#39;t know. In fact, you know something that is not there. You&#39;ve created something [the concepts] that is not there.</p>\n\n<p>Dualism is also ignorance. There&#39;s no objective separate from subjective, there&#39;s nothing outside mind.</p>\n\n<p>... Chandrakirti says that even if people do not have this greater kind of motivation and if they practice generosity only with worldly motivations such as becoming richer, as long as they keep on practising generosity, then eventually they will meet a superior being. This also comes from a sutra, which says that aryas, which are non-samsaric beings such as bodhisattvas, are bound to go to generous people. They are attracted to them. For example, the Buddha&rsquo;s begging bowl represents that he goes to town to beg alms.</p>\n\n<p>Buddhist&nbsp;syllogism:</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;Mental formations are not born from self because they exist, like a vase&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">Mental formations&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;1&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Subject ch&ouml;chen (chos can)</p>\n\n<p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">are not born from self&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 2&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Predicate drubj&eacute; ch&ouml; (bsgrub bya&rsquo;i chos)</p>\n\n<p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">{1 + 2}&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;3&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Proposition/Thesis drubja (bsgrub bya)</p>\n\n<p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">because they exist&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 4&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Reasoning tak (rtags)</p>\n\n<p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">like a vase&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 5&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Example p&eacute; (dpe)</p>\n\n<p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">{whole phrase}&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 6&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Syllogism jorwa (sbyor ba)</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>...</p>\n\n<p>These four views, which are known as the four great seals or the four mudras, are:</p>\n\n<ol>\n\t<li style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">All compounded things are impermanent</li>\n\t<li style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">All emotions are pain</li>\n\t<li style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">All phenomena do not have inherently existent self</li>\n\t<li style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">Enlightenment is beyond extremes</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>MMK is about the third of these.</p>\n\n<p>There are many ways in which we can establish this third view, ten of which are described in the Dashabhumika&nbsp;Sutra (see &ldquo;the ten equalities&rdquo;, p.73). But here, in the Madhyamika, we will concentrate on ky&eacute;wa mepa (skye ba med pa), no arising: &lsquo;all phenomena are equally without origination, or without arising&rsquo;.</p>\n\n<p>By studying and contemplating this kind of view, we can prove that everything that we think and everything that the world thinks is wrong. That is the whole purpose of these studies, to prove that everything that we think is wrong! MMK is especially concerned with proving all philosophies wrong &mdash; it&#39;s against &#39;philosophy&#39;.</p>\n\n<p>Jigme Lingpa, the great Nyingmapa master, said shets&eacute; nangal, samts&eacute; tr&uuml;lpa (bshad tshad nang rgal, bsam tshad &rsquo;khrul pa), &ldquo;As soon as we talk, as soon as we utter words from these lips, it is all contradiction. As soon as we think, it is all confusion&rdquo;. This is the Prasangika view, which we are going to demonstrate here.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h4><strong>Malamadhyamakakarika Text</strong></h4>\n\n<hr />\n<p>The following is a good summary of what Nagarjuna is going to establish in the text:&nbsp;</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>I prostrate to the Perfect Buddha,</p>\n\n<p>The best of teachers, who taught that</p>\n\n<p>Whatever is dependently arisen is</p>\n\n<p>Unceasing, unborn,</p>\n\n<p>Unannihilated, not permanent,</p>\n\n<p>Not coming, not going,</p>\n\n<p>Without distinction, without identity,</p>\n\n<p>And free from conceptual construction.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>Examination of Conditions</strong></p>\n\n<p>[causes and conditions&nbsp;(Skt: hetu and pratyaya) distinction]</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Neither from itself nor from another, Nor from both, Nor without a cause, Does anything whatever, anywhere arise.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The first view-held prominently by Samkhya philosophers -is that all causation is. real\u0142y self-causation. Cause already contains the (potential) effect, so cause and effect are not essentially/substantially different. The <em>swabahva</em>&nbsp;of cause and effect is not different.&nbsp;The typical kind of example appealed to in order to defend this model of causation is the seed and sprout relation. The sprout, although only actual after germination, is potentia( in the seed. lts potentiality is what makes the seed a seed of that sprout. Moreover, on this view, the seed and sprout cannot be distinguished as substantially different.&nbsp;Intuitively it makes sense to say that they are two stages of the same entity. But the seed is the cause of the sprout. Hence, the proponent of this view concludes, the sprout is self-caused.</p>\n\n<p>The second view was held by major Buddhist schools at that time. They proposed that causes and effects can exist independently of each other. Theories like atoms, and mind particles were there.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Relative and Ultimate Truth: &#39;Relative&#39; here means more like &#39;obscured&#39;, conventional (everyday life).</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>What does it mean to arise from itself?</p>\n\n<p>What does it mean to arise from another?&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>What does it mean to arise from itself, and from another?</p>\n\n<p>What does it mean to arise without a cause?</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/nagarjuna/\" target=\"_blank\">Stanford&#39;s entry on Nagarjuna</a> talks this passage in terms of cause and effect. <em>But from the above translation, it&#39;s not clear that Nagarjuna wants to talk only about abstract cause, and effect.</em></p>\n\n<p>(Can a Cause exist without an Effect? <em>Of course it can!</em>&nbsp;Although, the property of &#39;being a cause&#39; cannot exist without effect.)</p>\n\n<hr />\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n", "authorId": 1, "subject": "philosophy", "tags": [], "img": "", "summary": "", "lastUpdated": "2021-03-29 17:48:49.459868"}
