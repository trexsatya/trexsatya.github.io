This is why when Buddhist masters talk about suffering, as in &lsquo;samsara is full of suffering&rsquo;, people cannot understand. For many people, the definition of suffering is something that is painful. So, they say, &ldquo;No, I am having a nice time here right now. It is not true that whole world is full of suffering&rdquo;. Whereas from a Buddhist point of view, even getting a suntan while having a nice time on the beach is a form of suffering, because your body is getting roasted and more wrinkled, and the clock is ticking all the time.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Madhyamika-Prasangika and&nbsp;Madhyamika-Svatantrika</p>\n\n<p>First one focussed on prasanga, or reductio ad absurdum =&gt; Just destroy opponent&#39;s views by showing that their view leads to absurdities.</p>\n\n<p>Second one also tried to give counter-arguments.</p>\n\n<p>...</p>\n\n<p>If a text does not have these four qualities, there is no reason to study and practise the text:</p>\n\n<p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">&bull; <strong>Subject:</strong> vakya, shes bya</p>\n\n<p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">&bull; <strong>Purpose:</strong> prayojana, dgos pa</p>\n\n<p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">&bull; <strong>Ultimate purpose:</strong> paramartha, nying dgos</p>\n\n<p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">&bull; <strong>Link:</strong> sambhanda, &rsquo;brel ba</p>\n\n<p>&quot;... there are texts that have no link. I think this is aiming at&nbsp;the first chapter of the Upanishads, which says that if you kill animals for sacrifice, you will attain heaven.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>There&#39;s Buddha nature in everybody, one that makes the person want happiness, that understands pain and suffering. Compassion can be developed through understanding of pain, if a person doesn&#39;t even understand pain, how can compassion be developed? A person who inflicts pain upon others definitely understands pain. <span style=\"color:#8e44ad;\"><em>[BUT HOW DO YOU MAKE THAT PERSON REALISE THIS?]</em></span></p>\n\n<p>Someone who understands non-duality has no such fixation on socalled goals, which is why bodhisattvas can continue to help sentient beings year after year, life after life. Since they are not goal-oriented, they do not give up. They do not say things like &ldquo;I can never cure all sentient beings, so I will not try&rdquo;. <span style=\"color:#8e44ad;\"><em>[THIS RESONATES WITH THE PRESCRIBED METHOD OF ACTION IN BHAGVAD GITA]</em></span></p>\n\n<p><em>[THE BOOK LAYS CLEVER ARGUMENTS SUPPORTING THE NEED THAT SOME BUDDHISTS FEEL TOWARDS TEACHING THEIR PATH TO OTHERS]</em></p>\n\n<p>When the Mahayana says a flower does not exist, it actually means that the flower is free from the four extremes: it is not existent, nor is it non-existent, nor both existent and non-existent, and not neither existent nor non-existent.&nbsp;. If you understand this, you will not ask questions like &ldquo;how can the Mahayana say this tent does not exist? I can see it&rdquo;. Chandrakirti will say it is not existent but also not non-existent. To our normal mind, &lsquo;not non-existent&rsquo; means that it is sort of existent, but then Chandrakirti tells us that&rsquo;s not it either. Whichever side you go to, Chandrakirti is there, saying, &ldquo;No, this isn&rsquo;t it!&rdquo; That is why it is called the Middle Way. And after all this, Nagarjuna says that a learned one should not even remain in the Middle Way!</p>\n\n<p>Madhyamika is about&nbsp;selflessness of phenomena, and not just the selflessness of the person.</p>\n\n<p>If we look at the framework for the whole of the Madhyamika, there are two things to be realised:</p>\n\n<p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">&bull; Absence of existence of the individual self: gang zag gi bdag med</p>\n\n<p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">&bull; Absence of existence of phenomena: chos kyi bdag med</p>\n\n<p>And there are two defilements to be eliminated:</p>\n\n<p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">&bull; Clinging to/belief in the individual self bdag &rsquo;dzin</p>\n\n<p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">&bull; Clinging to/belief in existence of phenomena chos kyi bdag &rsquo;dzin</p>\n\n<p>...</p>\n\n<p>&quot;If none of the six senses are there to perceive it, then there is no phenomenon.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>...</p>\n\n<p>Buddha said that &ldquo;form is like a bubble and feeling is like a bubble&rdquo;, meaning they are essenceless, that they have no substantial existence. There is no true existence, no reality in there. The Buddha also said that &ldquo;perception is like a mirage, and karmic formation is like a banana tree&rdquo;. A banana tree has many layers, and when you look at it from outside, it looks very solid. But it is all just layers of skin. As you peel layer after layer of skin, you end up finding that there is nothing inside. There is no real solid substance, as it is all made out of skin. This quotation also says that consciousness is like a magical illusion.</p>\n\n<p>...</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;So, in buddhism, ignorance has nothing to do with evil or misunderstanding. It is a hallucination, a mirage. Clearance on &quot;ignorance&quot;: it&#39;s not that there is something that you should know but you don&#39;t know. In fact, you know something that is not there. You&#39;ve created something [the concepts] that is not there.</p>\n\n<p>Dualism is also ignorance. There&#39;s no objective separate from subjective, there&#39;s nothing outside mind.</p>\n\n<p>... Chandrakirti says that even if people do not have this greater kind of motivation and if they practice generosity only with worldly motivations such as becoming richer, as long as they keep on practising generosity, then eventually they will meet a superior being. This also comes from a sutra, which says that aryas, which are non-samsaric beings such as bodhisattvas, are bound to go to generous people. They are attracted to them. For example, the Buddha&rsquo;s begging bowl represents that he goes to town to beg alms.</p>\n\n<p>For a bodhisattva, the motivation is that others can become happy, so naturally he gains his result more quickly.</p>\n\n<p>[Q]: Do bodhisattvas intend to make themselves happy?</p>\n\n<p>[A]: No, they do not. This is actually quite an important thing for Mahayana buddhists to know. If, for example, you are supposed to build a temple for your teacher, then as soon as you have the intention to build it, that pure intention, then it is already a success. Success does not depend on actually managing to build the temple and having a consecration ceremony. As soon as you have that motivation, it is the end of an act. But this does not mean that you should just be happy with it. Of course, you can accumulate more actions that are positive. But if the temple were to be destroyed by wind or an earthquake, a bodhisattva would have no regrets. Instead of giving up, he would build it again.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>How do we know whether a person has the qualities of a listener? Even an ordinary being may have repeated joy upon hearing the teachings on emptiness. The sign of such joy is that it will bring forth tears that moisten his eyes, and make the hairs on his body quiver. This kind of person has the seed for enlightenment, and can receive instructions on both the selflessness of phenomena and the selflessness of the person.</p>\n\n<p><em>[THIS, I THINK, HAS BECOME A THING OF PAST]</em></p>\n\n<p>The first kind of person is someone who already has an established philosophy, such as Hinduism or buddhism. This is why it is much easier to teach a hard-line Moslem or Christian, because at least they have a view, and then we can debate. It is so difficult to teach New Age people, because they are like honey. They paste things from here and there, they do not know what they are talking about and we do not know where we should be directing our arguments. There is a big difference between rim&eacute; (ris med) non-sectarian, and New Age. Rim&eacute; always tries to be as authentic as possible, and to have pure vision, whereas New Age people are always diluting everything, from classical music to Dharma.</p>\n\n<p>Like any other ideas, like science, economics and politics, Madhyamika philosophy is trying to build a better society, very simply speaking. In fact, if possible, the Madhyamika aims to create&nbsp;an enlightened society.</p>\n\n<p>The path and the philosophy are two different things. But&nbsp;without a philosophy, there is no dialogue to establish the path. There is no means or medium.</p>\n\n<p>Buddhist&nbsp;syllogism:</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;Mental formations are not born from self because they exist, like a vase&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">Mental formations&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;1&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Subject ch&ouml;chen (chos can)</p>\n\n<p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">are not born from self&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 2&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Predicate drubj&eacute; ch&ouml; (bsgrub bya&rsquo;i chos)</p>\n\n<p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">{1 + 2}&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;3&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Proposition/Thesis drubja (bsgrub bya)</p>\n\n<p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">because they exist&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 4&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Reasoning tak (rtags)</p>\n\n<p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">like a vase&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 5&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Example p&eacute; (dpe)</p>\n\n<p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">{whole phrase}&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;6&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Syllogism jorwa (sbyor ba)</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&quot;To the lord Buddha, Who taught us the view-less teaching, In order to destroy all views, I prostrate.&quot; This is actually the aim of the Prasangika Madhyamika, to destroy all views.</p>\n\n<p>[Q]: What about the Four Noble Truths? Surely, they are also a view?</p>\n\n<p>[A]: Yes. The Prasangikas accept all that, but only for the sake of others. But you might ask them, how could you say that you are debating with your opponents out of your compassion for them? If you do not have a view, then why do you say that you have compassion? Their answer is that they are not saying that they have established their compassion as logically or truly existing. They know very well that compassion is illusion. Yet, the Prasangikas talk about compassion the most; all is for the sake of other beings. And the fact that we cannot accept that they do not have a view tells us how strong our emotions are towards having a view.</p>\n\n<p>[Q]: When one attains enlightenment, there is no path, so what is more important? It is the path or enlightenment?</p>\n\n<p>[A]: The path. Without the path, enlightenment is boring! The path is what makes it exciting. There are three stages of attachment on the path: the first stage is you think you are not perfect. The second stage of attachment is that you want to be perfect. And the third stage of attachment is following a path to perfection. One mahasiddha said that our first mistake is to think that we need a path.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>It is very simple. Suppose that you ask Chandrakirti whether he has some drinking water in his house. If you are thirsty, and you really want to drink some water, he will say yes. But if you are a logician, and you are there to debate with him, then he will be careful and ask you what you are talking about. There is always a difference between the path, and establishing the view.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>Malamadhyamakakarika</strong></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Neither from itself nor from another, Nor from both, Nor without a cause, Does anything whatever, anywhere arise.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>What does it mean to arise from itself?</p>\n\n<p>What does it mean to arise from another?&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>What does it mean to arise from itself, and from another?</p>\n\n<p>What does it mean to arise without a cause?</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/nagarjuna/\" target=\"_blank\">Stanford&#39;s entry on Nagarjuna</a> talks this passage in terms of cause and effect. <em>But from the above translation, it&#39;s not clear that Nagarjuna wants to talk only about abstract cause, and effect.</em></p>\n\n<p>(Can a Cause exist without an Effect? <em>Of course it can!</em>&nbsp;Although, the property of &#39;being a cause&#39; cannot exist without effect.)</p>\n\n<hr />\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n", "authorId": 1, "subject": "philosophy", "tags": [], "img": "", "summary": "", "lastUpdated": "2021-03-28 15:32:19.771203"}
