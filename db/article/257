This is why when Buddhist masters talk about suffering, as in &lsquo;samsara is full of suffering&rsquo;, people cannot understand. For many people, the definition of suffering is something that is painful. So, they say, &ldquo;No, I am having a nice time here right now. It is not true that whole world is full of suffering&rdquo;. Whereas from a Buddhist point of view, even getting a suntan while having a nice time on the beach is a form of suffering, because your body is getting roasted and more wrinkled, and the clock is ticking all the time.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Madhyamika-Prasangika and&nbsp;Madhyamika-Svatantrika</p>\n\n<p>First one focussed on prasanga, or reductio ad absurdum =&gt; Just destroy opponent&#39;s views by showing that their view leads to absurdities.</p>\n\n<p>Second one also tried to give counter-arguments.</p>\n\n<p>...</p>\n\n<p>If a text does not have these four qualities, there is no reason to study and practise the text:</p>\n\n<p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">&bull; <strong>Subject:</strong> vakya shes bya</p>\n\n<p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">&bull; <strong>Purpose:</strong> prayojana dgos pa</p>\n\n<p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">&bull; <strong>Ultimate purpose:</strong> paramartha nying dgos</p>\n\n<p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">&bull; <strong>Link:</strong> sambhanda &rsquo;brel ba</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>Malamadhyamakakarika</strong></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Neither from itself nor from another, Nor from both, Nor without a cause, Does anything whatever, anywhere arise.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>What does it mean to arise from itself?</p>\n\n<p>What does it mean to arise from another?&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>What does it mean to arise from itself, and from another?</p>\n\n<p>What does it mean to arise without a cause?</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/nagarjuna/\" target=\"_blank\">Stanford&#39;s entry on Nagarjuna</a> talks this passage in terms of cause and effect. <em>But from the above translation, it&#39;s not clear that Nagarjuna wants to talk only about abstract cause, and effect.</em></p>\n\n<p>(Can a Cause exist without an Effect? <em>Of course it can!</em>&nbsp;Although, the property of &#39;being a cause&#39; cannot exist without effect.)</p>\n\n<hr />\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n", "authorId": 1, "subject": "philosophy", "tags": [], "img": "", "summary": "", "lastUpdated": "2021-03-28 09:07:04.237071"}
