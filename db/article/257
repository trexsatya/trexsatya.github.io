This is why when Buddhist masters talk about suffering, as in &lsquo;samsara is full of suffering&rsquo;, people cannot understand. For many people, the definition of suffering is something that is painful. So, they say, &ldquo;No, I am having a nice time here right now. It is not true that whole world is full of suffering&rdquo;. Whereas from a Buddhist point of view, even getting a suntan while having a nice time on the beach is a form of suffering, because your body is getting roasted and more wrinkled, and the clock is ticking all the time.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Madhyamika-Prasangika and&nbsp;Madhyamika-Svatantrika</p>\n\n<p>First one focussed on prasanga, or reductio ad absurdum =&gt; Just destroy opponent&#39;s views by showing that their view leads to absurdities.</p>\n\n<p>Second one also tried to give counter-arguments.</p>\n\n<p>...</p>\n\n<p>If a text does not have these four qualities, there is no reason to study and practise the text:</p>\n\n<p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">&bull; <strong>Subject:</strong> vakya, shes bya</p>\n\n<p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">&bull; <strong>Purpose:</strong> prayojana, dgos pa</p>\n\n<p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">&bull; <strong>Ultimate purpose:</strong> paramartha, nying dgos</p>\n\n<p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">&bull; <strong>Link:</strong> sambhanda, &rsquo;brel ba</p>\n\n<p>&quot;... there are texts that have no link. I think this is aiming at&nbsp;the first chapter of the Upanishads, which says that if you kill animals for sacrifice, you will attain heaven.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>There&#39;s Buddha nature in everybody, one that makes the person want happiness, that understands pain and suffering. Compassion can be developed through understanding of pain, if a person doesn&#39;t even understand pain, how can compassion be developed? A person who inflicts pain upon others definitely understands pain. <span style=\"color:#8e44ad;\"><em>[BUT HOW DO YOU MAKE THAT PERSON REALISE THIS?]</em></span></p>\n\n<p>Someone who understands non-duality has no such fixation on socalled goals, which is why bodhisattvas can continue to help sentient beings year after year, life after life. Since they are not goal-oriented, they do not give up. They do not say things like &ldquo;I can never cure all sentient beings, so I will not try&rdquo;. <span style=\"color:#8e44ad;\"><em>[THIS RESONATES WITH THE PRESCRIBED METHOD OF ACTION IN BHAGVAD GITA]</em></span></p>\n\n<p><em>[THE BOOK LAYS CLEVER ARGUMENTS SUPPORTING THE NEED THAT SOME BUDDHISTS FEEL TOWARDS TEACHING THEIR PATH TO OTHERS]</em></p>\n\n<p>When the Mahayana says a flower does not exist, it actually means that the flower is free from the four extremes: it is not existent, nor is it non-existent, nor both existent and non-existent, and not neither existent nor non-existent.&nbsp;. If you understand this, you will not ask questions like &ldquo;how can the Mahayana say this tent does not exist? I can see it&rdquo;. Chandrakirti will say it is not existent but also not non-existent. To our normal mind, &lsquo;not non-existent&rsquo; means that it is sort of existent, but then Chandrakirti tells us that&rsquo;s not it either. Whichever side you go to, Chandrakirti is there, saying, &ldquo;No, this isn&rsquo;t it!&rdquo; That is why it is called the Middle Way. And after all this, Nagarjuna says that a learned one should not even remain in the Middle Way!</p>\n\n<p>Madhyamika is about&nbsp;selflessness of phenomena, and not just the selflessness of the person.</p>\n\n<p>If we look at the framework for the whole of the Madhyamika, there are two things to be realised:</p>\n\n<p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">&bull; Absence of existence of the individual self: gang zag gi bdag med</p>\n\n<p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">&bull; Absence of existence of phenomena: chos kyi bdag med</p>\n\n<p>And there are two defilements to be eliminated:</p>\n\n<p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">&bull; Clinging to/belief in the individual self bdag &rsquo;dzin</p>\n\n<p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">&bull; Clinging to/belief in existence of phenomena chos kyi bdag &rsquo;dzin</p>\n\n<p>...</p>\n\n<p>&quot;If none of the six senses are there to perceive it, then there is no phenomenon.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>...</p>\n\n<p>Buddha said that &ldquo;form is like a bubble and feeling is like a bubble&rdquo;, meaning they are essenceless, that they have no substantial existence. There is no true existence, no reality in there. The Buddha also said that &ldquo;perception is like a mirage, and karmic formation is like a banana tree&rdquo;. A banana tree has many layers, and when you look at it from outside, it looks very solid. But it is all just layers of skin. As you peel layer after layer of skin, you end up finding that there is nothing inside. There is no real solid substance, as it is all made out of skin. This quotation also says that consciousness is like a magical illusion.</p>\n\n<p>...</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;So, in buddhism, ignorance has nothing to do with evil or misunderstanding. It is a hallucination, a mirage. Clearance on &quot;ignorance&quot;: it&#39;s not that there is something that you should know but you don&#39;t know. In fact, you know something that is not there. You&#39;ve created something [the concepts] that is not there.</p>\n\n<p>Dualism is also ignorance. There&#39;s no objective separate from subjective, there&#39;s nothing outside mind.</p>\n\n<p>... Chandrakirti says that even if people do not have this greater kind of motivation and if they practice generosity only with worldly motivations such as becoming richer, as long as they keep on practising generosity, then eventually they will meet a superior being. This also comes from a sutra, which says that aryas, which are non-samsaric beings such as bodhisattvas, are bound to go to generous people. They are attracted to them. For example, the Buddha&rsquo;s begging bowl represents that he goes to town to beg alms.</p>\n\n<p>For a bodhisattva, the motivation is that others can become happy, so naturally he gains his result more quickly.</p>\n\n<p>[Q]: Do bodhisattvas intend to make themselves happy?</p>\n\n<p>[A]: No, they do not. This is actually quite an important thing for Mahayana buddhists to know. If, for example, you are supposed to build a temple for your teacher, then as soon as you have the intention to build it, that pure intention, then it is already a success. Success does not depend on actually managing to build the temple and having a consecration ceremony. As soon as you have that motivation, it is the end of an act. But this does not mean that you should just be happy with it. Of course, you can accumulate more actions that are positive. But if the temple were to be destroyed by wind or an earthquake, a bodhisattva would have no regrets. Instead of giving up, he would build it again.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>How do we know whether a person has the qualities of a listener? Even an ordinary being may have repeated joy upon hearing the teachings on emptiness. The sign of such joy is that it will bring forth tears that moisten his eyes, and make the hairs on his body quiver. This kind of person has the seed for enlightenment, and can receive instructions on both the selflessness of phenomena and the selflessness of the person.</p>\n\n<p><em>[THIS, I THINK, HAS BECOME A THING OF PAST]</em></p>\n\n<p>The first kind of person is someone who already has an established philosophy, such as Hinduism or buddhism. This is why it is much easier to teach a hard-line Moslem or Christian, because at least they have a view, and then we can debate. It is so difficult to teach New Age people, because they are like honey. They paste things from here and there, they do not know what they are talking about and we do not know where we should be directing our arguments. There is a big difference between rim&eacute; (ris med) non-sectarian, and New Age. Rim&eacute; always tries to be as authentic as possible, and to have pure vision, whereas New Age people are always diluting everything, from classical music to Dharma.</p>\n\n<p>Like any other ideas, like science, economics and politics, Madhyamika philosophy is trying to build a better society, very simply speaking. In fact, if possible, the Madhyamika aims to create&nbsp;an enlightened society.</p>\n\n<p>The path and the philosophy are two different things. But&nbsp;without a philosophy, there is no dialogue to establish the path. There is no means or medium.</p>\n\n<p>Buddhist&nbsp;syllogism:</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;Mental formations are not born from self because they exist, like a vase&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">Mental formations&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;1&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Subject ch&ouml;chen (chos can)</p>\n\n<p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">are not born from self&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 2&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Predicate drubj&eacute; ch&ouml; (bsgrub bya&rsquo;i chos)</p>\n\n<p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">{1 + 2}&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;3&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Proposition/Thesis drubja (bsgrub bya)</p>\n\n<p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">because they exist&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 4&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Reasoning tak (rtags)</p>\n\n<p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">like a vase&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 5&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Example p&eacute; (dpe)</p>\n\n<p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">{whole phrase}&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;6&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Syllogism jorwa (sbyor ba)</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&quot;To the lord Buddha, Who taught us the view-less teaching, In order to destroy all views, I prostrate.&quot; This is actually the aim of the Prasangika Madhyamika, to destroy all views.</p>\n\n<p>[Q]: What about the Four Noble Truths? Surely, they are also a view?</p>\n\n<p>[A]: Yes. The Prasangikas accept all that, but only for the sake of others. But you might ask them, how could you say that you are debating with your opponents out of your compassion for them? If you do not have a view, then why do you say that you have compassion? Their answer is that they are not saying that they have established their compassion as logically or truly existing. They know very well that compassion is illusion. Yet, the Prasangikas talk about compassion the most; all is for the sake of other beings. And the fact that we cannot accept that they do not have a view tells us how strong our emotions are towards having a view.</p>\n\n<p>[Q]: When one attains enlightenment, there is no path, so what is more important? It is the path or enlightenment?</p>\n\n<p>[A]: The path. Without the path, enlightenment is boring! The path is what makes it exciting. There are three stages of attachment on the path: the first stage is you think you are not perfect. The second stage of attachment is that you want to be perfect. And the third stage of attachment is following a path to perfection. One mahasiddha said that our first mistake is to think that we need a path.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>It is very simple. Suppose that you ask Chandrakirti whether he has some drinking water in his house. If you are thirsty, and you really want to drink some water, he will say yes. But if you are a logician, and you are there to debate with him, then he will be careful and ask you what you are talking about. There is always a difference between the path, and establishing the view.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>There are two subcategories to &ldquo;Refuting objections to the Prasangika&rdquo;: based on establishing the relative, and based on establishing the ultimate. Relative: At times in this text, it will seem like the Prasangikas are accepting things. For example, they might accept that there is smoke, but they do not accept things for themselves. They are only saying that they agree in order for the other person to understand that there is fire. Ultimate: When the Prasangikas say they have no assertions, it is important to know that by saying this, they are not making another assertion. In this way, no logic can ever enter into this kind of statement, even though it is not a thesis.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>I am telling you this because the ideas of true and not true are the basis upon which we develop our philosophies, ethics, religions and everything else. For example, the Vedic religions have the idea that God is truth. Again, you can see here that the definition of truth is something that is not a fake. It is something that is unfabricated, something that has always been there whether you fabricate it or not, something independent from all causes and conditions. It is like the difference between magic and non-magic. For example, this tent is true; it is real, because it is not dependent on a magician. If a magician were somehow to display a magical tent, then it would be a fake. The magician would have created it, and it would be dependent on him. We would say that it was his idea, his trick.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>The Vaibhashika school in buddhism has extensively defeated the idea or notion of God, and shown that it is a fabrication of whatever the religion. For the Vaibhashikas, only two smallest&nbsp;things exist: a very small thing like an atom, and a very small particle of mind. This is why we call them Vaibhashika, which means &lsquo;proponent of discrete entities&rsquo; (bye brag smra ba). The Sautrantika view is very similar, although there are some differences. The Cittamatra school has extensively defeated these ideas of the Vaibhashikas and Sautrantikas, and they conclude that only mind is truly existent. Everything else is just an illusion.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Not created by itself, how can it be created by another? Not created by both, what exists without a cause?</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>According to the Samkhyas, there are two basic categories in the universe: purusha and prakriti. They say that the history of the world is the history of these two fundamental constituents, which is quite different from Upanishad thought. From this simple dualism develops a very complex set of interrelations between purusha, which is like the spirit of atman, and prakriti, which is like the matter of original nature. The nature of purusha is spirit; it is many spirits. It is being, consciousness. It is limitless, untainted awareness. The Samkhyas argue that the world is formed as purusha infuses prakriti, and thereby stimulates the three states of prakriti, which are called the three gunas. These are activity (rajas in Sanskrit), inactivity (tamas) and transparency (sattva).</p>\n\n<p>The gunas interact and play different parts in the development of prakriti. As prakriti is activated, it becomes buddhi, or intellect, out of which individual egos evolve. Individuals often confuse their ego with their true self, and liberation can only happen when the true distinction is understood. The true liberation is obtained at death, when the bonds between purusha and prakriti are dissolved.</p>\n\n<p>The Samkhya school also believes strongly in causation. This part is important. They argue for cause, effect and the indestructibility of matter. Scientists say something quite like this. It is known as the theory of existent effect, which means that the effect already exists in the cause of all things. So, in some mysterious way, the cause of something pre-exists its effect, although they are distinct. Consider a jar of clay, for example. The jar is the clay, but it is not the lump of clay.&nbsp;The basic idea is that what already exists cannot change, and what is not existent cannot be born.&nbsp;If the pot does not already exist there, then it cannot be born. So, no matter how a potter might try to make a pot, he could never create one.</p>\n\n<p>Even when a cook boils an egg, there is a complete syllogism and a complete inferential logic. If you have this much water, this much heat and this much fire in the stove, the egg will be cooked around this time. So now you might ask, why do we need to study this? We need to study this because we are trying to prove something that cannot be directly cognised, like the fire on the hill. That is not an object of direct cognition. But if you can see the smoke, then you can say that there must be fire.</p>\n\n<p>... because the Samkhyas believe in things being truly existent, they cannot use the word &lsquo;potential&rsquo;. They believe that purusha is truly existent, that prakriti is the wealth of the purusha, and that purusha enjoys the prakriti. Purusha, the atman, is truly and permanent existent, so they cannot even dream of talking about potential.</p>\n\n<p>Negating self-arising:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>There is no purpose in something already arisen arising again. What is already arisen cannot arise again.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>If you truly believe something already created could recreate, Production such as germination could not occur in ordinary experience.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The Samkhyas say that cause and effect have one essence, so they are saying that the seed comes from the seed, because they are one essence. This is another Prasangika method of attack.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Or a seed would continue to recreate until the end of existence &ndash; What [sprout] would ever cause it to cease?</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Here the Samkhyas will have the consequence that the seed will continue forever, so the shoot will not have a chance to arise. The fourth line is almost like an answer to a question, which is hidden here. The question, or objection, from the Samkhyas is that when a seed produces a shoot, the condition of the seed gradually changes because of things like water, earth, moisture and warmth and so the seed gradually becomes a shoot. Chandrakirti&rsquo;s answers: how can it destroy itself, because according to the Samkhyas, the causes and conditions are not separate from the shoot. If they are separate, their theory is that phenomena are other-born, not self-born.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>A sprout different from its instigating seed &ndash; with a distinct form, Colour, flavour, potency and ripening &ndash; could then not exist.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>In other words, he is saying you could never differentiate between the seed and the shoot, in terms of their colour, flavour, potency or ripening, because they are the same.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>If the self-substance of the previous vanishes, As it assumes another nature, what remains of its suchness?</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>When you make yoghurt, you start with milk. But when the milk becomes yoghurt, you cannot say that the yoghurt is a different entity from the milk. You will not find a shoot that is a totally different entity from a seed.</p>\n\n<p>Chandrakirti&rsquo;s negation here is in the form of a question. He asks them: if the previous selfsubstance, such as the seed or milk, vanishes into another nature like yoghurt, then what remains of its reality or suchness? He is asking them, what remains of the thing that they call self-born? If something is self-born, then that same suchness must remain, but they have said that it is already transformed.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>If in ordinary experience seed is not different from sprout, You could have perception of neither seed nor sprout. And, if they were the same, when seeing the sprout, You should also see the seed. Thus, your thesis is unacceptable.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Because a result is seen upon disappearance of the cause, To say they are the same is not accepted even in ordinary experience.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>So-called creation from a self, when properly investigated Is impossible, in suchness as well as ordinary experience.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Actually, all we need to do is delete the word truly existing, and what they say makes a lot of sense. For example, they are saying that the conch has a sound.&nbsp;But the Samkhyas want to create a god, purusha, which is a truly existent creator. That is where they went wrong.&nbsp;To be truly existent, a phenomenon must be independent and unfabricated.</p>\n\n<p>[Q]: If we use ordinary conventional experience to refute the Samkhya argument, then why don&rsquo;t we accept other-arising as true, since this is accepted by ordinary conventional experience?</p>\n\n<p>[A]: You will see when come to discuss the other-born. Today, our hero said that self-born is not accepted by ordinary people. But tomorrow, when we talk about other-born, he will say that ordinary people would say &ldquo;I planted this tree&rdquo;, &ldquo;I planted this son in my wife&rsquo;s womb&rdquo;: they do not accept the other-born. He will slip to the other side again! Ordinary people are like Madhyamika people: they are flexible, and they do not analyse. The only difference is that ordinary people just accept a certain reality, but the Madhyamikas analyse and find out that things are dependent arising. Ordinary people do not have a path, but the Madhyamikas have a path.</p>\n\n<p>[Q]: I think we are misrepresenting the Samkhya position. We are analysing things that they say do not truly exist as if they truly exist. It seems to me that they are saying that Atman truly exists. When they say that all these phenomena are born from self, it is just a linguistic convention of theirs. What they mean is exactly what you mean. Things cannot actually be born from the self; they are an illusion. It seems as if they are born from the self, and it seems as if they have a separate nature, but in fact, they do not. They are all the Atman. So, we have separated their argument, and we are agreeing with them while also trying to show that they are absurd.</p>\n\n<p>[A]: The only trouble here is the truly existing. They believe in truly existent Atman, whereas we do not believe in truly existent emptiness or dependent arising.</p>\n\n<p>[Q]: But they say that atman is limitless. It has no beginning, so it was not born.</p>\n\n<p>[A]: But that is self-contradictory. They cannot both say that atman truly exists and that it is limitless.</p>\n\n<p>[Q]: Can you explain how they understand time?</p>\n\n<p>[A]: They say that time is illusion; it is maya. They are only slightly different from buddhism, I think.</p>\n\n<p>... according to the Madhyamika, in order to exist, a phenomenon has to have a beginning, a remaining and an end.</p>\n\n<p>[Q]: That refers to relative existence, but for absolute existence, that is not necessary. In fact, it is contradictory.</p>\n\n<p>[A]: Exactly. For a Madhyamika trained philosopher, existence means birth, death and remaining.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>..&nbsp;As soon as we talk about existence, we are talking about birth, remaining and exhaustion. Then when we say d&ouml;n dampar drubpa, which means absolutely existent, when we say &lsquo;absolutely&rsquo;, we are saying that something is unfabricated and independent. Nagarjuna argues that if something is dependent upon something&nbsp;else, then it cannot be absolute.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>Malamadhyamakakarika</strong></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Neither from itself nor from another, Nor from both, Nor without a cause, Does anything whatever, anywhere arise.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>What does it mean to arise from itself?</p>\n\n<p>What does it mean to arise from another?&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>What does it mean to arise from itself, and from another?</p>\n\n<p>What does it mean to arise without a cause?</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/nagarjuna/\" target=\"_blank\">Stanford&#39;s entry on Nagarjuna</a> talks this passage in terms of cause and effect. <em>But from the above translation, it&#39;s not clear that Nagarjuna wants to talk only about abstract cause, and effect.</em></p>\n\n<p>(Can a Cause exist without an Effect? <em>Of course it can!</em>&nbsp;Although, the property of &#39;being a cause&#39; cannot exist without effect.)</p>\n\n<hr />\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n", "authorId": 1, "subject": "philosophy", "tags": [], "img": "", "summary": "", "lastUpdated": "2021-03-28 16:41:44.254571"}
