This is why when Buddhist masters talk about suffering, as in &lsquo;samsara is full of suffering&rsquo;, people cannot understand. For many people, the definition of suffering is something that is painful. So, they say, &ldquo;No, I am having a nice time here right now. It is not true that whole world is full of suffering&rdquo;. Whereas from a Buddhist point of view, even getting a suntan while having a nice time on the beach is a form of suffering, because your body is getting roasted and more wrinkled, and the clock is ticking all the time.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Madhyamika-Prasangika and&nbsp;Madhyamika-Svatantrika</p>\n\n<p>First one focussed on prasanga, or reductio ad absurdum =&gt; Just destroy opponent&#39;s views by showing that their view leads to absurdities.</p>\n\n<p>Second one also tried to give counter-arguments.</p>\n\n<p>...</p>\n\n<p>If a text does not have these four qualities, there is no reason to study and practise the text:</p>\n\n<p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">&bull; <strong>Subject:</strong> vakya, shes bya</p>\n\n<p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">&bull; <strong>Purpose:</strong> prayojana, dgos pa</p>\n\n<p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">&bull; <strong>Ultimate purpose:</strong> paramartha, nying dgos</p>\n\n<p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">&bull; <strong>Link:</strong> sambhanda, &rsquo;brel ba</p>\n\n<p>&quot;... there are texts that have no link. I think this is aiming at&nbsp;the first chapter of the Upanishads, which says that if you kill animals for sacrifice, you will attain heaven.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>There&#39;s Buddha nature in everybody, one that makes the person want happiness, that understands pain and suffering. Compassion can be developed through understanding of pain, if a person doesn&#39;t even understand pain, how can compassion be developed? A person who inflicts pain upon others definitely understands pain. <span style=\"color:#8e44ad;\"><em>[BUT HOW DO YOU MAKE THAT PERSON REALISE THIS?]</em></span></p>\n\n<p>Someone who understands non-duality has no such fixation on socalled goals, which is why bodhisattvas can continue to help sentient beings year after year, life after life. Since they are not goal-oriented, they do not give up. They do not say things like &ldquo;I can never cure all sentient beings, so I will not try&rdquo;. <span style=\"color:#8e44ad;\"><em>[THIS RESONATES WITH THE PRESCRIBED METHOD OF ACTION IN BHAGVAD GITA]</em></span></p>\n\n<p><em>[THE BOOK LAYS CLEVER ARGUMENTS SUPPORTING THE NEED THAT SOME BUDDHISTS FEEL TOWARDS TEACHING THEIR PATH TO OTHERS]</em></p>\n\n<p><em>[BUT TEHRE ARE SOME GOOD DISCUSSIONS IN THIS BOOK]</em></p>\n\n<p>When the Mahayana says a flower does not exist, it actually means that the flower is free from the four extremes: it is not existent, nor is it non-existent, nor both existent and non-existent, and not neither existent nor non-existent.&nbsp;. If you understand this, you will not ask questions like &ldquo;how can the Mahayana say this tent does not exist? I can see it&rdquo;. Chandrakirti will say it is not existent but also not non-existent. To our normal mind, &lsquo;not non-existent&rsquo; means that it is sort of existent, but then Chandrakirti tells us that&rsquo;s not it either. Whichever side you go to, Chandrakirti is there, saying, &ldquo;No, this isn&rsquo;t it!&rdquo; That is why it is called the Middle Way. And after all this, Nagarjuna says that a learned one should not even remain in the Middle Way!</p>\n\n<p>Madhyamika is about&nbsp;selflessness of phenomena, and not just the selflessness of the person.</p>\n\n<p>If we look at the framework for the whole of the Madhyamika, there are two things to be realised:</p>\n\n<p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">&bull; Absence of existence of the individual self: gang zag gi bdag med</p>\n\n<p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">&bull; Absence of existence of phenomena: chos kyi bdag med</p>\n\n<p>And there are two defilements to be eliminated:</p>\n\n<p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">&bull; Clinging to/belief in the individual self bdag &rsquo;dzin</p>\n\n<p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">&bull; Clinging to/belief in existence of phenomena chos kyi bdag &rsquo;dzin</p>\n\n<p>...</p>\n\n<p>&quot;If none of the six senses are there to perceive it, then there is no phenomenon.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>...</p>\n\n<p>Buddha said that &ldquo;form is like a bubble and feeling is like a bubble&rdquo;, meaning they are essenceless, that they have no substantial existence. There is no true existence, no reality in there. The Buddha also said that &ldquo;perception is like a mirage, and karmic formation is like a banana tree&rdquo;. A banana tree has many layers, and when you look at it from outside, it looks very solid. But it is all just layers of skin. As you peel layer after layer of skin, you end up finding that there is nothing inside. There is no real solid substance, as it is all made out of skin. This quotation also says that consciousness is like a magical illusion.</p>\n\n<p>...</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;So, in buddhism, ignorance has nothing to do with evil or misunderstanding. It is a hallucination, a mirage. Clearance on &quot;ignorance&quot;: it&#39;s not that there is something that you should know but you don&#39;t know. In fact, you know something that is not there. You&#39;ve created something [the concepts] that is not there.</p>\n\n<p>Dualism is also ignorance. There&#39;s no objective separate from subjective, there&#39;s nothing outside mind.</p>\n\n<p>... Chandrakirti says that even if people do not have this greater kind of motivation and if they practice generosity only with worldly motivations such as becoming richer, as long as they keep on practising generosity, then eventually they will meet a superior being. This also comes from a sutra, which says that aryas, which are non-samsaric beings such as bodhisattvas, are bound to go to generous people. They are attracted to them. For example, the Buddha&rsquo;s begging bowl represents that he goes to town to beg alms.</p>\n\n<p>For a bodhisattva, the motivation is that others can become happy, so naturally he gains his result more quickly.</p>\n\n<p>[Q]: Do bodhisattvas intend to make themselves happy?</p>\n\n<p>[A]: No, they do not. This is actually quite an important thing for Mahayana buddhists to know. If, for example, you are supposed to build a temple for your teacher, then as soon as you have the intention to build it, that pure intention, then it is already a success. Success does not depend on actually managing to build the temple and having a consecration ceremony. As soon as you have that motivation, it is the end of an act. But this does not mean that you should just be happy with it. Of course, you can accumulate more actions that are positive. But if the temple were to be destroyed by wind or an earthquake, a bodhisattva would have no regrets. Instead of giving up, he would build it again.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>How do we know whether a person has the qualities of a listener? Even an ordinary being may have repeated joy upon hearing the teachings on emptiness. The sign of such joy is that it will bring forth tears that moisten his eyes, and make the hairs on his body quiver. This kind of person has the seed for enlightenment, and can receive instructions on both the selflessness of phenomena and the selflessness of the person.</p>\n\n<p><em>[THIS, I THINK, HAS BECOME A THING OF PAST]</em></p>\n\n<p>The first kind of person is someone who already has an established philosophy, such as Hinduism or buddhism. This is why it is much easier to teach a hard-line Moslem or Christian, because at least they have a view, and then we can debate. It is so difficult to teach New Age people, because they are like honey. They paste things from here and there, they do not know what they are talking about and we do not know where we should be directing our arguments. There is a big difference between rim&eacute; (ris med) non-sectarian, and New Age. Rim&eacute; always tries to be as authentic as possible, and to have pure vision, whereas New Age people are always diluting everything, from classical music to Dharma.</p>\n\n<p>Like any other ideas, like science, economics and politics, Madhyamika philosophy is trying to build a better society, very simply speaking. In fact, if possible, the Madhyamika aims to create&nbsp;an enlightened society.</p>\n\n<p>The path and the philosophy are two different things. But&nbsp;without a philosophy, there is no dialogue to establish the path. There is no means or medium.</p>\n\n<p>Buddhist&nbsp;syllogism:</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;Mental formations are not born from self because they exist, like a vase&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">Mental formations&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;1&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Subject ch&ouml;chen (chos can)</p>\n\n<p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">are not born from self&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 2&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Predicate drubj&eacute; ch&ouml; (bsgrub bya&rsquo;i chos)</p>\n\n<p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">{1 + 2}&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;3&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Proposition/Thesis drubja (bsgrub bya)</p>\n\n<p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">because they exist&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 4&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Reasoning tak (rtags)</p>\n\n<p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">like a vase&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 5&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Example p&eacute; (dpe)</p>\n\n<p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">{whole phrase}&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 6&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Syllogism jorwa (sbyor ba)</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&quot;To the lord Buddha, Who taught us the view-less teaching, In order to destroy all views, I prostrate.&quot; This is actually the aim of the Prasangika Madhyamika, to destroy all views.</p>\n\n<p>[Q]: What about the Four Noble Truths? Surely, they are also a view?</p>\n\n<p>[A]: Yes. The Prasangikas accept all that, but only for the sake of others. But you might ask them, how could you say that you are debating with your opponents out of your compassion for them? If you do not have a view, then why do you say that you have compassion? Their answer is that they are not saying that they have established their compassion as logically or truly existing. They know very well that compassion is illusion. Yet, the Prasangikas talk about compassion the most; all is for the sake of other beings. And the fact that we cannot accept that they do not have a view tells us how strong our emotions are towards having a view.</p>\n\n<p>[Q]: When one attains enlightenment, there is no path, so what is more important? It is the path or enlightenment?</p>\n\n<p>[A]: The path. Without the path, enlightenment is boring! The path is what makes it exciting. There are three stages of attachment on the path: the first stage is you think you are not perfect. The second stage of attachment is that you want to be perfect. And the third stage of attachment is following a path to perfection. One mahasiddha said that our first mistake is to think that we need a path.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>It is very simple. Suppose that you ask Chandrakirti whether he has some drinking water in his house. If you are thirsty, and you really want to drink some water, he will say yes. But if you are a logician, and you are there to debate with him, then he will be careful and ask you what you are talking about. There is always a difference between the path, and establishing the view.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>There are two subcategories to &ldquo;Refuting objections to the Prasangika&rdquo;: based on establishing the relative, and based on establishing the ultimate. Relative: At times in this text, it will seem like the Prasangikas are accepting things. For example, they might accept that there is smoke, but they do not accept things for themselves. They are only saying that they agree in order for the other person to understand that there is fire. Ultimate: When the Prasangikas say they have no assertions, it is important to know that by saying this, they are not making another assertion. In this way, no logic can ever enter into this kind of statement, even though it is not a thesis.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>I am telling you this because the ideas of true and not true are the basis upon which we develop our philosophies, ethics, religions and everything else. For example, the Vedic religions have the idea that God is truth. Again, you can see here that the definition of truth is something that is not a fake. It is something that is unfabricated, something that has always been there whether you fabricate it or not, something independent from all causes and conditions. It is like the difference between magic and non-magic. For example, this tent is true; it is real, because it is not dependent on a magician. If a magician were somehow to display a magical tent, then it would be a fake. The magician would have created it, and it would be dependent on him. We would say that it was his idea, his trick.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>The Vaibhashika school in buddhism has extensively defeated the idea or notion of God, and shown that it is a fabrication of whatever the religion. For the Vaibhashikas, only two smallest&nbsp;things exist: a very small thing like an atom, and a very small particle of mind. This is why we call them Vaibhashika, which means &lsquo;proponent of discrete entities&rsquo; (bye brag smra ba). The Sautrantika view is very similar, although there are some differences. The Cittamatra school has extensively defeated these ideas of the Vaibhashikas and Sautrantikas, and they conclude that only mind is truly existent. Everything else is just an illusion.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Not created by itself, how can it be created by another? Not created by both, what exists without a cause?</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>According to the Samkhyas, there are two basic categories in the universe: purusha and prakriti. They say that the history of the world is the history of these two fundamental constituents, which is quite different from Upanishad thought. From this simple dualism develops a very complex set of interrelations between purusha, which is like the spirit of atman, and prakriti, which is like the matter of original nature. The nature of purusha is spirit; it is many spirits. It is being, consciousness. It is limitless, untainted awareness. The Samkhyas argue that the world is formed as purusha infuses prakriti, and thereby stimulates the three states of prakriti, which are called the three gunas. These are activity (rajas in Sanskrit), inactivity (tamas) and transparency (sattva).</p>\n\n<p>The gunas interact and play different parts in the development of prakriti. As prakriti is activated, it becomes buddhi, or intellect, out of which individual egos evolve. Individuals often confuse their ego with their true self, and liberation can only happen when the true distinction is understood. The true liberation is obtained at death, when the bonds between purusha and prakriti are dissolved.</p>\n\n<p>The Samkhya school also believes strongly in causation. This part is important. They argue for cause, effect and the indestructibility of matter. Scientists say something quite like this. It is known as the theory of existent effect, which means that the effect already exists in the cause of all things. So, in some mysterious way, the cause of something pre-exists its effect, although they are distinct. Consider a jar of clay, for example. The jar is the clay, but it is not the lump of clay.&nbsp;The basic idea is that what already exists cannot change, and what is not existent cannot be born.&nbsp;If the pot does not already exist there, then it cannot be born. So, no matter how a potter might try to make a pot, he could never create one.</p>\n\n<p>Even when a cook boils an egg, there is a complete syllogism and a complete inferential logic. If you have this much water, this much heat and this much fire in the stove, the egg will be cooked around this time. So now you might ask, why do we need to study this? We need to study this because we are trying to prove something that cannot be directly cognised, like the fire on the hill. That is not an object of direct cognition. But if you can see the smoke, then you can say that there must be fire.</p>\n\n<p>... because the Samkhyas believe in things being truly existent, they cannot use the word &lsquo;potential&rsquo;. They believe that purusha is truly existent, that prakriti is the wealth of the purusha, and that purusha enjoys the prakriti. Purusha, the atman, is truly and permanent existent, so they cannot even dream of talking about potential.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Negating self-arising:</strong></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>There is no purpose in something already arisen arising again. What is already arisen cannot arise again.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>If you truly believe something already created could recreate, Production such as germination could not occur in ordinary experience.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The Samkhyas say that cause and effect have one essence, so they are saying that the seed comes from the seed, because they are one essence. This is another Prasangika method of attack.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Or a seed would continue to recreate until the end of existence &ndash; What [sprout] would ever cause it to cease?</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Here the Samkhyas will have the consequence that the seed will continue forever, so the shoot will not have a chance to arise. The fourth line is almost like an answer to a question, which is hidden here. The question, or objection, from the Samkhyas is that when a seed produces a shoot, the condition of the seed gradually changes because of things like water, earth, moisture and warmth and so the seed gradually becomes a shoot. Chandrakirti&rsquo;s answers: how can it destroy itself, because according to the Samkhyas, the causes and conditions are not separate from the shoot. If they are separate, their theory is that phenomena are other-born, not self-born.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>A sprout different from its instigating seed &ndash; with a distinct form, Colour, flavour, potency and ripening &ndash; could then not exist.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>In other words, he is saying you could never differentiate between the seed and the shoot, in terms of their colour, flavour, potency or ripening, because they are the same.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>If the self-substance of the previous vanishes, As it assumes another nature, what remains of its suchness?</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>When you make yoghurt, you start with milk. But when the milk becomes yoghurt, you cannot say that the yoghurt is a different entity from the milk. You will not find a shoot that is a totally different entity from a seed.</p>\n\n<p>Chandrakirti&rsquo;s negation here is in the form of a question. He asks them: if the previous selfsubstance, such as the seed or milk, vanishes into another nature like yoghurt, then what remains of its reality or suchness? He is asking them, what remains of the thing that they call self-born? If something is self-born, then that same suchness must remain, but they have said that it is already transformed.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>If in ordinary experience seed is not different from sprout, You could have perception of neither seed nor sprout. And, if they were the same, when seeing the sprout, You should also see the seed. Thus, your thesis is unacceptable.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Because a result is seen upon disappearance of the cause, To say they are the same is not accepted even in ordinary experience.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>So-called creation from a self, when properly investigated Is impossible, in suchness as well as ordinary experience.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Actually, all we need to do is delete the word truly existing, and what they say makes a lot of sense. For example, they are saying that the conch has a sound.&nbsp;But the Samkhyas want to create a god, purusha, which is a truly existent creator. That is where they went wrong.&nbsp;To be truly existent, a phenomenon must be independent and unfabricated.</p>\n\n<p>[Q]: If we use ordinary conventional experience to refute the Samkhya argument, then why don&rsquo;t we accept other-arising as true, since this is accepted by ordinary conventional experience?</p>\n\n<p>[A]: You will see when come to discuss the other-born. Today, our hero said that self-born is not accepted by ordinary people. But tomorrow, when we talk about other-born, he will say that ordinary people would say &ldquo;I planted this tree&rdquo;, &ldquo;I planted this son in my wife&rsquo;s womb&rdquo;: they do not accept the other-born. He will slip to the other side again! Ordinary people are like Madhyamika people: they are flexible, and they do not analyse. The only difference is that ordinary people just accept a certain reality, but the Madhyamikas analyse and find out that things are dependent arising. Ordinary people do not have a path, but the Madhyamikas have a path.</p>\n\n<p>[Q]: I think we are misrepresenting the Samkhya position. We are analysing things that they say do not truly exist as if they truly exist. It seems to me that they are saying that Atman truly exists. When they say that all these phenomena are born from self, it is just a linguistic convention of theirs. What they mean is exactly what you mean. Things cannot actually be born from the self; they are an illusion. It seems as if they are born from the self, and it seems as if they have a separate nature, but in fact, they do not. They are all the Atman. So, we have separated their argument, and we are agreeing with them while also trying to show that they are absurd.</p>\n\n<p>[A]: The only trouble here is the truly existing. They believe in truly existent Atman, whereas we do not believe in truly existent emptiness or dependent arising.</p>\n\n<p>[Q]: But they say that atman is limitless. It has no beginning, so it was not born.</p>\n\n<p>[A]: But that is self-contradictory. They cannot both say that atman truly exists and that it is limitless.</p>\n\n<p>[Q]: Can you explain how they understand time?</p>\n\n<p>[A]: They say that time is illusion; it is maya. They are only slightly different from buddhism, I think.</p>\n\n<p>... according to the Madhyamika, in order to exist, a phenomenon has to have a beginning, a remaining and an end.</p>\n\n<p>[Q]: That refers to relative existence, but for absolute existence, that is not necessary. In fact, it is contradictory.</p>\n\n<p>[A]: Exactly. For a Madhyamika trained philosopher, existence means birth, death and remaining.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>..&nbsp;As soon as we talk about existence, we are talking about birth, remaining and exhaustion. Then when we say d&ouml;n dampar drubpa, which means absolutely existent, when we say &lsquo;absolutely&rsquo;, we are saying that something is unfabricated and independent. Nagarjuna argues that if something is dependent upon something&nbsp;else, then it cannot be absolute.</p>\n\n<p>...</p>\n\n<p>If people want to say that God exists or purusha exists, that is fine. Chandrakirti will keep quiet. The problem arises when they say they exist truly or absolutely. Existence just means that something has a beginning, end and middle. If you say that Jesus Christ comes from somewhere, or that God came from somewhere in the beginning, then it is fine. Nobody will argue. But if you say they are absolutely existent, then that is a big problem, as that means they are independent and unfabricated.</p>\n\n<p>....</p>\n\n<p>Many of the Madhyamika philosophers say that these religious people have a fundamental fear. Our fundamental fear, or insecurity, is that we find it so difficult to negate the notion of &lsquo;I&rsquo;. The great religions are wonderful when they talk about things like gunas, sattvas, rajas and tamas. Or like illusion and renunciation mind. But when it comes to the self, deep inside, then they change the name to things like purusha</p>\n\n<p>This is what I was saying before. If you are not careful, then Buddha nature could fall into this category. You have to be very careful, and if you present Buddha nature, it must definitely go beyond the four extremes.</p>\n\n<p>[Q]: But there is the notion of beyond existing and non-existing.</p>\n\n<p>[A]: Yes, in the path, you can imagine that there is a beyond.</p>\n\n<p>[Q]: And for some Christians, God is beyond.</p>\n\n<p>[A]: Then there is no problem at all, if God is beyond the four extremes. It is just a name &ndash; God or Buddha nature &ndash; what difference is there?</p>\n\n<p>[Q]: But God created heaven and earth, so you cannot say he is beyond.</p>\n\n<p>[A]: I told you that you have to be careful when defining the Buddha nature! Not many people seem to realise this. I have read so many new books that talk about buddha nature and it makes me feel like I am travelling along some kind of cliff that has no support at all.</p>\n\n<p>[Q]: What is the definition of Buddha nature?</p>\n\n<p>[A]: Buddha nature has to be beyond the four extremes. If God is beyond the four extremes, then there is no problem. Chandrakirti has no problem with anyone, as long as (a) absolutely, they accept that things are beyond the four extremes, and (b) relatively, things are left unanalysed. If you say that this is a tent, just leave it &ndash; do not analyse. That is the relative truth. This is a tent, that&rsquo;s it; just accept that. As soon as you start to analyse, asking whether this part or that part is tent, then the tent will fall apart, because then you are approaching the ultimate.</p>\n\n<p>This is his very beautiful idea. Absolutely, go beyond the four extremes, and do not analyse. Relatively, just do not analyse! That&rsquo;s it.</p>\n\n<p>[Q]: Do the Samkhyas accept that existence means birth, remaining and cessation?</p>\n\n<p>[A]: They have to, as this is what they are saying. You can always try to come up with another definition. I have classified all phenomena into four categories &ndash; find a fifth. And I have come up with three characteristics for the definition of existence &ndash; find another! Or find another existent phenomenon that does not have these three.</p>\n\n<p>[Q]: You will not find one in practice.</p>\n\n<p>[A]: It is impossible. This is why the Madhyamikas say only their philosophy talks about the true nature of reality, both relatively and ultimately. They will produce a definition, and wait for you to produce another definition or find a phenomenon that does not fit this definition.&nbsp;Defining existence as birth, remaining and exhaustion is not a thesis of the Madhyamika; it is a thesis accepted by their opponents.</p>\n\n<p>[Q]: It seems that we do not all agree upon precisely what we mean when we define &lsquo;existence&rsquo; as having a beginning, remaining and cessation. Without a proper definition, we just are taking it on faith. Since these concepts and ideas are not the same as ours, I think it is important that we struggle to get some kind of link between this very unfamiliar language and the language that we usually work with.</p>\n\n<p>[A]: Yes. If you have a certain faith in another type of existence, please give us a definition now.</p>\n\n<p>[Q]: Can you say that Chandrakirti is using that definition of existence because that is the way we proceed? As human begins, we would naturally assume that phenomena arise, remain and then disappear.</p>\n\n<p>[A]: This is what we are saying here. The Madhyamikas claim that they are the best at classifying and defining phenomena. And they will not say anything that requires any invention of devotion and faith; they will just talk about how it is.</p>\n\n<p>[Q]: You mean how we experience things as humans, not how it is?</p>\n\n<p>[A]: They are not separate in reality. Based on your experience, you then have to find out how it is. That is relative truth and ultimate truth.</p>\n\n<p>[Q]: But God can function and still be ultimate.</p>\n\n<p>[A]: When you talk about &lsquo;function&rsquo;, you talk about beginning, end and middle. The moment you open your mouth about existence, you will talk like that. The problem is that you think it is not what you are saying. This is what we call the essence of a religion. You always believe something based on faith, and you will talk about things based on faith.</p>\n\n<p>[Q]: Do the Madhyamikas accept the category of unconditioned phenomena like the Vaibhashikas? Like nirvana, for example?</p>\n\n<p>[A]: Yes.</p>\n\n<p>[Q]: Then that is another category of existing.</p>\n\n<p>[A]: For the sake of argument, they classify phenomena into composite and non-composite. You just want to put the Samkhyas&rsquo; purusha into the category of non-composite phenomena. But then it cannot produce. If you don&rsquo;t want to have the faults of the self-born that have been explained by Chandrakirti, then there are only three escapes: non-existence, both and neither. You will then have the problem that your purusha, or whatever you claim is selfproduced, is useless. It is almost like talking about the colour of flowers that grow in the sky. You can talk about it poetically for as long as you want. That is fine. Chandrakirti&nbsp;will not stop that; he will call it a fantasy. Actually, he calls all these theories something like the last leftover fantasies.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>Negating Arising From Other:</strong></p>\n\n<p>So, give me a definition of what you mean when you say &lsquo;other&rsquo;.</p>\n\n<p>[Answers from students]: Not self, separate.</p>\n\n<p>[A]: The Madhyamikas will be immediately happy when you say &lsquo;separate&rsquo;. But don&rsquo;t you have any other definitions? You must have been using this word &lsquo;other&rsquo; for all these years, and yet you still do not know what you mean?</p>\n\n<p>[Q]: But it can mean many things in different contexts.</p>\n\n<p>[A]: But I can always ask for the definition of a tree, and then I can ask for the definition of a sandalwood tree. Here I want to have a generic definition of &lsquo;other&rsquo;.</p>\n\n<p>[Q]: That depends on your viewpoint</p>\n\n<p>[A]: I cannot give you a viewpoint, as then it becomes particular!</p>\n\n<p>The Madhyamika definition of &lsquo;other&rsquo; is very interesting; one of its aspects is that it has to be present at the same time. This is so good! The Madhyamikas are quite clever, and they will get increasingly irritating now. Even though, as Orgyen Tobgyal Rinpoche said, all this is a result of&nbsp;Shantideva chewing the betel nut and sleeping, chewing the betel nut and sleeping in Nalanda University day after day.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Were something to be created based on something other than itself, You could have deep darkness arising from a flame.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Anything could arise from anything, As anything [that is] not the creating agent would be equally other</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>[Objection:] Perfectly capable of being created [by other], it is certainly called the effect, Capable of creating, although other, it is indeed the cause. Contained within the same continuum and created by its creator, It is not as if rice could sprout from barley.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>We are just refuting the other-arising in general.&nbsp;Here, our opponent is saying is that although the cause and result are different, our consequence of everything coming from everything will not fall upon them. This is because only a cause that can produce such a result can be referred to as a cause of a particular thing. For example, it must be something that belongs to the same category, the same lineage or the same continuum. For example, when you plant rice, rice grows and not corn. When you plant a seed from one continuum, it will not grow into something from a completely different continuum.</p>\n\n<p>[Q]: We are no longer talking about simultaneity because we are talking of a continuum.</p>\n\n<p>[A]: No, this is our opponent&rsquo;s reply to us. He says that although the cause and result are separate, the fault of everything coming from everything will not occur, because only a cause that can produce the result is referred to as a cause.</p>\n\n<p>[Q]: But something can only be other if it is simultaneous.</p>\n\n<p>[A]: Yes, but that is what our opponent does not understand, just as you did not understand when I asked you for the definition of &lsquo;other&rsquo;.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>[Reply:] Barley, lotus, the kimshuka flower, and so forth, Are neither regarded as creators of the rice sprout, nor as having that potential, Nor being of the same continuum, nor as being similar &ndash; In that same [fourfold] manner, a rice seed too is other.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>[Q]: Could you say that the rice seed has a special relationship to the rice shoot, as any other seeds do to other shoots, and the special relationship between the rice seed and rice shoot cannot be logically demonstrated.</p>\n\n<p>[A]: You cannot say they are related, because according to you they are separate. If you ask Chandrakirti whether they are the same or different, he will say they are neither the same nor different.&nbsp;He hates theoreticians, as they always make decisions, and he hates making&nbsp;decisions! He hates saying things like &ldquo;this is separate from that&rdquo;. Instead, he says that ultimately everything is beyond the four extremes, and relatively, if you make these decisions, you will always fall into a fault. It is as simple as that.</p>\n\n<p>I want to emphasise something here. Do not think that Chandrakirti and these important philosophers are having a fight about saffron and barley! They are talking about relative truth and ultimate truth, about what is fake and genuine, absolute and non-absolute. For example, the Vaibhashikas say that when you look at this flower, you see a white flower. They say that this is relative truth. This imputation comes from all sorts of influences. What is really behind this flower? If you pluck the petals, remove the stalk and cut it into smaller and smaller pieces, eventually you will reach the ultimate constituent atoms that cannot be divided any further. They say that anything that can be dismantled by mind or matter is relative truth and anything that cannot be dismantled by mind and matter is ultimate truth. This smallest particle is the cause of all these outer phenomena, and it is truly existent. I think this is like science. Now we can see what other-arising means: the entire world comes from these atoms.</p>\n\n<p>[Q]: But ordinary people use the word &lsquo;other&rsquo; as well.</p>\n\n<p>[A]: He says that when ordinary people talk about other, they do not really talk like theoreticians. If you are just an ordinary person, you will say, without any analytical mind, that the rice shoot comes from a seed. You could say that they are different, but farmers do not usually think like that, do they. Once you start to analyse, then you are no longer talking about the relative truth.</p>\n\n<p>My advice is that when you say &lsquo;other&rsquo;, it has to mean &lsquo;other&rsquo;. When you say &lsquo;same&rsquo;, it has to mean &lsquo;same&rsquo;. Do not just take the meaning for granted. This is what is called analytical meditation. This is the way to destroy our conventional thinking. Normally when we say that something is true, we just take it for granted. We never think about the definition of true. But the scholars and panditas do not just sit like this; they analyse. And this is how they attain enlightenment.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Since the sprout and the seed do not exist simultaneously, There cannot be otherness. So how can the seed be other? Thus, as creation of sprout from seed is not established, Reject this premise of production from other.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Because for &quot;other&quot; there must be some point of reference, then only we can say, &quot;this, and the other that is not this&quot;. If cause and effect exist at two different times, then there is no other [because at that time, we don&#39;t have the cause when we have the effect]. But if they exist at the same time, the effect is already there!</p>\n\n<p>[BUT, THE FRAME OF REFERENCE ACROSS SPACE-TIME IS THE CONCEPTION, THE IMAGE IN MIND, EVEN IF WE DON&#39;T HAVE A PARTICULAR INSTANCE OF &#39;THIS&#39;, WE HAVE IMAGE OF &#39;THIS&#39;]</p>\n\n<p>Although Chandrakirti does not believe in other, this does not mean that he simply rejects the idea of other! He accepts that we talk about other in the relative truth.&nbsp;But here our opponents are philosophers, and when they talk about other, they are saying that there is a truly existent cause, which is other than the result. So again, we always come back to the problem caused by the words &lsquo;truly existent&rsquo;.</p>\n\n<p>This is very important, because even in the Vajrayana, many people have a misunderstanding about union. They talk about the union of yin and yang, female and male energies &ndash; this is rubbish! It is the degeneration of Buddhism. The aim of these people is entirely different you know!</p>\n\n<p>According to Chandrakirti, if two things are both truly existent, they cannot unite. So, we have people like G&eacute;rard and Rapha&euml;le, who believe in unity and at the same time in diversity. They believe in diversity, as they believe in their own identity.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>This is very important, when proving that there is no such thing as other. If we have both G&eacute;rard and Ani Jimpa, then it is possible to talk in terms of other. Ani Jimpa is other than G&eacute;rard, she has certain attributes and G&eacute;rard has a certain passion for these attributes. And if there is no other Rapha&euml;le at that time, then there can be no jealousy of Rapha&euml;le when G&eacute;rard looks at such attributes of Ani Jimpa.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>[Objection:] Like the arms of a pair of scales, Rising and descending simultaneously, Creation arises as the creator ceases.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>[A:] If simultaneous, but this is not the case.&nbsp;When arising, still in the process of production, it is non-existent. When ceasing, although in the process of disintegration, it still exists. How does this compare to the movement of a pair of scales? And with no agent of creation, this makes no sense at all.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Our opponent will say, but you Madhyamika people talk about dependent arising? When you say dependent arising, don&rsquo;t you have to think about two things to depend on each other? But, like Nagarjuna, we will not have that kind of fault, because we do not believe in truly existent dependent arising.</p>\n\n<p>when we speak of a cause that is extinguished or exhausted, what is exhausting is not yet exhausted. You can only say that it is exhausted when it no longer exists. So, if it is exhausting, it still exists. So, how can you say that cause and effect are the same as a pair of scales? Equally, you cannot say that although the seed and shoot do not necessarily coexist at the same time, their actions of exhausting and arising can coexist at the same time. You cannot say that, but this is the how we think!</p>\n\n<p>Why is this impossible? It is because you cannot have an action that does not have a subject to act upon.&nbsp;There is no such thing as an action without a subject. Therefore, there is no such thing as cause and effect, despite the fact that this is how we normally think.</p>\n\n<p>During Chandrakirti&rsquo;s time in Nalanda, he debated so much in this manner that they wanted to beat him up!</p>\n\n<p>our opponent&rsquo;s example of the scale was not just made up by him. It actually comes from the Rice Seedling Sutra, where&nbsp;the Buddha said that one side of the scale rises as the other side descends. Likewise, as the cause exhausts, the shoot arises. But, this sutra needs interpretation.&nbsp;But this becomes difficult now, because there is a whole argument about which sutra needs interpretation, and which sutra does not. For example, in some sutras the Buddha says something like the hell realm is beneath the earth, but in other sutras, he says that hell is a state of mind.&nbsp;But even if the Rice Seedling Sutra did not require interpretation it has to be understood in the following way. The sutra is not aiming to establish other-arising. Nor is it interested in established a truly existent arising. It is talking about dependent arising, with the seed depending on the shoot and the shoot depending on the seed. That is all it is talking about, and comparing it to the way that in any given moment, the ascending of one side of the pair of scales depends on the descending of the other.</p>\n\n<p>In conclusion, there is no other if cause and effect are in two different times. And there is no arising if they are in the same time. With that, we have finished with the refutation of genesis from other in terms of time.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>[O:] Eye consciousness existing simultaneously with its creators: Eye and [form] along with consciousness and [perception], [Does indeed] exist as other.</p>\n\n<p>[A:] Then what is the need for the arising of the already existent?</p>\n\n<p>[O:] It is not yet existent.</p>\n\n<p>[A:] In that case, the defects have already been explained.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>In general, it is too complicated to prove that things like cause and effect exist at the same time. But things like an eye-consciousness and the object of vision exist at the same time. Likewise, feeling/touching exists at the same time as the object felt. In addition, the tree that I am looking at, my idea of the tree, and my eye are separate. They are different. So, these kinds of cause and effect coexist at the same time, but the idea of the tree in my mind (the effect) comes from the tree out there (the cause). As you can see, here they are still trying to prove that there is other-arising.</p>\n\n<p>According to our opponent, the cause of the eye perception, such as the tree, is there at the same time as its effect, which is the eye perception. But if the tree is separate from the eye consciousness and the understanding of the tree, then the eye consciousness and the understanding of the tree must already exist. And if it already exists, then why look? Why watch? Why go around and have a sightseeing tour around a beautiful place, because the result, the eye consciousness, already exists! The problem arises when they say it is truly existent. If they did not accept a truly existent other cause, then even scientists would be fine!</p>\n\n<p>As long as the opponent is saying that the result is separate from the object but exists at the same time, then why look or listen? The object is already there, whether it exists outside or inside. So,&nbsp;to get around this refutation, now our opponent changes his argument and says, fine, the effect does not exist yet. In reply, Chandrakirti again says, why look? There is no point looking at the cause, because you have just said that the effect does not exist!</p>\n\n<p>[Q]: Are you speaking in terms of time or space?</p>\n\n<p>[A]: Both. Chandrakirti does not care about time or space. All he wants to do is defeat the notion of truly existent arising. In this case, we are talking about simultaneous existence, so we are speaking in terms of time. If the effect exists simultaneously with the cause, you do not have to look &ndash; it is already there.</p>\n\n<p>[Q]: Can you explain further, why we do not need to look at the object?</p>\n\n<p>[A]: We do not need to look at the object because the result of our looking is already there. Our opponents have said that cause and effect are simultaneous. These arguments are very simple, and although we may think that all this should be complicated, it is not! This is why I told you earlier that the Buddha is so compassionate. Reality is very simple, but we make it difficult. So, he has to surrender to us and make the path difficult! You asked for it, you know!</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>If a creator is the cause of creating something other, Is [the effect] existent? Non-existent? Or both? Or neither? If existent, why a producer. If non-existent, what is created? If both, or neither, what could create it?</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>For example, an Atman, a god or an atom is the cause that produces other mayas, other illusions. If this is what they are saying, then Chandrakirti asks them four questions.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Firstly, does this cause have a result? This is a very fundamental logic of their position. First comes God the creator, and then comes the creation. Indirectly, we are saying that it is almost thanks to the creation that God can be referred to as the creator of this creation. This is not a stupid question because until something has a result it cannot be a cause. Until somebody has a son, he does not become a father. This is why we are asking whether the cause has a result. If it does, then why produce? It already has a result!</p>\n\n<p>If it does not, then what is being caused? Why is it referred to as a cause? If the result is both existent and non-existent, then both faults will occur. And if it is neither, then you cannot have a result. If there is no existence and no non-existence, then there is no such thing as the negation of existence and non-existence either. So, why do you worry about something producing something?</p>\n\n<p>[Q]: So we should not talk about cause and effect?</p>\n\n<p>[A]: Not while we are talking about the ultimate, nor during the relative truth. It does not exist in the relative truth, because relatively people do not think like that. In the relative truth, a farmer plants rice, it grows, and then he harvests it at harvest time. That&rsquo;s it! They do not think so much. In India, a cowherd is considered the worst and most stupid, but Chandrakirti places them above the Cittamatra school. He does this because he says that the Cittamatra school have unnecessary and ridiculous defilements that they have created by theory, which the cowherd does not have.</p>\n\n<p>[Q]: This is because the cowherd does not seek a justification for relative truth, and that is the error of the philosophical schools. The cowherd does not seek absolute justification of his relative view.</p>\n\n<p>[A]: That is right. The only time he seeks justification is with his wife, when the cows are out of the boundary or something.</p>\n\n<p>[Q]: Chandrakirti is criticising his opponents precisely because they take the whole process of causality and elevate it into some kind of theory, but they do not make a distinction between relative and absolute truth.</p>\n\n<p>[A]: Chandrakirti is always bragging that the Prasangikas are the only ones who really talk about causality, the relationship between cause and effect. I think it is true. If you want to be non-religious and a non-philosopher, then this is what you should study. Chandrakirti does not believe in philosophy. His belief is: in the ultimate truth, go beyond four extremes. In the relative truth, do not analyse. That&rsquo;s it!</p>\n\n<p>[Q]: Is the aim of his view to abandon all philosophical views?</p>\n\n<p>[A]: Yes. &ldquo;I prostrate myself in front of Gautama who has rejected all opinions&rdquo;. The Buddha had no opinions. He was considered a revolutionary in India, because until he came, everyone had an opinion. And in addition, he broke the rule of caste, savadharma, because he was born a kshatriya, a warrior, but he decided to become a Brahmin. And it worked for him. By contrast, the other Hindus said that only Brahmins can be Brahmins, and warriors can only perform warriors&rsquo; duties. But he decided that he could do it. Mahavira, the founder of the Jain school, was another revolutionary, another incredible man. However, from the buddhist point of view, the Jains are eternalists.</p>\n\n<p>In some of the big buddhist schools in Tibet, they have slogans like &ldquo;I pay homage to Gautama who has rejected all views&rdquo; written right on top of the door, right as you enter the main shrine. They talk about how the monks should study the Madhyamika view, Chandrakirti, buddhist pramana and all of that. But at the end, it says that after all of these studies, you should get rid of all of them.</p>\n\n<p><em>[WITTGENSTEIN SAID THE SIMILAR THING]</em></p>\n\n<p>[Q]: There is no need to say that just because one should not analyse on the relative level that one should not be discerning?</p>\n\n<p>[A]: That is not this kind of analysis. For clarity, I should say philosophical analysis.</p>\n\n<p>[Q]: Didn&rsquo;t you analyse when you decided to follow buddhism?</p>\n\n<p>[A]: Yes, I analysed and I thought Vajrayana is best. My mind is always analysing something!</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>[O:] Whoever holds a normal viewpoint, accepts ordinary experience as valid, What is the need here for analytical view? Creation from other is commonly accepted. Therefore, creation from other exist. What need for reasoning?</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>They remind us that we say we are Madhyamikas who accept the ordinary point of view. But now they are telling us that we are contradicting ordinary experience, because ordinary people accept other-arising.</p>\n\n<p>Firstly, Chandrakirti did not say that ordinary experience is valid; he just said that he would accept it. There is an important difference! He merely accepts it. For example, he accepts that there is a dream, and he knows that you can wake up from this dream if you try. The problem arises if you say that any of this is truly existent when you wake up.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Madhyamika way of defining the two truths is very much from the subject&rsquo;s point of view. It is very important to realise that when we talk about two truths, we are not talking about two separate entities. We are talking about two separate ways of looking at it: one with a deceptive or defective subject, and one without.</p>\n\n<p>Let us suppose that you have an emotion such as anger, and you see someone nasty. If you think you are seeing someone nasty out of your anger &ndash; ah! &ndash; Then you are a small-time meditator. Strictly speaking, even things like devotion and compassion, which we praise so much, are defects. I am sorry to say this, but they are defects! This is why Dharmakirti said, &ldquo;Path is the ultimate delusion&rdquo;. Nevertheless, based on the philosophy that you accept relative truth as relative truth, it can still be a path. But if you think that the relative truth is the ultimate truth, then everything becomes a hindrance.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>These four views, which are known as the four great seals or the four mudras, are:</p>\n\n<p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">&bull; All compounded things are impermanent</p>\n\n<p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">&bull; All emotions are pain</p>\n\n<p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">&bull; All phenomena do not have inherently existent self</p>\n\n<p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">&bull; Enlightenment is beyond extremes</p>\n\n<p>MMK is about the third of these.</p>\n\n<p>There are many ways in which we can establish this third view, ten of which are described in the Dashabhumika&nbsp;Sutra (see &ldquo;the ten equalities&rdquo;, p.73). But here, in the Madhyamika, we will concentrate on ky&eacute;wa mepa (skye ba med pa), no arising: &lsquo;all phenomena are equally without origination, or without arising&rsquo;.</p>\n\n<p>By studying and contemplating this kind of view, we can prove that everything that we think and everything that the world thinks is wrong. That is the whole purpose of these studies, to prove that everything that we think is wrong!</p>\n\n<p>Jigme Lingpa, the great Nyingmapa master, said shets&eacute; nangal, samts&eacute; tr&uuml;lpa (bshad tshad nang rgal, bsam tshad &rsquo;khrul pa), &ldquo;As soon as we talk, as soon as we utter words from these lips, it is all contradiction. As soon as we think, it is all confusion&rdquo;. This is the Prasangika view, which we are going to demonstrate here.</p>\n\n<p>Before we go through this, I would like to tell you one thing. What Chandrakirti is not happy with, so to speak, is when any theologian or theoretician, who might include scientists, makes an analysis and then establishes a cause by which one thing arises from another. That is what Chandrakirti does not like and cannot accept. If you say things like a flower grows from a seed, then it is all right. As long you just leave things as they are, and do not analyse them, it is fine. But, according to Chandrakirti, the moment that you analyse, the relative truth will collapse.</p>\n\n<p>The problem is that certain theoreticians, certain philosophical schools, have established that a particular cause is the cause of everything. For example, if you ask scientists, they will say that phenomena are made of atoms or small particles, or something like that. An ordinary cowherd would not say this. If you ask a cowherd where the horns of a cow come from, he will give a simple, unanalysed answer like &lsquo;from the cow&rsquo;s head&rsquo;. But a scientist would say it comes from particles, atoms and so on. Chandrakirti does not like this type of analytically established view, and this is what he is going to negate.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>[R:] All entities can be seen truly or deceptively, So, whatever there is has two natures: The domain of perfect seeing is suchness; False seeing has been termed all-concealing truth [by the Buddha].</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>... the ultimate truth is something that is perceived by the wisdom of sublime beings. And the relative truth is something that is perceived by ordinary beings whose subject is contaminated, or obscured by ignorance. I do not really like the word &lsquo;relative&rsquo;, because the Tibetan is k&uuml;nzob (kun rdzob), and rdzob has the connotation of &lsquo;obscuring&rsquo;, and I do not know if &lsquo;relative&rsquo; has that connotation. But as long as you know that, I will continue to use the word &lsquo;relative&rsquo; truth for simplicity of usage. With this, we have introduced the two truths according to the Prasangika Madhyamika, which we will now discuss further.</p>\n\n<p><em>[BUT, HOW CAN YOU GO ON WITH YOUR LIFE BASED ON WHAT SOMEONE HAS SAID. THIS TAKES US TO &#39;ALLEGORY OF THE CAVE&#39;.]</em></p>\n\n<p>When we make distinctions like relative truth and ultimate truth, we would naturally think that there must be a basis for making this distinction. There must be a basis to say that this is relative truth and that is ultimate truth. Since this is a common source of misunderstanding about the two truths, the question is what that basis is. There are four choices, and any one of these four bases for distinguishing the two truths is all right, whichever you choose:</p>\n\n<ol>\n\t<li>Mind.</li>\n\t<li>Tendrel, or interdependent origination.</li>\n\t<li>Contents of sutra, brjod bya.</li>\n\t<li>Knowledge.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Why can we use any of these four seemingly very ordinary bases? One might think the basis of the two truths should be something very attractive and holy, but it is very ordinary. This goes back to what I was saying earlier about the word &lsquo;termed&rsquo;, because the distinction of the two&nbsp;truths is only made for the sake of ordinary people&rsquo;s understanding. In reality, there is no such thing as two truths.</p>\n\n<p>I have to repeat this. There is no such thing as two truths existing somewhere outside there. I am stressing this because almost every theological or theoretical finding, no matter where it is established, has one fault. This includes theologians and theoreticians like the Vaibhashikas, Sautrantikas, Cittamatrins, scientists, philosophers, politicians, and so on. This is very important. Whatever these people decide about the two truths, they always make the distinction between relative and ultimate truth based on the object and its intrinsic nature or existence. The Madhyamikas refute this totally, and say that the distinction between the two truths must be made subjectively.</p>\n\n<p>for the Madhyamika, the two truths are distinguished subjectively, so they are based on you. This is very important. I sometimes feel that it is perhaps the difference between eastern and western philosophy. When western philosophy talks about &lsquo;truth&rsquo;, the distinction between two truths is made objectively. I think this is true for all western civilisations. What do you think? I am trying to provoke you a little bit here! [Q]: But we do not talk about two truths in the West. [A]: This is not true! Everyone makes the distinction between relative and ultimate truth, whether they realise it or not. In the West, there is great value and pride attached to being objective, whether it is in the newspapers or elsewhere.</p>\n\n<p>For example, in the West, the belief in a creator or a deity or a god, and the functioning of their blessings, is considered or established as relative truth. For something to be considered an ultimate truth, it needs to be established and validated objectively, for example mathematical theories or sophisticated technical tools. Only when it has been validated objectively is it accepted as an ultimate truth.</p>\n\n<p>The two truths according to the different buddhist schools:</p>\n\n<p>Vaibhashika: We will now briefly discuss how the other buddhist schools distinguish the two truths. The Vaibhashika talk about five bases, such as very small particles, and they say that these are ultimate truth. I think they are perhaps the closest to modern scientists.&nbsp;They distinguish the two truths as follows: they say that if something can be destroyed or broken down by mind or by matter, it is just a labelling, and it is therefore relative truth. For example, &lsquo;long&rsquo;, &lsquo;short&rsquo;, &lsquo;continuity&rsquo;, &lsquo;person&rsquo; and all these kinds of things can be destroyed, so for the Vaibhashika, they are relative truth.</p>\n\n<p>Sautrantika: The Sautrantika approach is very similar, with the slight difference that they distinguish relative truth and ultimate truth based on whether the object can ultimately function or not. First, they say that all phenomena can be divided into inanimate and animate. For example, forms like the five present moment senses and their five sense-objects, which are arisen but not yet ceased, such things ultimately exist. Again, the distinction between the relative truth and the ultimate truth is based on the object. In fact, you should realise that both the Vaibhashika and Sautrantika are saying that ultimate truth can actually be seen by eyes, heard by ears and tasted by the tongue. I think scientists would also say that the ultimate is something that you can directly experience with these senses, or detect through some technology, of course! Therefore, both the Vaibhashika and Sautrantika schools accept that just seeing the ultimate truth will not liberate you. Why? It is because the distinction of the two truths is based on the object.</p>\n\n<p>Cittamatra Now, the Cittamatra school is slightly more complicated. They talk about three characters or natures (which are explained in more detail on p.186):</p>\n\n<p>&bull; Labelling or imputation&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; k&uuml;ntak (kun brtags)</p>\n\n<p>&bull; Dependent reality&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;zhenwong (gzhan dbang)</p>\n\n<p>&bull; Ultimate truth&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; yongdrup (yongs grub)</p>\n\n<p>This dependent reality, zhenwong, is the mind, k&uuml;nshi namparshepa (kun gzhi rnam par shes pa), which is the famous alaya. This alaya is used as a base to distinguish relative truth and ultimate truth. On the base of this dependent reality, when the power of karma and emotions ripens, then you have subject and object. And although there is no true entity that is &lsquo;subject&rsquo; or &lsquo;object&rsquo;, you have a clinging or fixation that there is a separate subject and object, and the Cittamatrins refer to this as labelling. They are not saying that all of relative truth is substantially not existent, because although the labelled subject and object are not substantially existent, the zhenwong, the dependent reality, is substantially existent. Thus, even the Cittamatrins accept that certain relative truths exist substantially.</p>\n\n<p>Madhyamika The Madhyamika school is totally different. Their distinction of the two truths is never based on the object. The ultimate truth is the y&uuml;lchen (yul can), the subject or wisdom that knows that things are not arisen or produced from self, other, both or neither. Relative truth is a deluded mind that sees that things arise, are born or have a beginning.</p>\n\n<p>Now, we have quite an important question. Are the two truths one? Or are they two separate things? If you say they are one, there are four faults. If you say they are separate, there are another four faults! There is a big discussion about this, but we are not going to talk about it very much. For example, if the two truths were the same, then ordinary people would not have to practice, because when they see a flower, they would also see the ultimate truth, so then they would become enlightened. However, since we are discussing this, we have to reach a conclusion. One easy solution is to say that they are neither one nor separate. However, several scholars think that they are separate, but in a particular way which they then define. Indian and Tibetan scholars have concluded things can be said to be separate in four different ways:</p>\n\n<ol>\n\t<li>Separate substances: for example a flower and a pen.</li>\n\t<li>Separateness of existence and non-existence: If something exists, the thing that exists and the non-existence of that particular thing are not two different substances. But nonetheless, they are two separate concepts for us, and we cannot say that the existence and the non-existence of the thing are the same. So, there is separateness, but it is not the same as for flower and pen.</li>\n\t<li>Separate aspects of one nature: This is more from the aspect of labelling. For example, a vase is constituted through the action of a potter, and an intrinsic quality of that vase is that it is impermanent. Therefore, the vase itself, the action of its making, and its impermanence are three separate aspects, but not three different things. They are three separate aspects of the same nature.</li>\n\t<li>Separate names: The fourth kind of difference or separateness is for example, one person with different names. For example, we also refer to the planet &lsquo;moon&rsquo; poetically as &lsquo;the cool one&rsquo;.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>[Q]: When we speak of analysing, it is always very deep analysis. When we talk about the relative truth of scientists, they analyse a lot. Or when we say that from the seed comes the sprout, this is also analysis in a way, because we do not spontaneously know it.</p>\n\n<p>[A]: As long as analysis is being used to construct a philosophical theory, then that kind of analysis is what we are talking about and discouraging here. But when a farmer says that a sprout comes from a seed, he is not analysing in this way.</p>\n\n<p>[Q]: But if we learn to plant things, there is a certain science behind it. Is that considered analysis?</p>\n\n<p>[A]: Does it have philosophy?</p>\n\n<p>[Q]: No, it is science, techniques. Scientists are like clever farmers, and they presuppose causality in the same way as farmers do, because there are some things they cannot afford to analyse. They assume causality and use it all the time; otherwise, they could not do research or reach any conclusions. In science, there are two phases. They observe what happens, and then they construct a hypothesis about it, which they then try to prove or disprove. So perhaps Chandrakirti might accept the first stage, although he would not like that second stage, the construction of hypotheses.</p>\n\n<p>[A]: I think so.</p>\n\n<p>[Q]: I have some difficulty understanding the objective character of the Cittamatrin distinction between relative and absolute truth. Perhaps the Cittamatrins make the subject and object collapse in some way. Of course, they will not say that an object that is just an imputation can increase emotions. So when we say that this difference is objective, is it objective because the mind is object?</p>\n\n<p>[A]: Yes, in this case, mind is object. All that we have discussed today will help a lot during the next few days, as it will come up repeatedly.</p>\n\n<p>[Q]: In Buddhapalita&rsquo;s objection to self-arising, he says there is no benefit to self-arising. Why does there need to be a benefit?</p>\n\n<p>[A]: When he says there is no benefit, he is saying there is no point. If things are self-born, that means that the result is already there. So, where does the arising fit in? The whole purpose of arising is that something did not exist before, and then it arises. Buddhapalita is saying that if something is self-born, it is already there, because only then can it be self-born. Then what is the benefit of arising? It is already there! We are not asking about the use of the result, we are asking what is the use of the kyepa, the arising itself, since it is already there. For example, some people would say you are your daughter&rsquo;s mother. But if she was already born before you existed, then why are you called her mother? Your whole function, in being her mother, is in giving birth to her. Similarly, in the text, we are asking what is the use of recreating something that is already born, something that is already there.</p>\n\n<p>[Q]: Does something exist if there is no witness?</p>\n\n<p>[A]: The witness is the mind. When we speak of the &lsquo;birth&rsquo; of a phenomenon, we are speaking of a mind to witness this birth occurring.</p>\n\n<p>The two truths in philosophy and everyday life:</p>\n\n<p>these two truths actually occur in our mundane, non-religious, non-philosophical life all the time. We may not use the term &lsquo;two truths&rsquo;, but we are using the two truths every time that we value or measure things in our normal, worldly life. For example, when we talk about the &lsquo;fact&rsquo;, or say &lsquo;this is the fact&rsquo; or &lsquo;in fact&rsquo;, we are talking about an ultimate truth, although we are not using this word.</p>\n\n<p>We place more value in things that are facts, genuine, uncorrupted and unfabricated. For instance, we talk about the value of &lsquo;genuine&rsquo; Italian leather, and we attach no value to things that are fabricated, false, untrue or fake. We find this everywhere; for example, when there is agreement between two people, then there are two truths functioning. When there is disagreement, there are two truths functioning. When both people in a couple agree on the &lsquo;facts&rsquo;, we call this a good and harmonious relationship. Therefore, the two truths are also very individual in many ways.</p>\n\n<p>We have many ideas, and all these ideas are based on the two truths. There is no third truth. There is no such thing as semi-fake or semi-genuine, there is no in between. Things are true or not true. The difficulty here is that some of our ideas come from curious and inquisitive minds that are supposedly more sophisticated and logical. From this kind of curiosity and analysis, many groups of people from different religions and philosophies have reached conclusions about what is true. They all have their own idea of what is ultimate truth and what is relative truth. For some, as we saw during the refutation of self-arising, the ultimate truth, the thing that is ultimately existent, is the creator. Everything else is the play of illusion, and is not ultimate truth. This is how a path develops, because a spiritual path, for example, is there to prevent you from falling into all these false or fake areas. In that way, you can reach the ultimate, the authentic state. That is why there is a path.</p>\n\n<p>I would like to remind you that we are spending all this time distinguishing the two truths in order to answer the challenger in sloka 22. I think that Chandrakirti has already made himself very comfortable, and now he can answer easily, because he has said that his opponent is talking about the two truths objectively, which he is not doing.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Again, for deceptive seeing one considers two: That of clear faculties and that of impaired faculties. Perception by impaired faculties is considered mistaken, Compared with that of healthy faculties.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>For the Madhyamika, the findings of a defective mind, the sixth sense, not only include things like seeing a mirage as water, an echo as real sound, and a reflection as a real face. In addition, all the findings of theologians and philosophers are also considered findings of a defective mind, and so they are all invalid relative truth!</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Whatever the six unimpaired faculties Perceive in [unanalysed] ordinary experience, Are true for ordinary experience alone; other perceptions Are deluded in terms of ordinary experience.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Also in ordinary experience there are neither a Fundamental nature as construed by the The tirthikas (who are severely afflicted by the sleep of ignorance); Nor phenomena such as illusions and mirages.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>What is seen by someone with dimmed eyesight, Cannot contradict what is seen by someone with good eyesight. Likewise, a mind lacking immaculate wisdom, Cannot contradict a mind possessing immaculate wisdom.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Our challenger in sloka 22 said we accept ordinary experience as relative truth, and therefore we have to accept other-arising because ordinary people accept other-arising. As an answer to this, Chandrakirti has explained the two truths, and then the two kinds of relative truth, as an example. And now he is pointing out that a defective perception cannot refute a perception that is not defective. He is saying that the perception of ordinary people is defective, so they cannot refute the perception of sublime beings.</p>\n\n<p>When we talk about true and false relative, we were talking more from the point of view of ordinary people. For example, a yellow conch is false relative, and a white conch is true relative. Now, the question is, how would the distinction between these two relative truths be made by a sublime being. For a sublime being, there is no distinction between true and false relative. Both are relative truths, because although both jaundice and ignorance delude a jaundiced person, someone without jaundice is nevertheless ignorant. The white conch that he sees is also relative truth, so there is no distinction.</p>\n\n<p>But, from the sublime being&rsquo;s point of view, there is a distinction between what is called relative truth and conventional truth. The yellow conch and the white conch are both relative truths from the sublime being&rsquo;s point of view, but the yellow conch is not conventional truth. This is the distinction. This is because we usually use conventional truth as a method, and ultimate truth is the result of the method. But the yellow conch cannot be used as a method. This is quite important during the study of Madhyamika.</p>\n\n<p>In conclusion, if something is relative truth, it does not necessarily exist, but as long as it is conventional truth, it all exists. I think that if you can make sense out of this, then you will be able to unlock a lot of the confusion that gives rise to questions like &lsquo;if everything is emptiness, why do we have to meditate?&rsquo;&nbsp;Relative truth is a generic term, and &lsquo;conventional truth&rsquo; refers to those things within the relative truth that are accepted as valid or true.</p>\n\n<p>[Q]: What does &lsquo;conventional truth&rsquo; add to relative truth?</p>\n\n<p>[A]: Because conventional truth is something that can be used as a method to realise wisdom. It is the same as true relative truth.</p>\n\n<p>[Q]: If they are the same, why do we introduce the additional category of conventional truth?</p>\n\n<p>[A]: We will talk about this in detail later, but to satisfy this question now, I will tell you briefly. Here we are studying philosophy, and we have to study many different points of view. When we talk about two truths, we do not usually use the word tany&eacute; denpa (tha snyad bden pa), &lsquo;conventional truth&rsquo;. This is because we also like to include the &lsquo;false relative truth&rsquo; when we distinguish between &lsquo;relative truth&rsquo; and &lsquo;ultimate truth&rsquo;, so we do not want to limit ourselves by using the word &lsquo;conventional truth&rsquo;. When we construct the theory, we also divide the relative truth into false and true relative. But there are busy and curious students, who ask questions like &ldquo;where do things like the path, meditation and compassion fit it?&rdquo; Then we use the word conventional truth. In Tibetan, tany&eacute; has the connotation of a &lsquo;means of communication&rsquo;. Compassion and meditation are means to gain enlightenment, but they are themselves a means of communication, so they are called conventional truth. Now, we know that someone with jaundice sees a conch as yellow where someone who does not have jaundice sees a white conch. So, we might ask, would a sublime being categorise these as false relative truth and true relative? The answer is that a sublime being would not distinguish between false and true relative truth. From his point of view, both are just relative truth, and both are motivated by ignorance, even if one has a little extra ignorance. But things like compassion, meditation or even a white conch can be used as means of communication, so sublime beings categorise them as conventional truth. But sublime beings cannot use things like the reflection of a face in the mirror, sugnyen (gzugs brnyan), as a means of communication. Here Chandrakirti is really saying that sublime beings cannot use the findings or theories of the theoreticians as a means of communication.</p>\n\n<p>[Q]: When you talk of a defective subject, who is to decide who has healthy faculties and who does not? For example, if there were a mad man here who thinks he is an animal, we would look at him and say, &lsquo;no you are not an animal, you are a human being&rsquo;. That is because we as a majority see that he is a human being. But if you define healthy or unhealthy faculties according to a majority view, it does not seem very secure, because a majority view can be wrong.</p>\n\n<p>[A]: Yes, it is wrong.</p>\n\n<p>[Q]: But I think it can be wrong even on the relative level. For instance, a thousand years ago everybody thought that the earth was flat. But now we know that this is not the case, although we continue to perceive it as flat. But the flatness of the earth is not functional, because for example, in order to fly between countries, we need to know it is a globe. There does not seem to be any logical distinction between what is healthy and what is not.</p>\n\n<p>[A]: First, you should not forget that the conventional truth is part of the relative truth. Therefore, it is also dzob, impaired or obscured. Sublime beings accept that.</p>\n\n<p>[Q]: So does Chandrakirti accept it just as a sort of working principle in order to communicate with people?</p>\n\n<p>[A]: It is only for the sake of communication. Because things like bhumis, meditation, stages of the bodhisattvas are all dzob, obscured. They are all relative truth. When we talk about ultimate truth, we presume that we are talking about the ultimate truth, but as soon as we open our mouths, we end up (tsong ts&ouml;) talking about relative truth. This is how it is.</p>\n\n<p>[Q]: Is it because Chandrakirti has to accept the majority view in order to communicate?</p>\n\n<p>[A]: Yes that is about all there is. In tany&eacute; denpa, the Tibetan for &lsquo;conventional truth&rsquo;, tany&eacute; means &lsquo;communication&rsquo;.</p>\n\n<p>[Q]: In the third line of sloka 27, how can Chandrakirti be sure of his answer? Who will decide if someone is lacking immaculate wisdom? The opponent will always say that he does not lack it. Who is going to contradict him?</p>\n\n<p>[A]: Are you talking about the relative level or the ultimate level? On the relative level, it is easy. A person who has jaundice cannot refute someone who does not have jaundice.</p>\n\n<p>[Q]: That is not convincing. When you talk about wisdom, you cannot say &lsquo;I have wisdom but you do not have wisdom&rsquo;. It is not like knowing you have a disease and complaining about the suffering of the disease.</p>\n\n<p>[A]: First, we have to convince someone who has jaundice that they have jaundice. Only after that can we develop the theory. I am presuming that we have already convinced the person who has jaundice that they have jaundice. You say that you are not convinced that the other schools will accept that their perception is defective, but this is the argument that Chandrakirti is slowly building. All he is saying is that as long as they say that there is a truly existent something, it sounds like they have jaundice. That is all he is saying! Only when there is a case of somebody having jaundice can you talk about not having jaundice. If everyone has jaundice all the time, we cannot talk about a non-jaundice time.</p>\n\n<p>[Q]: It seems to me that there is no logic in sloka 27; it is just based on faith. At this point we are just assuming that there is a person who does not have jaundice, i.e. that there is immaculate wisdom, although perhaps the argumentation will come later to prove that.</p>\n\n<p>[A]: All along, we have been using a lot of logic, for example during the refutation of selfarising. Chandrakirti was not only using the quotation of the Buddha, so we are not only talking about faith. Immaculate wisdom is like not having jaundice. The reason that Chandrakirti has the confidence to talk about the possibility of not having jaundice is that there is a state of jaundice.</p>\n\n<p>[Q]: But for all those with jaundice, we are introducing the concept of somebody without jaundice.</p>\n\n<p>[A]: What is wrong with that?</p>\n\n<p>[Q]: It is fine, but we are waiting for the argumentation, and so far, it is a statement without any logical backing.</p>\n\n<p>[A]: If you have an illusion, the only way to tell you that you are having an illusion is by constructing a theory that there is non-illusion. Why would a doctor even go near to a person with jaundice? He does this because he has the confidence that there is a so-called state of no jaundice. That is what Chandrakirti is doing, like a doctor. The similar argument for you is that when the doctor goes to the person with jaundice, he is making a blind assumption by asserting that there is a state free of jaundice.</p>\n\n<p>[Q]: It is more the patient&rsquo;s point of view. Does the doctor really see something? That is hard to grasp. The patient has always perceived what is white as yellow, so he may not see it.</p>\n\n<p>[A]: Yes, some patients are quite stubborn, as we can see!</p>\n\n<p>[Q]: It seems to me that Chandrakirti is just being pragmatic. He is using a thing that works. Quite independent of the Dharma, people have an idea of what is normal and what is not, but from the point of view of a sublime being, the true relative and the false relative are equally false. So in order to teach beings, the enlightened being must use what they as a majority think is normal, so that a white conch as seen by a jaundiced person appears yellow but it is not yellow, it is white. If he had entered a world in which jaundice was normal, he would have used other examples.</p>\n\n<p>[A]: Yes, perhaps like a white conch!</p>\n\n<p>[Q]: Perhaps we forget the truth of suffering. It is a way of saying that I suffer, but I do not want to know this. I want to forget that I suffer. It seems logically impossible anyway. How do I know that the Buddha does not suffer?</p>\n\n<p>[A]: By knowing that suffering is not permanent, that it can be manipulated, destroyed, conditioned. That is what the whole of buddhism is about.</p>\n\n<p>[Q]: A sublime being does not think that a pillar is sick. But his wisdom includes things like a pillar that is sick</p>\n\n<p>[A]: He will only use it as a communication means.</p>\n\n<p>[Q]: Is conventional truth defined by its communication aspect, or by its utility for the path?</p>\n\n<p>[A]: Conventional truth is perceived by defective mind, but it is not invalid in the relative world. It has a certain function, which is used in the world by the majority of people, and that is how the majority of people get by. Everybody thinks that this table is a table, and it works like that. That is the relative truth and the conventional truth. But a minority of people who have jaundice think this table is a chair. That does not work. That is all.</p>\n\n<p>[Q]: What if everyone has jaundice?</p>\n\n<p>[A]: They do, a lot! If everybody has jaundice and only a few do not, then the whole system of the bodhisattva&rsquo;s way of teaching would be different. There is no problem there.</p>\n\n<p>[Q]: The conventional truth includes sutras, mantras and so on. Does it also include what ordinary beings perceive as being how the world works, without analysis?</p>\n\n<p>[A]: Yes, without theoretical analysis. More on this will come later.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Because of obscuring ignorance, the nature [of all phenomena] is concealed. What makes the artificial appear true The Muni named all-concealing truth. Thus, artificial entities are mere all-concealers.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Due to disease of the eye, hairs and so forth May be perceived erroneously. With a healthy eye, the actual nature is seen, You should know suchness in this way (here).</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>...</p>\n\n<p>Many scientists, philosophers, and theoreticians like the Vaibhashikas have tried to find the truth, and in their search, they have used many different kinds of meditation, reasoning, and logic. Nowadays, we also have things like microscopes and so on. These theoreticians all make many deductions about what is true and what is not true, in other words, what is truly existent. For example, the Vaibhashikas come up with two things: the smallest atom and the smallest mind. Now, I have been trying to be more sympathetic towards scientists, because I am not sure that scientists are really opponents of Chandrakirti, because scientists say that their truths are changeable, and not final. But Jigme Khyentse Rinpoche does not agree. He feels that whether they say it or not, they hold onto something as existing, because whenever they observe something, they are presupposing that it already exists already. In this case, sadly we have to include scientists.</p>\n\n<p>Now we come to some important words: d&ouml;ndam tenla bep&eacute; kab (don dam gtan la &rsquo;babs pa&rsquo;i skabs), &ldquo;the time of establishing the absolute truth&rdquo;. In all these processes of searching for the truth, like when scientists try to find whether the world is flat or not, or when the Vaibhashika think whether this gross form is true or not, they are analysing. And this time of analysis is what we call &lsquo;the time of establishing the absolute truth&rsquo;. I do not know if the academic world in the West has an equivalent term for this, but it is like what we are doing now: performing research, perhaps, or contemplation and investigation. Anyway, all these theoreticians try to establish the absolute truth, and they all find at least one true thing. But Chandrakirti is saying that after all this he found nothing. He found that absolutely nothing exists truly, and he did not even find &lsquo;nothing&rsquo;. Now if you ask him, what should we do during the non-truth time, the time that is not &lsquo;the time of establishing the absolute truth&rsquo;, he will say, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t analyse; just let it be&rdquo;. That is it.</p>\n\n<p>As we were saying, in the process of establishing the absolute truth, some theoreticians have found that phenomena arise from other. So, they are now accepting that there is not only an absolute cause, but there is also absolute arising. So, because they accept an absolute cause and absolute arising, they automatically accept an independent cause and independent arising as well. And this is what Chandrakirti is negating. He is not negating arising, but he is negating independent arising and an independent cause. He is negating unfabricated causes that are the findings of scientists and theoreticians, such as a god, a creator, atoms, and so on. If you ask Chandrakirti, whether or not he accepts arising in the normal mundane world, of course he does.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>If ordinary experience was valid, One could perceive suchness within ordinary experience. What need for Superiors? What need for the path of Superiors? Thus, to rely on the foolish is senseless.</p>\n\n<p>In no aspect is ordinary experience [ultimately] valid, Therefore, ordinary experience does not contradict ultimate truth.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>The phenomena of ordinary experience are accepted by ordinary experience, Any denial of these would be contradicted.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>An ordinary [person] who merely has sown his seed, Will exclaim: &ldquo;I created this child!&rdquo; People also think: &ldquo;I planted this tree!&rdquo; Hence, even in ordinary experience is there no creation from other.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>..&nbsp;Here there is another phrase that I would like you to pay attention to, matag mach&eacute; pa (ma brtags ma dpyad pa), which means &lsquo;unanalysed&rsquo; or &lsquo;without analysis&rsquo;. Ordinary people say those things without analysing. .. the last line says that other-arising does not even exist in the relative world.</p>\n\n<p>...</p>\n\n<p>[Q]: For example, when we say, &ldquo;he drinks a cup of tea&rdquo;, there is action and will. If a being has realised the non-separateness of other and I, object and subject, and thus realised the empty nature of things, whose will is it when they are performing an action? They cannot say &ldquo;&lsquo;I&rsquo; drink this tea&rdquo; any more, and surely, the cup has no will. So, whose will is it?</p>\n\n<p>[A] For an enlightened being, there would be no will. Realised beings do not have will from their own point of view, but from the point of view of devoted disciples and students, we can then say that they have a will and compassion for beings.</p>\n\n<p>Sloka 32 is quite important, because the Svatantrika&ndash;Madhyamikas say that other-arising should be accepted during the relative truth. But, for the Prasangikas, as long as there is arising, the arising must be from self, other, both or neither, and whatever theory you accept, that theory comes from analysis and logic. For instance, the Samkhya school in Hinduism accepts that things arise from the self. The three buddhist schools &ndash; Vaibhashika, Sautrantika and Cittamatra &ndash; accept that things arise from others. Jainism accepts that things arise from both, and Charvakas believe that things come from no cause. They are nihilists, and do not believe in causes. All these theories are established with much analysis. They analyse for years, until there is nothing left to analyse, and then they come to one of these conclusions. By contrast, the Prasangika-Madhyamikas do not accept theories that are accomplished by analysis and logic, like a theory of arising. According to the Prasangikas, if you analyse, there is no arising, let alone self-arising, other-arising and all that. There is no arising. But without logic and analysis, then there is mere arising, and the Prasangikas accept that mere arising. If you were to ask them, what is this mere arising? Is it other-arising, self-arising, both or neither? They will say it is none of these. The moment that you talk of so-called other-arising and selfarising, it is analysis. But, as Chandrakirti is saying here, when a father says, &ldquo;this is my child&rdquo;, there is no analysis involved at all.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Because a sprout is not other than the seed, At the time of the sprout, there is no destruction of the seed. Because they are also not one, At the time of the sprout, you cannot say a seed exists.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>If inherent characteristics were the basis [of phenomena], [Phenomena] would be destroyed through refutation [of their inherent characteristics] And emptiness would become the cause of these entities&rsquo; destruction. As this is absurd, entities do not inherently exist.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>.. this is sarcasm, a big blow for the Cittamatra school, because although they say that k&uuml;ntak, or labelling, is not truly existent, they say that dependent reality is truly existent. The Cittamatra is a Mahayana school, so they practice Praj&ntilde;aparamita, but since they accept something that is substantially and truly existent, then their emptiness meditation will become a destroyer of that phenomenon.</p>\n\n<p>In the Ratnakuta Sutra, the Buddha said to Kashyapa, &ldquo;emptiness will never make things empty. Things are empty from beginningless time&rdquo;. He also said &ldquo;whether buddhas were to come to this world or not, the nature of phenomena would not change&rdquo;.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Were you to analyse these objects, Apart from the actual entity of the absolute, Nothing enduring is found; thus the truth Of conventional ordinary experience is not to be analysed.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>So, our opponents say, even if we suppose that there is no other-arising on the ultimate level, you still have to accept other-arising on the relative level, otherwise there would be no relative truth. And if there is no relative truth, how could you talk about two truths?</p>\n\n<p>In response, Chandrakirti says that there are no two truths on the ultimate level. We only talk about two truths for the sake of communication in the conventional truth. In addition, words like &lsquo;relative truth&rsquo; and &lsquo;ultimate truth&rsquo; belong to the time of analysis. Ordinary people do not talk like that. This 35th sloka is almost like an advice. If you analyse all these phenomena, then anything that you find will end up becoming the ultimate truth. You will end up finding the ultimate truth, and you will not find anything beyond the ultimate truth if you analyse further.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>With the analysis of suchness Neither creation from self nor from other is possible; It is not feasible even conventionally. Now what happens to your creation?</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Now Chandrakirti says that all the reasoning and logic that he has just used to prove that there is no other-arising in the ultimate level can also prove that there is no other-arising even in the conventional truth. He is being a little witty here. He says that there is no self-arising and no other-arising, and on the last line, he sarcastically asks the opponent, so where is your arising? Then our opponent becomes a little annoyed, and asks a question in return. All right, so you, Chandrakirti, do not accept any arising in the ultimate truth or in the relative truth. So, in this case, what are all these phenomena? Where do they come from? When you look at a mountain, you see a mountain, when you listen to music, you can hear music. What are these things? How do they arise?&nbsp;</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Empty things such as reflections, Namely composites &ndash; are [generally] accepted. Likewise, from something empty, such as a reflection, Consciousness of its characteristics may be created.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Similarly, while all entities may be empty, They are fully created from [their] emptinesses.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Here Chandrakirti even brings help from ordinary experience. He says it is not just his view that things do not arise from truly existent causes and conditions. It is not only he. Ordinary people in this world generally accept empty things like a reflection or a mirage. When you look in the mirror, your face appears and you say things like &lsquo;I see my face&rsquo;. These results are generally accepted in the world, and yet everybody knows that a mirage is not truly existent.</p>\n\n<p>The last two lines of sloka 37 say, &ldquo;Likewise, from something empty like reflection, consciousness of its characteristics may be created&rdquo;. For example, if you are dreaming about a monkey and an elephant, you still have a very good discriminating wisdom, although it is a dream and not truly existent. You do not confuse the monkey for an elephant or the elephant for a monkey. That kind of consciousness arises. Similarly, the first two lines of sloka 38 say that although everything is emptiness, from this emptiness comes everything. Based on this kind of idea, things like visualisations in the Vajrayana work. If you had a truly existent form, you might as well forget it, because your visualisation would never work.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Because in the two truths there is no inherent nature, There is neither eternalism nor nihilism.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>None of these phenomena exist truly within the relative truth or the ultimate truth; therefore, they are neither eternalist nor nihilist. On the ultimate level, everything is like when you dream that a child is born to you, and then within the same dream the child dies. From the ultimate point of view, since there was no real birth of a child, the death of that child is also not real. And in the relative truth, everything is dependent arising, thus neither eternalist nor nihilist.</p>\n\n<p>Next, our opponent asks a very sharp question. He says, very well, if you really do not believe in these things, then what is happening when someone creates a bad karma, and only receives the result of that karma after one hundred lifetimes?</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Because [an action] does not inherently cease, And although there is no all-ground, an action is able [to produce a result]. A long time may have passed since the completion of an action, Yet know that it will still manifest a result.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Because there is no truly existent arising, there is no such thing as truly existing ceasing. Therefore, even without the connecting substance such as the k&uuml;nzhi, the alaya, we can still have the action of cause and effect. We do not need the alaya, because actions have not truly arisen, and they have not truly ceased. In the conventional truth, it is possible that we will experience the cessation of an action, and after many years, it is still possible to perceive a mere result of that action, also conventionally.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>After seeing objects in a dream, Upon awakening, a fool is still attached. Likewise, actions terminated and without self-existence, Still manifest results.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Actually, the text says that people may have a passionate dream about a beautiful girl, and when they wake up, certain fools may still desire the girl that they have never met. Likewise, actions that are not truly existent can still manifest certain results that are not existent.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>Malamadhyamakakarika</strong></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Neither from itself nor from another, Nor from both, Nor without a cause, Does anything whatever, anywhere arise.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>What does it mean to arise from itself?</p>\n\n<p>What does it mean to arise from another?&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>What does it mean to arise from itself, and from another?</p>\n\n<p>What does it mean to arise without a cause?</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/nagarjuna/\" target=\"_blank\">Stanford&#39;s entry on Nagarjuna</a> talks this passage in terms of cause and effect. <em>But from the above translation, it&#39;s not clear that Nagarjuna wants to talk only about abstract cause, and effect.</em></p>\n\n<p>(Can a Cause exist without an Effect? <em>Of course it can!</em>&nbsp;Although, the property of &#39;being a cause&#39; cannot exist without effect.)</p>\n\n<hr />\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n", "authorId": 1, "subject": "philosophy", "tags": [], "img": "", "summary": "", "lastUpdated": "2021-03-29 13:03:15.446962"}
