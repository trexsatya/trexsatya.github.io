I think this is aiming at&nbsp;the first chapter of the Upanishads, which says that if you kill animals for sacrifice, you will attain heaven.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>When the Mahayana says a flower does not exist, it actually means that the flower is free from the four extremes: it is not existent, nor is it non-existent, nor both existent and non-existent, and not neither existent nor non-existent.&nbsp;. If you understand this, you will not ask questions like &ldquo;how can the Mahayana say this tent does not exist? I can see it&rdquo;. Chandrakirti will say it is not existent but also not non-existent. To our normal mind, &lsquo;not non-existent&rsquo; means that it is sort of existent, but then Chandrakirti tells us that&rsquo;s not it either. Whichever side you go to, Chandrakirti is there, saying, &ldquo;No, this isn&rsquo;t it!&rdquo; That is why it is called the Middle Way. And after all this, Nagarjuna says that a learned one should not even remain in the Middle Way!</p>\n\n<p>Madhyamika is about&nbsp;selflessness of phenomena, and not just the selflessness of the person.</p>\n\n<p>If we look at the framework for the whole of the Madhyamika, there are two things to be realised:</p>\n\n<p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">&bull; Absence of existence of the individual self: gang zag gi bdag med</p>\n\n<p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">&bull; Absence of existence of phenomena: chos kyi bdag med</p>\n\n<p>And there are two defilements to be eliminated:</p>\n\n<p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">&bull; Clinging to/belief in the individual self bdag &rsquo;dzin</p>\n\n<p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">&bull; Clinging to/belief in existence of phenomena chos kyi bdag &rsquo;dzin</p>\n\n<p>...</p>\n\n<p>&quot;If none of the six senses are there to perceive it, then there is no phenomenon.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>...</p>\n\n<p>Buddha said that &ldquo;form is like a bubble and feeling is like a bubble&rdquo;, meaning they are essenceless, that they have no substantial existence. There is no true existence, no reality in there. The Buddha also said that &ldquo;perception is like a mirage, and karmic formation is like a banana tree&rdquo;. A banana tree has many layers, and when you look at it from outside, it looks very solid. But it is all just layers of skin. As you peel layer after layer of skin, you end up finding that there is nothing inside. There is no real solid substance, as it is all made out of skin. This quotation also says that consciousness is like a magical illusion.</p>\n\n<p>...</p>\n\n<p>So, in buddhism, ignorance has nothing to do with evil or misunderstanding. It is a hallucination, a mirage.&nbsp; &quot;ignorance&quot;: it&#39;s not that there is something that you should know but you don&#39;t know. In fact, you know something that is not there. You&#39;ve created something [the concepts] that is not there.</p>\n\n<p>Dualism is also ignorance. There&#39;s no objective separate from subjective, there&#39;s nothing outside mind.</p>\n\n<p>... Chandrakirti says that even if people do not have this greater kind of motivation and if they practice generosity only with worldly motivations such as becoming richer, as long as they keep on practising generosity, then eventually they will meet a superior being. This also comes from a sutra, which says that aryas, which are non-samsaric beings such as bodhisattvas, are bound to go to generous people. They are attracted to them. For example, the Buddha&rsquo;s begging bowl represents that he goes to town to beg alms.</p>\n\n<p>Buddhist&nbsp;syllogism:</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;Mental formations are not born from self because they exist, like a vase&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">Mental formations&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;1&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Subject ch&ouml;chen (chos can)</p>\n\n<p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">are not born from self&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 2&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Predicate drubj&eacute; ch&ouml; (bsgrub bya&rsquo;i chos)</p>\n\n<p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">{1 + 2}&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;3&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Proposition/Thesis drubja (bsgrub bya)</p>\n\n<p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">because they exist&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 4&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Reasoning tak (rtags)</p>\n\n<p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">like a vase&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 5&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Example p&eacute; (dpe)</p>\n\n<p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">{whole phrase}&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 6&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Syllogism jorwa (sbyor ba)</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>These four views, which are known as the four great seals or the four mudras, are:</p>\n\n<ol>\n\t<li style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">All compounded things are impermanent</li>\n\t<li style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">All emotions are pain</li>\n\t<li style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">All phenomena do not have inherently existent self</li>\n\t<li style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">Enlightenment is beyond extremes</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>MMK is about the third of these.</p>\n\n<p>There are many ways in which we can establish this third view, ten of which are described in the Dashabhumika&nbsp;Sutra (see &ldquo;the ten equalities&rdquo;, p.73). But here, in the Madhyamika, we will concentrate on ky&eacute;wa mepa (skye ba med pa), no arising: &lsquo;all phenomena are equally without origination, or without arising&rsquo;.</p>\n\n<p>By studying and contemplating this kind of view, we can prove that everything that we think and everything that the world thinks is wrong. That is the whole purpose of these studies, to prove that everything that we think is wrong! MMK is especially concerned with proving all philosophies wrong &mdash; it&#39;s against &#39;philosophy&#39;.</p>\n\n<p>Jigme Lingpa, the great Nyingmapa master, said shets&eacute; nangal, samts&eacute; tr&uuml;lpa (bshad tshad nang rgal, bsam tshad &rsquo;khrul pa), &ldquo;As soon as we talk, as soon as we utter words from these lips, it is all contradiction. As soon as we think, it is all confusion&rdquo;. This is the Prasangika view, which we are going to demonstrate here.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>Malamadhyamakakarika</strong></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Neither from itself nor from another, Nor from both, Nor without a cause, Does anything whatever, anywhere arise.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>What does it mean to arise from itself?</p>\n\n<p>What does it mean to arise from another?&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>What does it mean to arise from itself, and from another?</p>\n\n<p>What does it mean to arise without a cause?</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/nagarjuna/\" target=\"_blank\">Stanford&#39;s entry on Nagarjuna</a> talks this passage in terms of cause and effect. <em>But from the above translation, it&#39;s not clear that Nagarjuna wants to talk only about abstract cause, and effect.</em></p>\n\n<p>(Can a Cause exist without an Effect? <em>Of course it can!</em>&nbsp;Although, the property of &#39;being a cause&#39; cannot exist without effect.)</p>\n\n<hr />\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n", "authorId": 1, "subject": "philosophy", "tags": [], "img": "", "summary": "", "lastUpdated": "2021-03-29 16:58:59.015813"}
