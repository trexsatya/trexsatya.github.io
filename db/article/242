Now that the whole world is interconnected and interdependent, how should scarcity be considered?]</em></span></p>\n\n<p>&quot;Scarce&quot; =&gt; What everybody wants adds up to more than there is. There has never been enough to satisfy everyone completely. <span style=\"color:#8e44ad;\"><em>[How do the &#39;hungry&#39; ones weigh in, in this picture?]</em></span></p>\n\n<p>Just as soon as people make enough money to live comfortably, they want to live extravagantly.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><em>Alternative uses</em> of resources make Economics more complex.</p>\n\n<p>How much of each resource should be allocated to each of its many uses? <em>[And who decides?]&nbsp;</em>Every Economy has to deal with this.</p>\n\n<p>Countries with relatively few natural resources - Japan or Switzerland, for example - can have very high standards of living, if their economy are well adapted for allocating and using whatever resources they have.</p>\n\n<p>Economics is not about financial fate of individuals. It is about material well-being of society as a whole. <em>[Sowell uses this point to make another point, what if there are billionaires getting richer, society as a whole is benefitting from this]</em></p>\n\n<p>Prices convey the underlygin reality. For example, everyone would like to live in house near a beach, but there are not enough beach houses, and high prices tell this reality. <em>[Then how do prices change? - Because the underlying reality (involving many factors) changes. For example, if the beach is polluted, the prices may go down]&nbsp;</em>In order to get rid of unsold cars, manufactorers/dealers may cut the price of expensive cars, even it means taking a loss.</p>\n\n<p>Without really knowing why consumers like one set of features rather than another, producers automatically produce more of what earns a profit and less of what is losing money. <em>[Is this always good for material well-being of the society?]</em>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>.. as a general principle the price that one producer is willing to pay for the milk (or any other ingredient) is the price that other producers are forced to pay for the same ingredient. <em>[Is this always a good thing? Why am I focussed on &#39;always&#39;? It&#39;s not Utopia!]</em>&nbsp;From the standpoint of Economy as a whole, this means that resources tend to flow to their most valued uses. [Comparing this to] Soviet Union, for example, often had unsalable goods piling up in the warehouses while people were waiting in long lines trying to get other things that they wanted.</p>\n\n<p>The real cost of anything (for example building a bridge, or even watching TV) is the value of&nbsp;the other things that could have been done with the time and resources utilized there.</p>\n\n<p>When people are not restrained by the prices, the producers demand more than what is required for production. E.g. in Soviet Union, far more resources were used to produce a given amount of output as compared to a price-coordinated economic system, such as that in the United States.</p>\n\n<p>In a price-coordinated capitalist system, the amount of inputs ordered would be based on the enterprise&#39;s most accurate estimate of what was really needed, not on how much its managers coud make sound plausible to higher government officials.</p>\n\n<p>Marx and Engels apparently understood economics much better than their latter-day followers. Or perhaps Marx and Engels were more concerned with economic efficiency than with maintaining political control from the top.</p>\n\n<p>.. However, supplying electricity and food without charging prices led to a situation where people often did not bother to turn off electric lights during the day and members would bring friends from outside the kibbutz to join them for meals.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Quantity supplied varies directly with the price, just as the quantity demanded varies inversely with the price.</p>\n\n<p>Price changes guide people&#39;s decision through trial and error adjustment to what other people can and will pay as consumers, as well as what they can and will supply as product.</p>\n\n<p>An example: A sudden and widespread destruction of housing in a given area means that there may be not nearly enough hotel rooms for all the displaced people to get the kinds of accomodations they would like. The increase of price in this situation forces people to use less space for accomodation. If the government were to impose price controls under these conditions, then those who happened to get to the hotels first would take up more space and leave late comers without a place to sleep indoors in that community.</p>\n\n<p>When a crop failure in a given region creates a sudden increase in demand for imports of food into that region, food suppliers elsewhere rush to be the first to get there, in order to capitalize on the high prices that will prevail until more suppliers arrive and drive food prices back down again.</p>\n\n<p>In short, people tend to do more for their own benefit than for the benefit of other.</p>\n\n<p>In a sense, it is unfair when some people are unable to earn as much as others with similar skills, diligence, and other virtues. Yet this unfairness to particular individuals is what makes the economy as a whole operate more efficiently for the benefit of vastly larger numbers of others.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Can there be artificial shortage of products?</strong></p>\n\n<p>After&nbsp;2nd World War, US: The proportion of houses to people had not changed much, but there was shortage. Because prices were kept artificially low (Rent Control Laws), which allowed people to consume more housing than they would have otherwise, leaving less space for others in need. When rent control ended, housing shortage quickly disappeared. <em>[This is very interesting, but let&#39;s not forget that this is the only path leading to artificial shortage, if people somehow have got more money than others, they would still consume more space.]</em></p>\n\n<p>[Another example of this cause-effect scenario given in the book is from Sweden&#39;s rent control]</p>\n\n<p><strong>Do people give up the resources when the demand goes down for themselves e.g. when individuals get older, and their children move out, do they sell or rent the apartments?</strong></p>\n\n<p>Not if the income generated by selling or renting is negligible, which is exactly what happens under the rent control. <em>[Really? But wouldn&#39;t the effect of rent control be normalized?]&nbsp;</em>People don&#39;t feel the need to sell or rent for very small amount of money because of tradeoffs of efforts involved vs gains.</p>\n\n<p>In a free-market the prices would be based on the &quot;real value&quot;. [There&#39;s no actual real value] Young couples with a growing family&nbsp;are often willing to bid more for housing, even if that means buying fewer cosnumer goods and services. On the other hand, the priorities for older couple are reversed, they could do with less space and would rather pay for some other enjoyments. Artificial prices disrupt this order.</p>\n\n<p>Moreover, te chronic housing shortages which accompany rent control greatly increase the time and effort required to search for a new and smaller apartment, while reducing the financial reward for finding one. So older couple wouldn&#39;t bother moving into smaller aprtment and renting their large apartments.</p>\n\n<p>Rent Control also has influence on the amount of new constructions, the quality of existing buildings. No one would bother building new apartments, or maintaining older ones, if they are not getting value more than their effort.</p>\n\n<p>[Sowell gives examples of such effects in Washington, California etc]</p>\n\n<p>This actually results in real shortage of housing. [Sowell gives examples of England, Wales, France, Germany, Netherlands etc] And, even more, &quot;New investment in unsubsidized rented housing is essentially nonexistent in all the European countries surveyed, except for luxury housing&quot;. So, a policy intended to make housing affordable for the poor has had the net effect of shifting resources toward housing affordable only by te rich, since luxury housing is often exempt from rent control.</p>\n\n<p><strong>There are consequences of <em>bad</em> policies, even if the intention is right.&nbsp;</strong>And, policy makers don&#39;t pay the price for it, instead politicians who use such bad policies for their agenda get political advantage, all because of the lack of long-term effect analysis, short-sightedness.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Thomas Sowells book also reflects what happens when people try to solve one problem at a time.&nbsp;</p>\n","authorId":null,"subject":"philosophy","tags":null,"img":null,"summary":null,"lastUpdated":"2020-11-15T14:02:44.287+0000"}
