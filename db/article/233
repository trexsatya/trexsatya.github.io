Abstractions &amp; Models reduce the reality in order to make it comprehensible.&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>The map is not the Territory &mdash;&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alfred_Korzybski\">Alfred Korzybski</a></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>The map appears to us more real than the land. &mdash; <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/D._H._Lawrence\">D.H. Lawrence</a></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Keep in mind that reality could be completely different from the model that you have in mind.</p>\n\n<p>Also, the human brain takes leaps and shortcuts to make sense of reality/surroundings.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Abstractions, Models are useful if some conditions are satisfied. But remember that no model is free from conditions, and reality is not bound to follow certain conditions. Reality is much more chaotic than models can capture.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;All models are wrong but some are useful. -&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_E._P._Box\">George Box</a></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Probabilistic Models are nowadays used a lot, but it must be considered carefully that they are models that do not take a lot of things into account.</p>\n\n<p>However, in the case of reality if the territory is different from the map, does it really&nbsp;matter (because this map is all we have access to)? <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allegory_of_the_cave\">Allegory of The Cave</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Words are not the thing. The description is not the described. - <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jiddu_Krishnamurti\">Krishnamurthi</a>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Even if a model/theory predicts something correctly it&#39;s quite possible that the theory might be wrong. In natural sciences, it has been seen again and again for example <a href=\"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/331939278_MAXWELL'S_ERROR_AND_ITS_CONSEQUENCES_FOR_PHYSICS\">Maxwell&#39;s theories</a>. Experiments also do not confirm the validity of theories/models a hundred percent, because experiments are guided by theories, then the precision, the methods of detection, etc are not absolute, they keep evolving.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>2. Thinking from First Principles </strong></p>\n\n<p>By the effect of models and their adoption, we generally have some tendency in our thought, and we take a lot of things for granted. A historical example is that in his masterpiece <em>Principia,</em>&nbsp;Newton took time for granted saying that time is known to everyone so it doesn&#39;t need any explanation. When Einstein questioned about time, physics changed completely.</p>\n\n<p>First-principles are the source nodes of our knowledge graph. They are the things&nbsp;that we just know, we cannot (or don&#39;t have to) explain them in terms of other things. An example in philosophy is when Descartes doubted everything and tried to build his philosophy up from the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_principle\">First Principle</a>,&nbsp;something that cannot be doubted (for him it was <em><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cogito,_ergo_sum\">&quot;I think therefore I exist&quot;</a>)</em>, and other things depend on them.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>This is a very slippery path though. The question goes very deep if we follow this path, &quot;What&nbsp;is the most fundamental?&quot;. Even this sense&nbsp;of &quot;I&quot; does not seem to be fundamental. There are many scenarios when, by the influence of some externalities, the person&#39;s <em>I-ness</em>&nbsp;is no longer the same. Also, if you look at any scientific theory, it demands certain assumptions. Like, if you grant me that there is space-time such and such, then I can explain everything.</p>\n\n<p>The real thing about first-principles is that it tries to minimize the set of assumptions on which the models are built.</p>\n\n<p>Notice that children think from first&nbsp;principles more than adults do, because their navigation of the world is not guided by a firm model. With time we take assumptions for granted, and our navigation in the world is guided by the models that we have developed in various ways.</p>\n\n<p>People use First Principle Thinking to also guide their life as in why do you think it is this way rather than just taking it for granted, if you think it is not possible, why&nbsp;do you think it is not possible, rather than just&nbsp;believing that it is impossible because people say so.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>&ldquo;As to methods, there may be a million and then some, but principles are few. The man who grasps principles can successfully select his own methods. The man who tries methods, ignoring principles, is sure to have trouble.&rdquo; &mdash; <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harrington_Emerson\">Harrington Emerson</a></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>3. Thought Experiments</strong></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>&ldquo;All truly wise thoughts have been thought already thousands of times; but to make them truly ours, we must think them over again honestly, until they take root in our personal experience.&rdquo; &mdash; <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johann_Wolfgang_von_Goethe\">Johann Wolfgang von Goethe</a></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>First-principles challenge our intuitions and beliefs we have gathered from our surroundings by applying the process of questioning on the process, Thought Experiments challenge our intuitions by using an analogy, story to evoke some aspects of our thoughts that are missing due to complexity.</p>\n\n<p>Thought Experiments have been used again and again in philosophy and Science (natural philosophy).</p>\n\n<p>Thought Experiments can be used to experiment causal-chain (or causal network), or to ask paradoxical questions regarding solutions, or to demonstrate the complexity of&nbsp;the situation, or to explain something, or to attract attention to some possibility.</p>\n\n<p>Here&#39;s a list of thought experiments: <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Thought_experiments\">Wikipedia</a>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>4. Higher-Order&nbsp;Thinking</strong></p>\n\n<p>First Order Thinking is like just taking&nbsp;some observation to deduce something on its face value. Again this is because of the assumptions and our reliance on traditional approaches.</p>\n\n<p>Second-Order, Third-Order Thinking involves a deeper, more complex approach towards deduction (or any other form of reasoning). It also means thinking about thinking (meta-thinking).</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>5. Multi-dimensional Thinking</strong></p>\n\n<p>Sometimes it&#39;s hard to look at the whole problem and think about it, so it makes sense&nbsp;to reduce it into parts, smaller forms. Other times it may be that looking at the whole problem makes more sense.</p>\n\n<p>Sometimes, you could build the&nbsp;solution bottom-up, other times you could build the&nbsp;solution top-down. Sometimes, you have to mix them up.</p>\n\n<p>Sometimes, you just invert the problem and look at that (the opposite of the problem). Something like <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proof_by_contradiction\">proof-by-contradiction</a>.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>6. Critical Thinking</strong></p>\n\n<p>In simple words, critical thinking is this:-</p>\n\n<p>You observe something or experience something. You demand an explanation for this. You form (or hear from someone else) an opinion/belief/theory/model to explain it. You analyze how the model works (this could require that you consider the model&#39;s relationship with other models about other related things) and where it leads, what&nbsp;are its implications (on everything). You observe more, you gather more data, you test the model by making predictions (e.g. inferring something that you did not see before, but the model tells you that it could be).</p>\n\n<p>You doubt the model you have or someone else has. You modify the model or imagine a new, entirely different model. You repeat the same process.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>But, when do you stop? &mdash; That&#39;s not clear. Until you find the truth maybe! However, truth is a tricky thing, the whole enterprise of Science and Philosophy is trying to find it. So, when you stop depends on how much you are satisfied with the model you have&nbsp;at the&nbsp;time, and how much you are aware of the implications of that model, and how much you are willing to take the risk/uncertainty posed by that model. And, it also depends on the priorities. There have been only a few people in history which have spent their entire life&nbsp;incessantly working towards something, there are other priorities in life. Also, our minds have developed to take shortcuts at various levels. So, you cannot take forever to decide whether something is right or wrong at the moment. You act as per the understanding that you have at the time. However, when you get leisure time, you should stop and think about your models in the mind.</p>\n\n<p>Remember, <a href=\"\" reactlink=\"/article/230\">Logical Systemic Thinking</a> is part of Critical Thinking, but it is not the whole of it. There are things like Imagination, Creativity, Insights, Intuition, etc which we do not understand but nevertheless work in progressing our knowledge towards Truth.</p>\n\n<p>Scientific Thought is also part of Critical Thinking, maybe not the whole but a huge part of it. The&nbsp;lecture slides <a href=\"http://patrick.maher1.net/317/lectures/\">here</a> give a good summary of how Scientific Thought developed in history.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>7. Biases and Fallacies&nbsp;in Thoughts</strong></p>\n\n<p>Humans are complex beings, thoughts are also complex things. We don&#39;t know how thoughts arise. But one thing&nbsp;is sure that experience rules our existence&nbsp;(in terms of thoughts and feelings), and it&#39;s obvious that a person will create/process thoughts based on his <em>experience</em>.</p>\n\n<p>One more thing is <strong><em>Identity</em></strong>.&nbsp; A person assumes some identity, and whatever he holds dear becomes part of that identity.&nbsp;Thoughts revolve around that identity. In this way, it&#39;s very easy for any person to fall prey to biases that result away from objective thoughts and analysis.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://satyendra.online/article/230\">There are many fallacies</a> that are very easy to fall prey to, even for distinguished, intelligent people. And it makes sense &mdash;&nbsp;overcoming the fallacies not only challenges the identity but demands an investment of time and energy as well.</p>\n\n<p>What do we mean by <strong><em>objective</em></strong>? We don&#39;t know if&nbsp;there&#39;s anything truly objective, because ultimately everything boils down to analysis (or at least registration to the mind) by some conscious being (a person);&nbsp;but for the loss&nbsp;of perfect objectivity, we can say that something is objective if it holds true for everyone or at least a significant number of people, or it goes beyond a specific subjective experience, better if it can be repeated and tested somehow, better if it can be <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falsifiability\">falsified</a>.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>8. The Necessity of Thoughts</strong></p>\n\n<p>We think that&#39;s obvious, and there are various thoughts. In fact, there are various competing thoughts about big questions often on the opposite ends. Thesis and anti-thesis. Arguments and Counter-arguments.</p>\n\n<p>Critical thinking is necessary because thoughts often deceive us. We don&#39;t immediately reach to the better version of thoughts, that&#39;s why critical thinking is important.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>But, WHY IS THOUGHT NECESSARY AT ALL?</p>\n\n<p>We don&#39;t actually know how thoughts (which are responsible for the whole journey of curiosity, philosophy, and science) emerged in&nbsp;the first place, or why is it necessary. But one thing is clear, escaping thoughts doesn&#39;t seem possible. Most of the eastern philosophy/culture is dedicated to not only exploring the nature of thoughts (and other mental states) but also the absence of&nbsp;thought. Even the idea&nbsp;of no-thoughts is a thought. So, is it even&nbsp;possible to have no thoughts?&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Eastern philosophy says that everything&nbsp;is created by thought (mental concepts in general), that everything we perceive is illusive. But what&#39;s beyond? Is there&nbsp;anything&nbsp;beyond? Is&nbsp;it even possible to have no thought, no concept?</p>\n\n<p>This&nbsp;would be like the absence of any mental model. And obviously, it would be almost impossible for a person to survive (at least preserve this body) without any mental model. Or, maybe not, we don&#39;t know whether trees, for example, have thoughts or not, but most probably they don&#39;t, and they are still there in the world. But is it really possible&nbsp;to have no mental model?</p>\n\n<p>Animals must also have mental models, although their models don&#39;t include complex maps like ours.</p>\n\n<p>How did man&nbsp;even get the&nbsp;idea that the absence of a mental model is even possible, and that there&#39;s anything beyond what is perceived?</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>9. Stories, Analogies, and Understanding</strong></p>\n\n<p>Stories have been the traditional way of thinking. Even now, most people grasp things in form of stories&nbsp;only. In fact, stories are the only things&nbsp;that give a human&nbsp;touch to thinking, otherwise, thoughts are just computation.</p>\n\n<p>Also, it seems that extrapolation, exaggeration is also built-in in&nbsp;humans. That&#39;s why&nbsp;they are able to generalize (Induction) which is the foundation of knowledge. And if we consider this fact, it becomes clear why we have so much mythology.</p>\n\n<p>What about&nbsp;understanding? Do we really understand anything? What does it mean to understand something? Often our understanding&nbsp;is only a network of analogies. The models/ theories/&nbsp;maps&nbsp;are&nbsp;completely different from understanding. So,&nbsp;what is understanding &mdash; we don&#39;t really know. If a person (or, let&#39;s say an Artificial Intelligence agent) is able to prove some theorem by applying rules, does it mean that he understands the theorem? The&nbsp;closest thing that seems to tell something about understanding is that &mdash; <strong>it makes something useful for life</strong>.</p>\n\n<p>Analogies are helpful, but they are also not the reality most of the time. <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diogenes#:~:text=According%20to%20Diogenes%20La%C3%ABrtius%2C%20when,flat%20nails%22%20to%20the%20definition.\">Analogies can be useful but ridiculous as well</a>.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://satyendra.online/article/164\">Stories, Allegories, Anecdotes, Paradoxes</a> have been universal, across cultures, used language-based tools to transfer views, knowledge, virtues, etc.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>10. Modal/Categorical Thinking vs Spectral Thinking</strong></p>\n\n<p>If you observe philosophical theories, debates regarding human conditions, it becomes quite clear that most of the problems arise because we think in terms of modes and categories. While the fact is that things lie on a spectrum. Humans have compassion, intelligence, love, hatred, fear, etc something that animals do not have in the same sense. But not all humans have the same degree of those. Also, even animals have those to some extent. It&#39;s not Black or White (or even Gray for that matter). All qualities lie on a&nbsp;spectrum.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<hr />\n<p>So, with so many things to consider, how do we even make sense of anything. How do we accept new&nbsp;information?</p>\n\n<ol>\n\t<li>Discover - Discover new information by observation (of patterns, behaviors, historical data), by intuition, by imagination.</li>\n\t<li>Rationalize - Apply Common Sense, apply Science (domain-specific special knowledge) to theorize, verify the discovery, connect the dots.</li>\n\t<li>Internalize - Meditate on it, apply it in life, teach others.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Sources:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://fs.blog/mental-models/\">https://fs.blog/mental-models/</a></p>\n", "authorId": 1, "subject": "philosophy", "tags": ["prity=1"], "img": "", "summary": "", "lastUpdated": "2021-05-08 05:42:03.152468"}
