How did you get to know about &#39;moral&#39;? If your surrounding (majority) says something is moral, does it mean that it is moral? (<em>Of course, you would have to conform with the majority if you want an easy life, but is something really moral only because people say it so?</em>)<br />\n\t<br />\n\tDid we develop morality through&nbsp;evolution? If yes, how did someone get this concept of morality for the first time, how did it develop? How did someone get to the notion of sacrificing their own good for others? (Is it because of anticipation of a heavenly reward, is it because of ideological stance, is it because of some habit, is it because of some emotion?)<br />\n\t<br />\n\tIs morality just a social necessity? <em>(If yes, then is it okay to cheat, or commit any crime for that matter, if you are sure that you will never get caught?)</em>.<br />\n\t<br />\n\tIs being moral and just necessary for the satisfaction of the soul? (<em>If yes, is there really a soul, or it is just a formation of the mind?</em>) (What is mind, how does it form anything?) And what if someone gets the satisfaction of soul from something that is considered immoral?&nbsp;<br />\n\t<br />\n\tBy the way, What is natural? <em>(If we see more examples of something, is that natural?&nbsp;Example: Why would you say homosexuality is unnatural?)</em> Isn&#39;t everything (every possibility coming out of nature) natural by definition? What is nature? <em>(There are three realms in which it can be talked about: Physical, Biological, Psychological).</em><br />\n\t<br />\n\tWhat is good and what is bad? Is it just based on democracy (meaning, if 8 out of 10 people stand for something, does it mean that it&#39;s good)?&nbsp; Examples: nudity was not bad, then became bad, now again becoming not bad.<br />\n\tShould <em>Good</em>&nbsp;be measured based on the net resultant value of the action / intention (&nbsp;#Estimated_Profit - #Estimated_Harm). If yes, then <a href=\"\" reactlink=\"/article/178\">Utilitarianism</a> makes sense.<br />\n\t<br />\n\tWhat is naturally good &mdash;&nbsp;to punish or to forgive? <em>What is even natural (as this can vary from person to person)?</em><br />\n\t<br />\n\tWhy should anyone be <em>good</em> and <em>just&nbsp;</em>when we know that doing bad, injustice, and faking to be/do otherwise is far more fruitful than actually doing good and being just, even modern science shows the high dopamine level correlating to rise in power and benefits (even though it is achieved by injustice). (Is it really far more fruitful though?)<br />\n\t<br />\n\tWhere does this idea of &quot;<strong><em>Should</em></strong>&quot; come&nbsp;from? There&#39;s no such thing in this world... if we see from a naturalistic sense. There are things, organisms, events, effects, causes, but there&#39;s nothing to invoke &quot;should&quot;, where does it come from? The whole Theory of Evolution is based on a single formula, and there&#39;s nothing in that formula that has to say, why someone would think about morality. (<em>There is some direction offered by evolution theory for explaining how morality developed, but since morality is a psychological thing and theory of evolution has practical validity mostly from fossil records, it&#39;s hard to deduce anything clearly regarding morality</em>).&nbsp;<br />\n\tChildren develop sense of morality (<em>as obvious from them saying things like &quot;this is not fair&quot;</em>) in very early age of development without even having a concrete model of the world, how does it work?<br />\n\t<br />\n\t&nbsp;</li>\n\t<li><span style=\"font-size:24px;\"><strong>Does God exist?</strong></span><br />\n\t<br />\n\tDid someone intelligent create this universe, with some purpose in his/her/its mind? If yes, who created God? <em>(Does God even need creation? - If not, then why do we have this strong belief that the universe needs creation from God, why can&#39;t the universe just exist like God? )</em><br />\n\t<br />\n\tIf God created the universe and organisms (animals), why do we have so much evidence that evolution created animals? Is it possible that the universe also resulted from evolution? (But evolution is a mechanism. It&#39;s not the cause of creation. Also, there is some &#39;intention&#39; embedded in evolution itself. Why does life want to expand and continue life? <em><strong>Intention</strong></em> is definitely not a property of material, non-conscious things, or processes). [If you say that Intention is a human way of looking at it, there is no intention, then that does not mean anything, because everything seen/observed by humans is human-centric only]<br />\n\t<br />\n\tGranted that God exists, if he has a purpose, why is not so clear, why can&#39;t he just <em>incept</em> it in the minds of everyone? &mdash; But then what about Free-Will?<br />\n\t&nbsp; Is there free will, are we completely free anyway? Could he not have given proof of himself and still allow free will? &mdash;<em>&nbsp;</em>He has given proof, you just don&#39;t believe them.<br />\n\t&nbsp;&nbsp;There&#39;s a reason to not believe them, why don&#39;t we face difficulty in believing other things?<br />\n\t<br />\n\tWhat about the problem of evil? God is the ultimate form of good and God is controlling everything, so why is there so much suffering?<br />\n\t<br />\n\tIs God just a story (an ideal version of attributes we can think of e.g. beauty, justice, love, etc) <em>(maybe a useful story; it definitely has served its purpose in the history of humankind both beneficial and otherwise, it also has served as a mechanism of power, exploitation, oppression for some people)</em>? Is God just a projection of the psychological structure of humanity in its best image?<br />\n\t<br />\n\t<a href=\"#\" reactlink=\"/article/154\">See more on this here.</a><br />\n\t<br />\n\t&nbsp;</li>\n\t<li><span style=\"font-size:24px;\"><strong>3 Perennial questions</strong></span> (which founded many religions including the latest one Scientism), these come in picture when you believe that there is meaning to life:-<br />\n\t&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;How did we get here? Where are we going? (Or where do we need to go?)<br />\n\t&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Why are we here?<br />\n\t&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;How do we make the best of it?&nbsp;<br />\n\t<br />\n\t<em>Are people enjoying life without thinking about these kinds of questions far better? Why do we even bother asking these questions (even if these questions are fragments of the mind, why are they appealing)? Is it because the suspense is not good/beneficial?</em><br />\n\t<br />\n\tHow did it all start? Is it just a random occurrence in the universe? If we believe that &quot;yes, it is random&quot;, then it contradicts our whole existence. Because our life is not driven by truly considering things as random, if you truly consider events occurring in your life, it becomes difficult to even survive. Moreover, all the mechanism which enable &quot;knowledge&quot; for us namely &quot;Induction&quot;, &quot;Cause&quot;, &quot;Effect&quot; etc have opposite of random nature. Then it seems absurd that the starting of all this is random.<br />\n\t<br />\n\tHow did these questions appear in someone&#39;s mind for the first time, and why? Does it serve an evolutionary purpose? It definitely is not the best way for evolution.<br />\n\t<br />\n\tWhy does evolution have a purpose? Why is it necessary to survive and evolve? And what are the species evolving to? What&#39;s the end goal <em>(or rather, is there an end goal)</em>? How can this be random?&nbsp;It&#39;s definitely not just about the amount of life quantum (because intelligence doesn&#39;t help there, and simple reproduction would have been a much more efficient way). However, it is worth noticing that evolution is not necessarily about the best approaches, it highly depends on random mutation. So, maybe it is about the expansion of life, on this planet, and beyond. In living organisms and beyond, that is expanding life into non-living materials as well (in the direction of Artificial Intelligence and Life).<br />\n\t<br />\n\tWhy is it that we need to know ourselves? Why do we feel the need to know the universe itself? Why is it that we need to inquire into these things &mdash; inner and outer universe? <em>If multiplying the genes is the ultimate goal of evolution, and we are driven by evolution only, then evolution must have detected that these sorts of questions do not help in that goal.&nbsp;</em>Maybe, this is a side-effect, and those who think in this direction can&#39;t help themselves, or maybe they can. This tendency definitely has guided the evolution of intelligence.<br />\n\t<br />\n\tWhy is there anything rather than nothing? If this world is real or even a simulation, why is it there? How did it come to the origin, or why did it come to origin?<br />\n\tIs it not possible that there was no beginning to the universe, it just was there infinitely? Why then everything else that we see has a beginning and an end? <em>(Maybe we are evolving towards the future when we will be able to not only understand infinite, eternal but also experience them subjectively, like living forever??)</em><br />\n\t<br />\n\tHow should we live our lives, knowing that we are just a speck of dust in the infinite universe? What&#39;s wrong with the idea of just enjoying ourselves? <em>- After all, we seem to have been evolved to sense pleasure (This is true for all). Excessive/unrestrained pleasure? Full freedom? - Maybe these are not sustainable evolutionarily? - What if we enjoy ourselves in a &quot;restrained&quot; manner?&nbsp;</em><br />\n\t<br />\n\t&nbsp;</li>\n\t<li><span style=\"font-size:24px;\"><strong>Is it better to kill one (or rather let one die) to save many, or in other words save 5 lives at the expense of 1?</strong></span><br />\n\t<br />\n\t<iframe allow=\"autoplay; encrypted-media\" allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/kBdfcR-8hEY\" width=\"560\"></iframe> &nbsp;<br />\n\tIf you were able to go to the past and have the option to kill the child version of a mass murderer, would you do that, should you do that?

Do they not?)</em><br />\n\t<br />\n\tTo what level, should society take decisions over individuals? Who are <em>(or should be)</em> the participants in this decision-making? Rational people?<br />\n\tHow much freedom should individuals expect from society and how much responsibility should society expect from individuals? Society affects individuals and individuals affect (constitute) society, so how to balance things out?&nbsp;<br />\n\tWhy did society come into existence? <em>(Of course, it was a necessity for evolution)</em><br />\n\t<br />\n\t&nbsp;</li>\n\t<li><span style=\"font-size:24px;\"><strong>Is everything pre-determined?</strong></span><br />\n\t<br />\n\tHow about this: every conscious or subconscious choice can be linked to prior choice and other external factors (except for birth maybe)?<br />\n\tDo you really make your own decisions? How much is it influenced by external factors (including other people, society, parents, environment, etc)? (Given the fact that even your consciousness is an accumulation gathered from the external world, even your intuition is decided by some part of your mind and mind works by processing the information it gets from the external world)<br />\n\t<br />\n\tDoes Free Will exist, or is it just a delusion? What&#39;s the relationship b/w Thought and Free-Will? How does a Thought arise?<br />\n\t<br />\n\tIs there true randomness in the universe, if yes that might tinker the general flow, and introduce free will. Would it not? But, the question is, &quot;Is there true randomness?&quot;. Can Quantum Mechanics answer this whether there is true randomness or not?<br />\n\t<br />\n\t&nbsp;</li>\n\t<li><span style=\"font-size:24px;\"><strong>Is anything real, or everything just an illusion? Does anything even exist in physical form?</strong></span><br />\n\t<br />\n\tAre we living in a simulation?&nbsp;Are we living inside one giant brain?<br />\n\tAfter all when you dream, for a minute or two that dream becomes reality for you. So is it not possible that our life is just one long dream? <em>(No, because when you wake out of a dream, you don&#39;t have a wet body even if you were in the water in the dream.)&nbsp;</em><br />\n\t<br />\n\tIf a perfect simulation is possible, we would no longer be able to tell difference between real and simulation. Is it not possible that we are inside some simulation run by some futuristic technologist or that we are in a dream? (But the dreams that we know of do not have immutable laws e.g. anything can happen there which is not true in what we experience in our day to day life)<br />\n\t<br />\n\tCan something exist if there is no observer (of any kind, human or non-human)?&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/If_a_tree_falls_in_a_forest\" target=\"_blank\">If A Tree Falls In A Forest Paradox</a><br />\n\tAfter all, I know <em>(or think so)</em> that I exist, but what about everything else? <em>It all could just be in my mind</em>. You would say it can&#39;t be because what we see has so much detail...Really? you only see as much as you have attention for, everything else is just noise (or simply isn&#39;t there, like in video games!). Also, it&#39;s happening in your mind doesn&#39;t mean that anything can happen, there could be rules even if it&#39;s all just in your mind.<br />\n\t<br />\n\tA thing exists in nature, you are perceiving it and have an idea of it, your friend is perceiving it and has an idea about it, maybe a cat or a monkey is perceiving it and has an idea about it. If all three ideas are different (even in the slightest form), what is the actual reality of that thing? Is reality the same as perceived, if yes, whose/which perception is the reality?<br />\n\t<br />\n\tEven if there&#39;s something outside our minds, everything we know comes by the mechanism of the mind itself, maybe there&#39;s something outside the mind, but it&#39;s possible that it is not the same as we perceive it. An example, under the influence of drugs we see things that are not there, and they seem real because the mind believes it. And since the minds of everyone has common features, we all, or most of us, perceive the same things. But because we all perceive the same things doesn&#39;t prove that those things exist outside the mind.<br />\n\t&nbsp;</li>\n\t<li><span style=\"font-size:24px;\"><strong>What does it even mean to be living or alive</strong>?</span><br />\n\t<br />\n\tIf I drop a toy made out of some material which we do not consider normal and throw that inside a pond, sometime later scientists discover that or let&#39;s say someone sees that toy, and amazingly enough that toy reacts to your actions, it acts in such ways that you can feel connected to it, you are able to see emotions in it. But since I created it, I know that it&#39;s not living. It&#39;s just a Philosophical Zombie. Are we just machines, computing systems? What about AI Agents?<br />\n\t<br />\n\tIf we ever become successful in developing artificial intelligence and artificial life, how could we ever know the difference from the real, natural ones? I perceive people and based on the actions, emotions, etc we think they are there, just like I am. But how can I be sure that they are not just acting mechanically?<br />\n\t<br />\n\t&quot;I think, therefore I am&quot;, but about when I don&#39;t think, where am I? Is it possible to not think?
