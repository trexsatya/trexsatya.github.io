{"name":"Vedantic Philosophy","id":98,"content":"<p>Teachings of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Upanishads\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Upanishads</em></a> are called <strong><em>Vedanta</em></strong>.</p>\n\n<p>The schools of thought are: 1. Advaita Vedanta, 2. Vishishtadvaita, 3. Dvaita</p>\n\n<p>There are similarities with Platonic thoughts, however no reason for this connection has been evidenced. One difference is that Plato&#39;s philosophy didn&#39;t deal (at least in a serious manner) with afterlife.</p>\n\n<p>There are four <strong>Vedas</strong>: 1. Rig, 2. Yajur, 3. Sama, 4. Atharvana</p>\n\n<p>Veda Purva - deals with Karma, insists on following a religious life.</p>\n\n<p>Veda Anta - deals with Knowledge, tries to develop spiritually.</p>\n\n<p>Veda Purva:</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; - <strong>Sadhya Trayam</strong>: specifies three human goals, necessary for happiness and security which every human being seeks.</p>\n\n<ul style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">\n\t<li>Self Improvement</li>\n\t<li>Improvement of possessions. This can include one&rsquo;s house, material possessions, one&rsquo;s family etc.</li>\n\t<li>Improvement of set up. This includes the environment in which you live or environmental improvement. &nbsp;</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; -&gt; <strong>Sadhana Trayam</strong>: disciplines to achieve the above mentioned goals.</p>\n\n<ul style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">\n\t<li>Physical disciplines for the body that include rituals,&nbsp;</li>\n\t<li>Verbal disciplines in the form of Japa and Parayanam,&nbsp;</li>\n\t<li>Mental disciplines also known as Manasa Karmani often in the form of meditation&nbsp;</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The <em>human goals</em> possess DEFECTS inherent in them:</p>\n\n<ul style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">\n\t<li><strong>Dukha mishritatvam</strong>: These are goals that are mixed with pain. The goals give joy but are mixed with pain of acquisition, preservation and the pain of loss.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Atriptikaram</strong>: They never give total satisfaction resulting in perpetual struggle. It is like a gambler, even when he wins, he wants to play more and more.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Bandhatvam</strong>: They are all dependency causing goals. They lead to enslavement. They weaken an individual.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Not everyone seeks goals free of these defects.</p>\n\n<p>Vedanta says &quot;don&#39;t seek Brahman.&quot; &quot;<em>Tat Twam Asi </em>(you are that Brahman)&quot;&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>There are six pramanams or instruments. &nbsp;They are:</p>\n\n<ol>\n\t<li>Pratyaksha: perception,</li>\n\t<li>Anumana: inference, comparison and analogy</li>\n\t<li>Upamana: postulation, derivation from circumstances</li>\n\t<li>Arthapatti: non-perception,</li>\n\t<li>Anupalabdhi: meaning negative or cognitive proof,</li>\n\t<li>Shabda: word, testimony of past or present reliable experts. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>&nbsp;<br />\n&nbsp;<br />\n<strong>Nidhidhyasanam:</strong> &nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>It is Vedantic meditation. It is internalizing the teaching by dwelling on the doubt free knowledge in any form such as reading, writing, repeated listening, discussion, teaching and meditation.</p>\n\n<p>Meditation is not insisted upon as the only method. This internalizing is the de-conditioning process. There are many forms of Self-Conditioning.</p>\n\n<p>We never question our conditioning. Here we want to eliminate all our conditioning. Once I discover this fact, all three Sadhyams, their arrival and departure, will not make any serious difference in me.</p>\n\n<p>When things and people are around me, I feel it is a burden; but without them, I also feel emptiness. Moksha means both, burden and emptiness, do not affect me anymore.</p>\n\n<p>There are five conditions for words to reveal any knowledge. Brahman, however, does not fulfill any of them. How can Brahman be revealed by studying scriptures or words or via shabda Pramanam?</p>\n\n<p><br />\n<u>The five conditions for words are:</u></p>\n\n<ol>\n\t<li>Rudhihi or Pratyaksha Vishayatvam: means it is available for direct perception. You can see an object. Then we can name the object. Let us call the object a &ldquo;Clip&rdquo;. In future the word Clip reveals the object in mind.</li>\n\t<li>Jathihi: Means species. Consider a tree outside that you have not experienced. You have experienced some other tree(s). You understand tree without experiencing the tree outside. You are able to do so because this tree also belonged to the same class of tree. You, thus, understand the meaning of the word &ldquo;tree&rdquo; as object falling under a species.</li>\n\t<li>Guna: Properties of the object also help identify it.</li>\n\t<li>Kriya: When someone says, call the driver; the word driver reveals him through his function.</li>\n\t<li>Sambandha: Relationship is another way of revealing. Thus father, brother, sister etc., reveal relationships.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>They say, Knowledge is incomplete without direct experience. Knowing about colors is a form of knowledge, but it is incomplete without me seeing the color by myself. But Vedanta says, no, you lack the knowledge in the first place, it is not the lack of experience.&nbsp;<em> [What is knowledge, then?]</em></p>\n\n<p><u>There are two catgories of experiences:</u></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp; 1. <strong>Dvaita:</strong> Experiencer and experienced are separate. When awake, and during dreams: here, the &quot;I&quot; is limited, located in space, time, etc..</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp; 2. <strong>Advaita:</strong> Experiencer and experienced are separate [Or, there is no Experiencer in the first place]. When in sleep: here, the &quot;I&quot; is unlimited, not bound in space, time.</p>\n\n<p>Muktika Upanishad is like index of Upanishads, it tells about other Upanishads; and suggests that Mandukya Upanishad is the most important among them.&quot;<em>Mandukya ekam eva alam</em>&quot;</p>\n\n<p>Mandukya == &quot;one who is always happy&quot;, a Rishi with this name revealed the Upanishad.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h2>Mandukya Upanishad</h2>\n\n<p>Mantra # 1:</p>\n\n<p>ओमित्येतदक्षरमिद्ँ सर्वं तस्योपव्याख्यानं भूतं भवद्भविष्यदिति सर्वमोङ्कार एव। यच्चान्यत्त्रिकालातीतं तदप्योङ्कार एव&nbsp;।। 1.1.1&nbsp;।।<br />\nOm, the word, is all this. A clear explanation of it is (the following)- all that is past, present and future, verily, is OM. That which is beyond the three periods of time is also indeed, OM.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Mantra # 2:</p>\n\n<p>सर्व्ँह्येतद्ब्रह्मायमात्मा ब्रह्म सोऽयमात्मा चतुष्पात् ।। 1.1.2 ।।<br />\n&quot;All this is verily Brahman. This Atman is Brahman. This Atman has four quarters.&quot;&quot;</p>\n\n<p><br />\nWhat is the four aspected Atma?&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>How can we know of existince of something?</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>It is an object of knowledge by one or more of Pratyaksha, Anumana, Upamana, Arthapatti, Anupalabdhi, Shabda</li>\n\t<li>Even if it is not an object of knowledge now, we are certain that it was in past, or will be in future.</li>\n\t<li>Even if it is not an object of knowledge to me, it is to someone else living.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>An object of knowledge can&rsquo;t be there unless there is a knower.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Mantra # 3:</p>\n\n<p>जागरितस्थानो बहिष्प्रज्ञः सप्ताङ्ग एकोनविंशतिमुखः स्थूलभुग्वैश्वानरः प्रथमः पादः ।। 1.1.3 ।।<br />\nThe first quarter (pada) is &ldquo;Vaisvanara&rdquo; whose sphere is the waking state, who is conscious of the external world of objects, who has seven limbs and nineteen mouths and who enjoys the gross objects of the world.</p>\n\n<p>The knower comes into existence only when &ldquo;I&rdquo; the consciousness wants to know. In wakeful, and dream state as well.</p>\n\n<p>Prameya (known) depends on Pramata (knower). Pramata depends on I (consciousness principle) the atma.</p>\n\n<p>I, satya atma, alone appear as pramata(knower) and prameyam (known) with mithya nama and rupa. I put on a vesham of Pramata and Prameyam. This entire mithya nama rupa&rsquo;s fall in three categories:</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>Mithya nama rupas in jagrat avastha. &nbsp;This is known as Sthula nama rupa or gross names and forms.</li>\n\t<li>Mithya nama rupa in svapna avastha is known as sukshma nama rupa.</li>\n\t<li>All nama rupas are in potential form in sushupti avastha and it is called karana nama rupa.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>When I look at myself from my own standpoint; that I, from my own standpoint am called Turiya atma. It is not an &ldquo;I&rdquo; from sukshma, sthula and karana atma&rsquo;s respective standpoints of view.</p>\n\n<p>In wakeful state:<br />\n&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I becomes Waker, with consciousness turned outwards, through Gyan indriyas. They are the five gyanenindriyas that provide input from the world to me; the five karmendriyas are my output to the world through my activities; the Pancha Pranas (Prana, Apana, Samana, Udana, Vyana the five physiological functions); and four internal organs of Manaha, Budhi, Chitta and Ahamkara. Manaha is the emotional principle; Budhi is intelligence principle; Chitta is memory principle and Ahamkara is ego principle.</p>\n\n<p>Thus in waking state, I am the individual as well as the world. In dream, I create a dream world from my own vasanas. The entire dream world is I myself.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Mantra # 4:</p>\n\n<p>स्वप्नस्थानोऽन्तःप्रज्ञः सप्ताङ्ग एकोनविंशतिमुखः प्रविविक्तभुक्तैजसो द्वितीयः पादः ।। 1.1.4 ।।<br />\nThe second quarter (pada) is Taijasa whose sphere of activity is the dream state, who is conscious of the internal world of objects, who has seven limbs and nineteen mouths and who enjoys subtle objects of the mental world.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>All organs are projected in dreams as well, all of them turned inwards from waker&#39;s point of view.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Mantra # 5:</p>\n\n<p>यत्र सुप्तो न कंचन कामं कामयते न कंचन स्वप्नं पश्यति तत्सुषुप्तम्। सुषुप्तस्थान एकीभूतः प्रज्ञानघन एवानन्दमयो ह्यानन्दभुक्चेतोमुखः प्राज्ञस्तृतीयः पादः ।। 1.1.5 ।।<br />\nThat is the state of deep sleep wherein the sleeper does not desire any objects nor does he see any dream. The third quarter (pada) is the &ldquo;Prajna&rdquo; whose sphere is deep sleep, in whom all (experiences) become unified or undifferentiated, who is verily a homogeneous mass of Consciousness entire, who is full of bliss, who is indeed an enjoyer of bliss and who is the very gateway for projection of consciousness into other two planes of Consciousness-the dream and the waking.</p>\n\n<p>Knowledge goes into its potential form and upon waking it re-appears. []</p>\n\n<p>We love sleep because we love ananda. [But, isn&#39;t it just like non-existence?]</p>\n\n<p>Vedanta does not emphasize nirvikalpika avastha; it emphasizes Nirvikalpika Gyanam. It wishes nirvikalpika state at all times.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>We experience Ananda in deep sleep. How do we know? Because, after waking up mind says, &quot;I slept well&quot;.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Why is there&nbsp;Ananda in deep sleep? Because, there is no distinction.</p>\n\n<p>Through the sleep state alone, we go to the other two states: waking &ndash; sleep &ndash; dream &ndash;sleep &ndash; waking.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Mantra # 6:</p>\n\n<p>एष सर्वेश्वर एष सर्वज्ञ एषोऽन्तर्याम्येष योनिः सर्वस्य प्रभवाप्ययौ हि भूतानाम्।। 1.1.6 ।।<br />\nThis is the Lord of all, this is the knower of all, this is the inner controller, this is the source of all. And this is that from which all things originate and in which they finally dissolve themselves.</p>\n\n<p>This consciousness itself is Ishwar. Omniscient, onipotent, and omnipresent.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Mantra # 7:</p>\n\n<p>नान्तःप्रज्ञं न बहिष्प्रज्ञं नोभयतःप्रज्ञं न प्रज्ञानघनं न प्रज्ञं नाप्रज्ञम्। अदृष्टमव्यवहार्यमग्राह्यमलक्षणमचिन्त्यमव्यपदेश्यमेकात्मप्रत्ययसारं प्रपञ्चोपशमं शान्तं शिवमद्वैतं चतुर्थं मन्यन्ते स आत्मा स विज्ञेयः ।। 1.1.7 ।।</p>\n\n<p>The fourth pada is not associated with any state like the other three. People associate it with states like &quot;Samadhi&quot;, but that is not what Vedanta says.</p>\n\n<p>Then what does Upanishad say? It says Turiya is different from first three padas of Vishwa, Taijasa and Pragya. It is in and through all the three padas.</p>\n\n<p>Bahishpragyam: means the Waker, the jagrat pramatha, the knower in waking state, turned extrovert. Turiyam is not bahishpragyam, not the waker I, not the prathama pada.</p>\n\n<p>Nanta Pragyam means dreamer I turned inwards. Turiyam is not nantapragya, the dreamer I; nor Pragyandhanam, nor sleeper I, nor svapna Pramatha; the knower I in sleep state. Turiyam is none of them.</p>\n\n<p>Na Ubhayataha Pragyam means intermediary experiencer. Intermediary state is one before you go to sleep; you are sleepy but are also awake; not total sleeper nor total waker; or upon waking, in morning you are still sleepy. It is at this time that you get ESP experience, paranormal state of experience. Turiyam is different from these intermediary states as well.</p>\n\n<p>Na Pragyaha, means the all knower or God. Turiyam is not even the Knower of all. The only thing that does not meet all these conditions can only be an inert stone. But Upanishad says it is not an inert principle; It is consciousness without being a Knower.</p>\n\n<p>Thus all Pramatas are negated. With this part 1 is over.</p>\n\n<p>Prameya Trayam: It is not an object of experience. It is Aparameyam. To reveal this Upanishad says it is not an object of any instrument of knowledge. Sarva Pramaha agochara. Pramanam means instrument of knowledge. It is not an eye, or sense organ or adrishtam, pancha indriya agocharam or Pratyaksha Pramana agocharam (not accessible).</p>\n\n<p>If someone says I saw Brahman he has experienced some experience; but Vedanta says that experience is not the ultimate reality. If you saw, if you heard, it is not true.</p>\n\n<p>Agraahyam: It cant be grasped by pancha karmendriyas; touch, smell, see&hellip;.); if it is, it cant be ultimate truth. Any bhagavat darshanam of any bhakta we don&rsquo;t question it but Vedanta says it is not the ultimate.</p>\n\n<p>Alakshanam: Lakshanam means inferring through clue. Smoke without seeing fire. Smoke is Lakshanam. Turiyam is Alakshanam; it can&rsquo;t be known from clues.</p>\n\n<p>In my life, there&#39;s something that is continuous and there&#39;re some things that appear such as thoughts and emotions, and experiences.</p>\n\n<p>Drop all the non-continuous attributes and you are left with pure consciousness which is continuous. [Even after death? It is probably supposed so, by extension]</p>\n\n<p>Consciousness is ever without the universe; free from matter; never associated with the material world. &nbsp;That means there is no universe at all. &nbsp;This word is negating the first three padhas. &nbsp;To understand this, you should remember two laws:</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>&nbsp;Anything that is existent can&rsquo;t be negated. &nbsp;Whatever is sat can&rsquo;t be negated.</li>\n\t<li>&nbsp;What is nonexistent need not be negated</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Whatever is negated can&rsquo;t be sat (existent) or asat (non-existent) category. &nbsp;With this the vedas is negating the world. &nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Therefore, the Upanishads says that the world is different than sat and asat or mithya category. &nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>What is different than existent and nonexistent: &nbsp;That will come under the third category like our dream; dream does not come under existent or non-existent category, but it comes under seemingly existent category. &nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>This unique categoy is called mithya. &nbsp;According to vedas, this universe is unreal, seemingly existent but it is not. &nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Whatever is unreal or seemingly existent, can&rsquo;t be counted even though we experience it. &nbsp;The first three padhas are not real and therefore can&rsquo;t be counted, thuriyum is the only padha countable, thuriyum is ekam &ndash; it is non dual, advaidam, principle.</p>\n\n<p>Consciousness alone exist, matter is unreal and therefore can&rsquo;t be counted.</p>\n\n<p>Where is this consciousness located? &nbsp;Consciousness is not just in the body, but it is everywhere.</p>\n\n<p>A side point here is when a Gyani says I am non-dual advaitam; dvaitam continues for him; he just does not attribute reality to it.</p>\n\n<p>As per Vedanta, perception does not prove reality.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Mantra # 8:</p>\n\n<p>सोऽयमात्माध्यक्षरमोङ्कारोऽधिमात्रं पादा मात्रा मात्राश्च पादा अकार उकारो मकार इति ॥ ८ ॥</p>\n\n<p>The same Atman is again Aum from point of view of the syllables. The AUM with parts is viewed from the standpoint of its sound or letters. The quarters are the letters (morae) and the letters are the quarters. The letters here are A, U and M.</p>\n\n<p>Just like padas, Om has four mantras in it.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>AA (Akara matra) + U (U kara matra) + M (M kara matra) + Amatra (Silence that follows)</p>\n\n<p>Hence, for Turiyam dhyanam Omkara is an ideal symbol.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Mantra # 9:</p>\n\n<p>जागरितस्थानो वैश्वानरोऽकारः प्रथमा मात्राऽऽप्तेरादिमत्त्वाद्वाप्नोति ह वै सर्वान्कामानादिश्च भवति य एवं वेद ॥ ९ ॥</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Mantra # 10:</p>\n\n<p>स्वप्नस्थानस्तैजस उकारो द्वितीया मात्रोत्कर्षादुभयत्वाद्वोत्कर्षति ह वै ज्ञानसंततिं समानश्च भवति नास्याब्रह्मवित्कुले भवति य एवं वेद ।। 1.1.10 ।।</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Mantra # 11:</p>\n\n<p>सुषुप्तस्थानः प्राज्ञो मकारस्तृतीया मात्रा मितेरपीतेर्वा मिनोति ह वा इदं सर्वमपीतिश्च भवति य एवं वेद ॥ ११ ॥</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Mantra # 12:</p>\n\n<p>अमात्रश्चतुर्थोऽव्यवहार्यः प्रपञ्चोपशमः शिवोऽद्वैत एवमोंकार आत्मैव संविशत्यात्मनाऽऽत्मानं य एवं वेद ।। 1.1.12 ।।<br />\n।। इति माण्डूक्योपनिषत्संपूर्णा ।।</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h2>Concepts in Vedanta</h2>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.gitasupersite.iitk.ac.in/sites/default/files/vedanta%202.11.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">Vedantic Concept Map</a></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n","authorId":null,"subject":"philosophy","tags":null,"img":null,"summary":"Vedas, Hindu scriptures, are among the oldest of the texts around the world.
