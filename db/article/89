Remember, the <em>&quot;others&quot;</em> here are people who are not closely related to the person&#39;s self-image. &quot;Loved ones&quot; become part of one&#39;s self-image.</p>\n\n<p>There&#39;s a range of degrees to which a person is interested in dealing with others. &nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>There&#39;s a range of degree to which a person is affected by mood despairs which seems to be part of human existence.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>These basically decide everything in a person&#39;s life: their interests in life, their activities, their rituals, their habits, their mood, their sorrows, their fears, their strengths, their weakness, how they treat others, how they treat themselves, how they handle situations, how they spend their life, their goals&nbsp;etc.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"font-size:28px;\"><strong>How does Personality develop?</strong></span></p>\n\n<p>Let&#39;s start from absolute basics of life.</p>\n\n<p>The basis of animal (living beings) existence is <strong>&quot;self-preservation&quot;.</strong>&nbsp;Animal has an idea of self, and it tries to preserve it, it already has the fundamental structures required to explore possibilities that will help in self-preservation. For the animals which do not have advanced mental faculties, this structure is limited to space exploration. Everything happening in time. Animal is also equipped with memory, which is essential for not only remembering the methods developed for self-preservation, but also the idea of self itself.</p>\n\n<p>Apart from the structure that is responsible for self-preservation, the animal must have some mechanism for identifying other beings which are alike, otherwise it won&#39;t be able to identify its own children. This is extension of self-image structure.</p>\n\n<p>It seems that animals are not only committed to preserve self in space, but in time as well. That&#39;s why animals drive to create children and continue this self.</p>\n\n<p>This is the fundamentals of life: identify self, identify self-like, preserve self in space and time.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Humans are different from other animals only because they have complex structure of all these aspects. They have an inflated self, which includes not only the body, mind, and the pure self, but strata of other forms of thought.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>As part of self-preservation they seek not only security for the self that is basis of life, but the accumulated self as well.</p>\n\n<p><strong>How does this self accumulate in the first place?</strong></p>\n\n<p>Through interaction. Somehow thoughts developed in humans. And as they started exploring the space around them, i.e the earth accessible to them, they developed ideas not only about the places, but about people as well. They formed groups based on the observation of &#39;who helped them in self-preservation and who caused struggles&#39;. They started forming communities. After the development of language, they shared stories to reinforce the adherence of communities.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Due to biological structures, they couldn&#39;t help but form groups with people who were having similar physical structure. But as part of exploration they also came in contact with other groups and interacted with them.</p>\n\n<p>Somehow, after the thoughts and language developed, they couldn&#39;t help but ask these questions:</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Who am I?&quot;, &quot;What am I doing here?&quot;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;These spatial and mental explorations formed the basis of human evolution and cultures.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p><em><strong>These evolved biological and cultural structures are what decide the personality of a person.</strong></em></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>There&#39;s an interplay of biological structures that a person has been endowed with and the culture that he/she has been part of from childhood. The effect of any specific one is undecidable, that&#39;s what leaves a slight possibility of free-will.</p>\n\n<p>A person requires a biological structure responsible for the &quot;ability to capture ideas&quot;, &quot;ability to create ideas&quot;, &quot;promptness&nbsp;to&nbsp;live new experiences&quot;. However, a person also requires cultural encouragement to explore, investigate, pursue new ideas and experiences. As an analogy we can think that to bring about fruits, one needs not only seeds, but soil, water, sunlight and time as well.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>A person definitely has seeds stored in his body as a result of evolution, maybe a correct combination of soil, water, sunlight etc can bring about the fruits desired.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>A person who has never been encouraged to ask questions, will probably never develop openness to new ideas. A person who has been discouraged for asking questions and presenting a new idea, will probably never pursue new ideas. A person who has suffered from exploration of new experiences and is not encouraged, will probably never seek out new experiences.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>People have used different categories to identify personalities for employment purposes:</p>\n\n<ol>\n\t<li>ISTJ&nbsp;Personality<strong>&nbsp; &nbsp;&ndash; The Inspector, Logistician</strong></li>\n\t<li>INFJ&nbsp;Personality<strong>&nbsp; &nbsp;&ndash; The Counselor, Advocate</strong></li>\n\t<li>INTJ Personality&nbsp; &nbsp;<strong>&ndash; The Mastermind, Architect</strong></li>\n\t<li>ENFJ Personality<strong>&nbsp; &ndash;&nbsp;The Giver, Protagonist</strong></li>\n\t<li>ISTP Personality<strong>&nbsp; &nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;The Craftsman</strong></li>\n\t<li>ESFJ Personality&nbsp; <strong>&ndash;</strong>&nbsp;<strong>The Provider, Consul</strong></li>\n\t<li>INFP Personality&nbsp; &nbsp;<strong>&ndash;</strong>&nbsp;<strong>The Idealist, Mediator</strong></li>\n\t<li>ESFP Personality&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>&ndash;</strong>&nbsp;<strong>The Performer</strong></li>\n\t<li>ENFP&nbsp;Personality&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>&ndash;</strong>&nbsp;<strong>The Champion, Campaigner</strong></li>\n\t<li>ESTP&nbsp;Personality&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>&ndash;&nbsp;The Doer</strong></li>\n\t<li>ESTJ&nbsp;Personality&nbsp; <strong>&ndash;&nbsp;The Supervisor, Executive</strong></li>\n\t<li>ENTJ&nbsp;Personality&nbsp; <strong>&ndash;</strong>&nbsp;<strong>The Commander</strong></li>\n\t<li>INTP&nbsp;Personality&nbsp; &nbsp;<strong>&ndash;&nbsp;The Thinker</strong></li>\n\t<li>ISFJ&nbsp;Personality&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>&ndash;</strong>&nbsp;<strong>The Nurturer, Defender</strong></li>\n\t<li>ENTP&nbsp;Personality&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>&ndash;</strong>&nbsp;<strong>The Visionary, Debator</strong></li>\n\t<li>ISFP&nbsp;Personality&nbsp; &nbsp;<strong>&ndash;</strong>&nbsp;<strong>The Composer</strong></li>\n</ol>\n\n<div class=\"math\">\\displaystyle \\begin{darray}{cc} I = \\color{blue}{\\text{Introvert }} &amp; E = \\color{#8c7535}{\\text{Extravert}} \\\\ T = \\color{blue}{\\text{Thinking }} &amp; F = \\color{#8c7535}{\\text{Feeling}} \\\\ J = \\color{blue}{\\text{Judging}} &amp; P = \\color{#8c7535}{\\text{Perceiving or Prospecting}} \\\\ N = \\color{blue}{\\text{iNtuitive}} &amp; S = \\color{#8c7535}{\\text{Sensing or obServant}} \\\\ \\end{darray}</div>\n\n<p><span class=\"math\">\\text{Extrovert} \\implies</span>&nbsp;Someone who gets recharged instead of draining from interactions with others.&nbsp;<span class=\"math\">\\text{Introverts}</span>&nbsp;are opposite.</p>\n\n<p><span class=\"math\">\\text{Observant} \\implies</span>&nbsp;pragmatic, down to earth, strong habits, disciplined.</p>\n\n<p><span class=\"math\">\\text{Intuitive} \\implies</span>&nbsp;Imaginative, open-minded, curious, novelty-seeking.</p>\n\n<p><span class=\"math\">\\text{Thinking} \\implies</span>&nbsp;more logical/rational than emotional. <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sherlock_Holmes\" target=\"_blank\">Sherlock Holmes</a> type.</p>\n\n<p><span class=\"math\">\\text{Feeling} \\implies</span>&nbsp;emotions matter more than logic, rationality. <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dr._Watson\">Watson</a> type.</p>\n\n<p><span class=\"math\">\\text{Judging} \\implies</span>&nbsp;decisive, detail and plan oriented, organized.</p>\n\n<p><span class=\"math\">\\text{Prospecting} \\implies </span>more spontaneous, relaxed than organized.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Apart from these there are pathological Personalities like:</p>\n\n<div style=\"line-height: 2rem;\">\n<ul>\n\t<li><strong>Narcissist</strong></li>\n\t<li><strong>Sadist</strong></li>\n\t<li><strong>Sociopath</strong></li>\n\t<li><strong>Psychopath</strong></li>\n\t<li><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machiavellianism_(psychology)\" target=\"_blank\">Machiavellianism</a></li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"font-size:28px;\"><strong>Is it possible to transform personalities?</strong></span></p>\n\n<p>Yes and No. Remember personality has two structures that support it: Biological and Cultural. The good news is that both of them are malleable. But the bad news is that they malleable only to certain extent. Maybe ultimately everyone can be transformed from one personality to another, even if they are completely&nbsp;opposite to one another, but for some persons it could take more than their lifetime to do so.</p>\n\n<p>Also, sometimes even seemingly insignificant&nbsp;events can initiate the process of transformation. Once the initiation of transformation happens, one can employ different tools and techniques to do the transformation.</p>\n\n<p>The most difficult part is the &quot;initiation&quot;.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>\u25ba Can you transform an animalistic gangster, who doesn&#39;t have thinking capabilities? How would you?</p>\n\n<p>\u25ba Can you transform an ideological gangster, who has thinking capabilities but strictly believes in some ideology? How would you?</p>\n\n<p>\u25ba Can you transform a sadistic/cruel&nbsp;person to a compassionate person? How?</p>\n\n<p>\u25ba Can you transform a stupid person to a thoughtful intelligent person? How?</p>\n\n<p>\u25ba Can you transform an intelligent person to a stupid person? How?</p>\n\n<p>\u25ba Can you transform an aggressive, violent person, a terrorist to a calm, non-violent person?</p>\n\n<p>\u25ba How do you transform&nbsp;obstinate, orthodox&nbsp;peoples&#39; ideas (e.g. about status of women, importance of law&nbsp;etc)? It appears that the most of them do not actually get transformed, they just die away. And their children who have been exposed to contemporary education, lifestyle adopt accordingly.</p>\n\n<p>\u25ba Can you transform a cold, insensitive, selfish person to a caring, compassionate person? How?</p>\n\n<p>\u25ba <strong>Can you transform a psychopath to a normal person?</strong></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; (what about sophisticated psychopaths like this one <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hK3yXnhUbag\">here</a>, intelligent, aware of his actions, master manipulator etc)</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>What is control over mind? Why, how does anyone maintains such thing? How to bring it about?</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>Can meditation, preaching, yoga etc transform a person?</strong></p>\n\n<p>Yes and No. As always it requires proper elements which must already be present. For example, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jiddu_Krishnamurti\" target=\"_blank\">J. Krishnamurti</a>&nbsp;and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U._G._Krishnamurti\" target=\"_blank\">U.G. Krishnamurti</a>&nbsp;they both had received same teachings, meditation practices etc. But their personalities was completely different.</p>\n\n<p>Also, if we propose that meditation, yoga etc in presence of a master will definitely transform a person because of the vibrations/psychological purity of that master, then why don&#39;t relatives of so called &quot;enlightened&quot; people get transformed?&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>Can having the right thoughts, ideas transform a person?</strong></p>\n\n<p>Yes and No.&nbsp;As always it requires proper elements which must already be present. . Aristotle&#39;s personality was completely opposite to Plato&#39;s.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthur_Schopenhauer\" target=\"_blank\">Arthur Schopenhauer</a>&nbsp;even though was highly influenced by Buddhism, was not anywhere near a compassionate personality. It is worth noting that Schopenhauer did appreciate Buddhist philosophy and understood the fundamentals, he probably never practised the techniques offered by that philosophy.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Can psychotherapy transform personalities?</strong></p>\n\n<p>Yes and No. As always it demands the presence of proper seeds, and proper methods by therapist.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>ONE TRANSFORMATION, MENTIONED IN HISTORY BOOKS, IS VERY INTERESTING - ASHOKA&#39;S</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong style=\"font-size: x-large;\">What is the effect of Reason in transformation?</strong></p>\n\n<p>Transformation by reason is smilar to the phenomena of water cutting and shaping a rock. Just like rock, there are mental and physical inertia present in man&#39;s life. This inertia presents a great opposition to the Reason. Hence, the effect of reason is slow and weak in starting. Only when in combination with other factors that transform life, reason can affect&nbsp;strongly.</p>\n\n<p>Once a threshold is reached, Reason can do its job more effectively.</p>\n\n<p>Also, like Socrates said, everybody does &quot;good&quot; as per themselves, they just have false perception of what good is. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvB0MJWfwGw\">Psychopaths</a> have killed people and ate them with the reasoning that this way the person eaten would always be with them.</p>\n\n<p>Reason is limited, because for every reason there&#39;s counter-reasoning, or an alternate reasoning.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n", "authorId": 1, "subject": "psychology", "tags": ["prity=5"], "img": "", "summary": "", "lastUpdated": "2021-03-28 12:01:06.755366"}
