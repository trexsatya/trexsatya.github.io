The following is a summary with extra research and links.</p>\n\n<p>Your Intuitions can be dead wrong sometimes. Hindsight Bias (&quot;I knew it all along&quot;). Sometimes you think you are really right about people, when in fact you are really really wrong.</p>\n\n<p>Why do we assign special significance to events like this: &quot;We toss 5 coins and all come to be Heads&quot;?</p>\n\n<p>Psychology as a Science? These are necessary to consider it a science.</p>\n\n<ol>\n\t<li>Question and a theory (well-formed)</li>\n\t<li>Hypothesis, Testable Prediction</li>\n\t<li>Test With A Replicable Experiment (With Consistent Results When You Change Variables)</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Case Studies work on individual. They are not replicable. They tend to generalize too much sometimes misleading.</p>\n\n<p>Naturalistic Observation - Don&#39;t control the environment, rather just observe the subjects living in their natural environment.</p>\n\n<p>The problem with Psychological Surveys is that the style, the wording used in survey may itself change peoples&#39; answers. It&#39;s more complicated than it seems. It also matters who you are asking (Sampling Bias)&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Correlation (they show the possibility of cause-effect relationship, but they are not enough to prove it)&nbsp;is not Causation.</p>\n\n<p>Another problem is ruling out infinite possibilities that can take part in causation.</p>\n\n<p>Double Blind Procedure - Divide participants into two groups: Experiment group (which will be &quot;messed with&quot;), Control Group (which won&#39;t be &quot;messed with&quot;). Assign members to groups randomly, researchers should not know which participant belongs to which group.</p>\n\n<p>Everything Psychological is also Biological.</p>\n\n<p>Brain does have two hemi-spheres, but the claim that right or left is responsible for specific abilities like creativity is a myth.</p>\n\n<p>Weber&#39;s Law of perception.</p>\n\n<p>Face Blindness.</p>\n\n<p>Homunculus</p>\n\n<h2>Dreams</h2>\n\n<p>Oneirology (study of dreams and sleep)</p>\n\n<p>Why do we sleep? What happens when we don&#39;t sleep? What happens when we sleep?</p>\n\n<p>Why? - Recuperation (rest and repair for neurons), Growth (growth because pituitory glands release growth hormones in sleep; which is why babies sleep all the time), mental functions (arrange information collected during day).</p>\n\n<p>How? - REM (Rapid Eye Movement - a recurring sleep stage during which vivid dreams commonly occur). There are 4 levels of these movements 3 non-REMs and 1 REM which recur during the sleep. During awake hours Adrenal Glands release different hormones like cortisol. With nightfall, Pineal glands release sleepy melatonin hormones, then brain is relaxed but still awake and release Alpha Waves.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>If we not sleep? - Depression, weight gain, immune-system suppression, slowed reaction time.</p>\n\n<p>Insomnia (not able to sleep), Narcolepsy (uncontrollable Sleep attacks) Cataplexy, Night Terrors, Sleep Walking, Sleep Talking</p>\n\n<p>There are two modes of mind working simultaneously: One acknowledging the physical properties of things from various stimuli (unconscious processing), the other busy in forming meaning (out of conscious, unconscious processing).</p>\n\n<p>Why? - Freud&#39;s theory says for Wish-Fulfilment. Information Theory says &#39;to sort out and process day&#39;s events and fix them into memory&#39;. One theory is that dreams are accidental side-effects because REM sleep triggers neural activity.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h2>The Altered States Of Consciousness:</h2>\n\n<p>Hypnosis:</p>\n\n<p>Started with Franz Mesmer (the mesmerizing word comes from his name). His theory is now discredited.</p>\n\n<p>Hypnosis: A calm trance-like state during which you tend to have heightened concentration and focus, and in which you are typically open to suggestion.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Hypnosis can&#39;t actually make you do something against your will (if there&#39;s any). Only 20% of us are thought to be highly hypnotizable.</p>\n\n<p>How? - Adaptive Dissociative Capacity. By utilizing&nbsp;selective attention.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Other options of altered consciousness? - Drugs, alcohol etc.</p>\n\n<p>Neuroadaptation.</p>\n\n<p>Psychoactive Drugs affect your mood and perception. Three categories:-</p>\n\n<ol>\n\t<li>Depressants - disinhibit neural activity. e.g. Alcohol, Tranquilizers, Opiates.&nbsp;Impairs brain&#39;s judgement areas, while reducing your self-awareness and self-control.</li>\n\t<li>Stimulants - excite neural activity. e.g. Caffeine, Nicotine, and Amphetamines (examples of legal ones). Meth, Ecstacy, Cocaine (examples of illegal ones).&nbsp;</li>\n\t<li>Hallucinogents (Psychedelics) - distort perceptions and evoke sensory images e.g. plant, fungal, LSD. Seizures, brain injuries, stress, grief, depression can also distort perceptions and cause hallucination.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Behaviourism (focuses on observable behaviours, not on the undercover things)</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;Associative Learning - when animals link certain events, behaviours, or stimuli together in the process of conditioning.</p>\n\n<p>Classical Conditioning - associative learning.&nbsp;Ivan Pavlov&#39;s experiments. &nbsp;John Broad Watson&#39;s experiment.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Operant Conditioning - reinforcement learning.&nbsp;B.F. Skinner&#39;s experiments.</p>\n\n<p>Examples of reinforcement: Car beeping (a natural passion to stop it) to make you wear a seatbelt. Discounts to make customers keep coming back.</p>\n\n<p>Social Cognitive Learing: Learning by observance, imitation.&nbsp;Albert Badura&#39;s experiment. Mirror Neurons.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Imitation is not just the sincerest form of flattery - it&#39;s the sincerest form of learning. - George Bernard Shaw</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>So it matters who you choose to spend your time with, and how you act.</p>\n\n<p>Memories:</p>\n\n<p>Memory diseases: Chronic Amnesia. Clive Wearning case.</p>\n\n<p>Memory tests: Recall, Recognition (do you recognize given options), Relearning (how quickly you relearn).</p>\n\n<p>Chunking - to make remembrance easy.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Attaching information to life contexts.</p>\n\n<p>Priming or Contex-dependent recall.</p>\n\n<p>Why/How we forget? - We fail to encode it, or We fail to retrieve it, or because of Storage decay.</p>\n\n<p>Memory Interference: Proactive (forward) Interference: your past interferes with present learning. Retroactive Interference: the disruptive effect of new learning on the recall of old information.</p>\n\n<p>Misinformation Effect: Elizabeth Loftus studies. Our memories can be altered by context, wording.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Source Misattribution:</p>\n\n<h2>Cognition</h2>\n\n<p>Prototype: mental image or pinnacle example of a certain thing.</p>\n\n<p>Problem-Solving Strategy: Trial &amp; Error, Algorithms, Heuristics&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Confirmation Bias</p>\n\n<p>Framing</p>\n\n<h2>Language</h2>\n\n<p>Story of Kanzi bonobo.</p>\n\n<p>Word Infant comes from Latin Infans (meaning Not Speaking)</p>\n\n<p>Why does a child acquire language?&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Chomsky&#39;s innate structures and universal grammar.</p>\n\n<h2>Motivation</h2>\n\n<p>Story of Aron Rolston.</p>\n\n<p>What&#39;s the motivation for doing anything? Quadrilateral thinking:</p>\n\n<ol>\n\t<li>Evolutionary perspective. Behaviours as &quot;instincts&quot;. Plenty of behaviours could be just spandrels. Genetic-predisposed instincts.</li>\n\t<li>Drive-Reduction: psychological need compels us to reduce the need to maintain Homeostatis. Incentives play a role.</li>\n\t<li>Optimal Arousal: we strive to maintain a balance between stimulation and relaxation. We avoid both boredom and stress.</li>\n\t<li>Maslow&#39;s hierarchy of needs -&nbsp;</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>At least 3 big motivators for everyone: Sex, Hunger, and Need To Belong.</p>\n\n<h2>Cognitive Development</h2>\n\n<p>The growth of knowledge. Jean Piaget studies.</p>\n\n<p>Assimilation: We interpret new things in terms of existing schemas.</p>\n\n<p>Accommodation: Creating a new schema to accommodate new things.</p>\n\n<p>Four-Stage Theory:</p>\n\n<ol>\n\t<li>Sensory moto stage: begins at birth, uses senses to understand the world. It is quite interesting that in a very short period of time children go from not having object permanence (that objects don&#39;t disappear just because they are hidden) to having object permanence.</li>\n\t<li>Preoperational stage: age ~2 to ~6 yrs. Egocentrism (only able to see from own&#39;s point of view) (a kid will promptly reply if he has a brother&nbsp;but will be confused if asked whether X (his brother) has a brother). They start to understand things in terms of words, Animism (imaginations regarding things). In starting of this phase they struggle with the notion of Conservation (that 5-litre water in this jar is the same as 5-litre water in a different shaped jar). They also struggle initially with Reversibility (that a thing made out of clay can go back to clay and vice versa) because of Centration (child&#39;s tendency to fixate on only one aspect of the problem or the object). In the second half of this stage, the child begins to make a theory of mind, understand feelings, thoughts, perceptions of themselves and of others.</li>\n\t<li>Concrete operational stage: age ~6 to ~12. Children begin to think logically from experience, get rid of Centration.</li>\n\t<li>Formal operational stage: age ~12 to lifetime. Reasoning, Abstract thinking, problem-solving, and hypothetical questions.&nbsp;</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Lev Vygotsky theory.</p>\n\n<p>Attachment Theory.&nbsp; Mary Ainsworth &#39;Strange-Situation experiment&#39;.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Moral Development, Heinz Dilemma 3 stages of moral development:</p>\n\n<ol>\n\t<li>Pre-conventional: moral/immoral based on personal needs.</li>\n\t<li>Conventional: moral/immoral because of Conformity</li>\n\t<li>Post-conventional: moral/immoral based on complex reasoning, abstract reasoning, different aspects etc.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Adolescence issues. Erik Erikson theory. The struggle between the desire to stand-out and the desire to belong.</p>\n\n<h2>Personality</h2>\n\n<p>Freud: Id (~unconscious) working solely on Pleasure Principle, Ego (~conscious), Superego (~preconscious) internalized ideals. Defence mechanisms like Repression, Projection, Rationalization, Displacement. Freud&#39;s theory takes sex at the central stage.</p>\n\n<p>Carl Jung</p>\n\n<p>Psychoanalysis</p>\n\n<p>Carl Rogers</p>\n\n<p>Humanistic theory</p>\n\n<h2>Controversy of Intelligence</h2>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9xTz3QjcloI&amp;list=PL8dPuuaLjXtOPRKzVLY0jJY-uHOH9KVU6&amp;index=24\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9xTz3QjcloI&amp;list=PL8dPuuaLjXtOPRKzVLY0jJY-uHOH9KVU6&amp;index=24</a></p>\n\n<p>Eugenics</p>\n\n<h2>Emotions</h2>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n", "authorId": 1, "subject": "psychology", "tags": [], "img": "", "summary": "", "lastUpdated": "2021-06-27 11:01:49.690883"}
