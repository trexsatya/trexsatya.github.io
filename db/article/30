Does one have the others in mind at the same time? All of them? And while one is saying the one sentence, or before, or afterwards? a No!&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;Someone who did not understand our language, a foreigner, who had fairly often heard someone giving the order &ldquo;Bring me a slab!&rdquo;, might believe that this whole sequence of sounds was one word corresponding perhaps to the word for &ldquo;building stone&rdquo; in his language.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>What goes on in you when you give such an order? Are you conscious of its consisting of four words while you are uttering it? Of course you know this language a which contains those other sentences as well a but is this knowing something that &lsquo;happens&rsquo; while you are uttering the sentence? a And I have conceded that the foreigner, who conceives the sentence differently, will probably also pronounce it differently; but what we call his wrong conception does not have to lie in anything that accompanies the utterance of the command.</p>\n\n<p>How many kinds of sentences are there? Say assertion, question and command? a There are countless kinds; countless different kinds of use of all the things we call &ldquo;signs&rdquo;, &ldquo;words&rdquo;, &ldquo;sentences&rdquo;. And new kinds are being added; new types of languages, new language-games... Olders might become obsolete and be forgotten..</p>\n\n<p>Consider the variety of language-games in the following examples, and in others:<br />\nGiving orders, and acting on them a<br />\nDescribing an object by its appearance, or by its measurements a<br />\nConstructing an object from a description (a drawing) a<br />\nReporting an event a<br />\nSpeculating about the event a |12|<br />\nForming and testing a hypothesis a<br />\nPresenting the results of an experiment in tables and diagrams a<br />\nMaking up a story; and reading one a<br />\nActing in a play a<br />\nSinging rounds a<br />\nGuessing riddles a<br />\nCracking a joke; telling one a<br />\nSolving a problem in applied arithmetic a<br />\nTranslating from one language into another a<br />\nRequesting, thanking, cursing, greeting, praying.</p>\n\n<p>Someone who does not bear in mind the variety of language-games will perhaps be inclined to ask questions like: &ldquo;What is a question?&rdquo; a Is it a way of stating that I do not know such-and-such, or that I wish the other person would tell me . . . ? Or is it a description of my mental state of uncertainty? a And is the cry &ldquo;Help!&rdquo; such a description? Remember how many different kinds of thing are called &ldquo;description&rdquo;: description of a body&rsquo;s position by means of its co-ordinates, description of a facial expression, description of a sensation of touch, of a mood.</p>\n\n<p>Of course, it is possible to substitute for the usual form of a question the form of a statement or description: &ldquo;I want to know whether . . .&rdquo; or &ldquo;I am in doubt whether . . .&rdquo; a but this does not bring the different language-games any closer together. The significance of such possibilities of transformation, for example, of turning all assertoric sentences into sentences beginning with the prefix &ldquo;I think&rdquo; or &ldquo;I believe&rdquo; (and thus, as it were, into descriptions of my inner life) will become clearer in another place. (Solipsism.)</p>\n\n<p>. It is sometimes said: animals do not talk because they lack the mental abilities. And this means: &ldquo;They do not think, and that is why they do not talk.&rdquo; But a they simply do not talk. Or better: they do not use language a if we disregard the most primitive forms of language. a Giving orders, asking questions, telling stories, having a chat, are as much a part of our natural history as walking, eating, drinking, playing.</p>\n\n<p>WHY DO WE ASSOCIATE NAMES WITH OBJECTS?</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;We name things and then we can talk about them: can refer to them in talk.&rdquo; a As if what we did next were given with the mere act of naming. As if there were only one thing called &ldquo;talking about things&rdquo;. Whereas in fact we do the most various things with our sentences. Think just of exclamations, with their completely different functions.</p>\n\n<p>Water!<br />\nAway!<br />\nOw!<br />\nHelp!<br />\nSplendid!<br />\nNo!<br />\nAre you still inclined to call these words &ldquo;names of objects&rdquo;?</p>\n\n<p><br />\nCAN WE TEACH SOMEONE WHAT COLOUR IS? Sure we can point to something and say this is &#39;red&#39;, this is &#39;blue&#39;...</p>\n\n<p>&quot;One has already to know (or be able to do) something before one can ask what something is called. But what does one have to know?&quot;</p>\n\n<p>&quot;We may say: it only makes sense for someone to ask what something is called if he already knows how to make use of the name.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>&quot;And now, I think, we can say: Augustine describes the learning |16| of human language as if the child came into a foreign country and did not understand the language of the country; that is, as if he already had a language, only not this one. Or again, as if the child could already think, only not yet speak. And &ldquo;think&rdquo; would here mean something like &ldquo;talk to himself&rdquo;.&quot;</p>\n\n<p><br />\nBut what if someone objected: &ldquo;It is not true that one must already be master of a language-game in order to understand an ostensive definition: rather, one need only a obviously a know (or guess) what the person giving the explanation is pointing at. That is, whether, for example, at the shape of the object, or its colour, or the number and so on.&rdquo; &mdash;&ndash; And what does &lsquo;pointing at the shape&rsquo;, &lsquo;pointing at the colour&rsquo;, consist in? Point at a piece of paper. a And now point at its shape a now at its colour a now at its number (that sounds odd). a Well, how did you do it? a You&rsquo;ll say that you &lsquo;meant&rsquo; something different each time you pointed. And if I ask how that is done, you&rsquo;ll say you concentrated your attention on the colour, the shape, and so on. But now I ask again: how is that done?</p>\n\n<p>Suppose someone points to a vase and says &ldquo;Look at that marvellous blue a forget about the shape&rdquo;. Or: &ldquo;Look at the marvellous shape a the colour doesn&rsquo;t matter.&rdquo; No doubt you&rsquo;ll do something different in each case, when you do what he asks you. But do you always do the same thing when you direct your attention to the colour? Imagine various different cases! To indicate a few:<br />\n&ldquo;Is this blue the same as the blue over there? Do you see any<br />\ndifference?&rdquo; a<br />\nYou are mixing paints and you say, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s hard to get the blue of this<br />\nsky&rdquo;.<br />\n&ldquo;It&rsquo;s turning fine, you can already see blue sky again.&rdquo;<br />\n&ldquo;Note how different these two blues look.&rdquo;<br />\n&ldquo;Do you see the blue book over there? Bring it here.&rdquo;<br />\n&ldquo;This blue light means . . .&rdquo;<br />\n&ldquo;What&rsquo;s this blue called? a Is it &lsquo;indigo&rsquo;?&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>One attends to the colour sometimes by blocking the contour from view with one&rsquo;s hand, or by not focusing on the contour of the thing, or by staring at the object and trying to remember where one saw that colour before.</p>\n\n<p>But it isn&rsquo;t only these things |17| that make us say that someone is attending to the shape, the colour, etc.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;in certain cases, especially when one points &lsquo;at the shape&rsquo; or &lsquo;at the number&rsquo;, there are characteristic experiences and ways of pointing a &lsquo;characteristic&rsquo; because they recur often (not always) when shape or number are &lsquo;meant&rsquo;. But do you also know of an experience characteristic of pointing at a piece in a game as a piece in a game? |18| All the same, one can say: &ldquo;I mean that this *piece* is called the &lsquo;king&rsquo;, not this particular bit of wood I am pointing at.&rdquo; (Recognizing, wishing, remembering, and so on.)</p>\n\n<p>What is going on when one means the words &ldquo;That is blue&rdquo; at one time as a statement about the object one is pointing at a at another as an explanation of the word &ldquo;blue&rdquo;? Well, in the second case, one really means &ldquo;That is called &lsquo;blue&rsquo; &rdquo;. a Then can one at one time mean the word &ldquo;is&rdquo; as &ldquo;is called&rdquo; and the word &ldquo;blue&rdquo; as &ldquo; &lsquo;blue&rsquo; &rdquo;, and another time mean &ldquo;is&rdquo; really as &ldquo;is&rdquo;?</p>\n\n<p>It can also happen that from what was meant as a piece of information, someone derives an explanation of a word. [Here lurks a superstition of great consequence.]</p>\n\n<p>Can I say &ldquo;bububu&rdquo; and mean &ldquo;If it doesn&rsquo;t rain, I shall go for a walk&rdquo;? a It is only in a language that I can mean something by something. This shows clearly that the grammar of &ldquo;to mean&rdquo; does not resemble that of the expression &ldquo;to imagine&rdquo; and the like. &nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>And we do here what we do in a host of similar cases: because we cannot specify any *one* bodily action which we call pointing at the shape (as opposed to the colour, for example), we say that a mental, spiritual activity corresponds to these words. Where our language suggests a body and there is none: there, we should like to say, is a *spirit*.</p>\n\n<p>Let us first discuss the following point in the argument: that a word has no meaning if nothing corresponds to it. a It is important to note that it is a solecism to use the word &ldquo;meaning&rdquo; to signify the thing that &lsquo;corresponds&rsquo; to a word. That is to confound the meaning of a name with the bearer of the name. When Mr N.N. dies, one says that the bearer of the name dies, not that the meaning dies. And it would be nonsensical to say this, for if the name ceased to have meaning, it would make no sense to say &ldquo;Mr N.N. is dead&rdquo;.</p>\n\n<p>CAN A NAME STILL HAVE MEANING WHEN THE BEARER CEASES TO EXIST? [WHAT ABOUT WHEN IT IS NEVER KNOWN TO EXIST i.e. it&#39;s imaginary]</p>\n\n<p>The demonstrative &ldquo;this&rdquo; can never be without a bearer. It might be said: &ldquo;So long as there is a *this*, the word &lsquo;this&rsquo; has a meaning too, whether *this* is simple or complex.&rdquo; &mdash;&ndash; But that does not make the word into a name. On the contrary: for a name is not used with, but only explained by means of, a pointing gesture.</p>\n\n<p>Does my visual image of this tree, of this chair, consist of parts? And what are its simple constituent parts? Multi-colouredness is one kind of compositeness; another is, for example, that of an open curve composed of straight bits. And a continuous curve may be said to be composed of an ascending and a descending segment. &nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>(Is the colour of a square on a chessboard simple, or does it consist of pure white and pure yellow? And is the white simple, or does it consist of the colours of the rainbow? &nbsp; Is this length of 2 cm simple, or does it consist of two parts, each 1 cm long? But why not of one bit 3 cm long, and one bit 1 cm long measured in the opposite direction? ) &nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>To the philosophical question &ldquo;Is the visual image of this tree |23| composite, and what are its constituent parts?&rdquo; the correct answer is: &ldquo;That depends on what you understand by &lsquo;composite&rsquo;.&rdquo; (And that, of course, is not an answer to, but a rejection of, the question.) &nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>One may say: with the mere naming of a thing, nothing has yet been done. Nor has it a name except in a game. This was what Frege meant too when he said that a word has a meaning only in the context of a sentence.<em> [And an object has a meaning only in the context of environment]</em> &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>When I say &ldquo;My broom is in the corner&rdquo;, is this really a statement<br />\nabout the broomstick and the brush? If the broom<br />\nis there, that surely means that the stick and brush must be there, and<br />\nin a particular relation to one another; and previously this was, as it<br />\nwere, hidden in the sense of the first sentence, and is articulated in the<br />\nanalysed sentence. Suppose that, instead of telling someone &ldquo;Bring me the<br />\nbroom!&rdquo;, you said &ldquo;Bring me the broomstick and the brush which is<br />\nfitted on to it!&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>[What happens in these two secnarios? How does the mind work? What image does the mind see? Is it just about the images that appear before mind? ]</p>\n\n<p>Suppose there&#39;s a language-game in which there is no name for composite objects like broom, only the constituents&#39; names. Is the form of composite consisted in when we use constituent objects in a language-game? Is the forms of constituents implied when we use composite objects in a language-game? Is the meaning/sense common?</p>\n\n<p>Isn&#39;t it that when someone uses the analysed form (one consisting of the constituents), an aspect of matter/reality is lost to him.</p>\n\n<p>Is there something common among all games?</p>\n\n<p>Board-games, card-games, ball-games,...</p>\n\n<p>Are they all <em>entertaining</em>? - Compare chess with noughts and crosses.</p>\n\n<p>Or is there always winning and losing, or<br />\ncompetition between players? Think of patience. In ball-games, there<br />\nis winning and losing; but when a child throws his ball at the wall and<br />\ncatches it again, this feature has disappeared. Look at the parts played<br />\nby skill and luck, and at the difference between skill in chess and skill<br />\nin tennis. Think now of singing and dancing games; here we have the<br />\nelement of entertainment, but how many other characteristic features<br />\nhave disappeared!</p>\n\n<p>And the upshot of these considerations is: we see a complicated net-<br />\nwork of similarities overlapping and criss-crossing: similarities in the<br />\nlarge and in the small.</p>\n\n<p>I can think of no better expression to characterize these similar-<br />\nities than &ldquo;family resemblances&rdquo;; for the various resemblances between<br />\nmembers of a family a build, features, colour of eyes, gait, tempera-<br />\nment, and so on and so forth a overlap and criss-cross in the same<br />\nway. a And I shall say: &lsquo;games&rsquo; form a family.</p>\n\n<p>And likewise the kinds of number, for example, form a family. Why<br />\ndo we call something a &ldquo;number&rdquo;? Well, perhaps because it has a a<br />\ndirect a affinity with several things that have hitherto been called &ldquo;num-<br />\nber&rdquo;; and this can be said to give it an indirect affinity with other things<br />\nthat we also call &ldquo;numbers&rdquo;.</p>\n\n<p>And we extend our concept of number,<br />\nas in spinning a thread we twist fibre on fibre. And the strength of the<br />\nthread resides not in the fact that some one fibre runs through its whole<br />\nlength, but in the overlapping of many fibres.</p>\n\n<p>But if someone wanted to say, &ldquo;So there is something common to all<br />\nthese constructions a namely, the disjunction of all their common<br />\nproperties&rdquo; a I&rsquo;d reply: Now you are only playing with a word. One<br />\nmight as well say, &ldquo;There is a Something that runs through the whole<br />\nthread a namely, the continuous overlapping of these fibres&rdquo;.</p>\n\n<p>How would we explain to someone what a game is? I think that<br />\nwe&rsquo;d describe games to him, and we might add to the description: &ldquo;This<br />\nand similar things are called &lsquo;games&rsquo;.&rdquo; And do we know any more our-<br />\nselves? Is it just that we can&rsquo;t tell others exactly what a game is? a But<br />\nthis is not ignorance. We don&rsquo;t know the boundaries because none have<br />\nbeen drawn. To repeat, we can draw a boundary a for a special pur-<br />\npose. Does it take this to make the concept usable? Not at all! Except<br />\nperhaps for that special purpose. No more than it took the definition:<br />\n1 pace = 75 cm to make the measure of length &lsquo;one pace&rsquo; usable. And<br />\nif you want to say &ldquo;But still, before that it wasn&rsquo;t an exact measure of<br />\nlength&rdquo;, then I reply: all right, so it was an inexact one. a Though you<br />\nstill owe me a definition of exactness.</p>\n\n<p>One can say that the concept of a game is a concept with blurred<br />\nedges. a &ldquo;But is a blurred concept a concept at all?&rdquo; a Is a photograph<br />\nthat is not sharp a picture of a person at all? Is it even always an advan-<br />\ntage to replace a picture that is not sharp by one that is? Isn&rsquo;t one that<br />\nisn&rsquo;t sharp often just what we need?</p>\n\n<p>Frege compares a concept to a region, and says that a region with-<br />\nout clear boundaries can&rsquo;t be called a region at all. This presumably<br />\nmeans that we can&rsquo;t do anything with it. a But is it senseless to say<br />\n&ldquo;Stay roughly here&rdquo;? Imagine that I were standing with someone in a<br />\ncity square and said that. As I say it, I do not bother drawing any bound-<br />\nary, but just make a pointing gesture a as if I were indicating a par-<br />\nticular spot. And this is just how one might explain what a game is.</p>\n\n<p>One gives examples and intends them to be taken in a particular way.<br />\na I do not mean by this expression, however, that he is supposed to<br />\nsee in those examples that common feature which I a for some reason<br />\na was unable to formulate, but that he is now to employ those exam-<br />\nples in a particular way. Here giving examples is not an indirect way<br />\nof explaining a in default of a better one. For any general explanation<br />\nmay be misunderstood too. This, after all, is how we play the game.<br />\n(I mean the language-game with the word &ldquo;game&rdquo;.)</p>\n\n<p><em>[How would you explain to someone what ethics is? Point him to some examples from ethics family...]</em></p>\n\n<p>Suppose I give this explanation: &ldquo;I take &lsquo;Moses&rsquo; to mean the man,<br />\nif there was such a man, who led the Israelites out of Egypt, whatever<br />\nhe was called then and whatever he may or may not have done<br />\nbesides.&rdquo; a But similar doubts to those about the name &ldquo;Moses&rdquo; are<br />\npossible about the words of this explanation (what are you calling<br />\n&ldquo;Egypt&rdquo;, whom the &ldquo;Israelites&rdquo;, and so forth?). These questions would<br />\nnot even come to an end when we got down to words like &ldquo;red&rdquo;, &ldquo;dark&rdquo;,<br />\n&ldquo;sweet&rdquo;. a &ldquo;But then how does an explanation help me to understand,<br />\n|41| if, after all, it is not the final one? In that case the explanation is<br />\nnever completed; so I still don&rsquo;t understand what he means, and never<br />\nshall!&rdquo; a As though an explanation, as it were, hung in the air unless<br />\nsupported by another one. Whereas an explanation may indeed rest on<br />\nanother one that has been given, but none stands in need of another a<br />\nunless we require it to avoid a misunderstanding. One might say: an<br />\nexplanation serves to remove or to prevent a misunderstanding &mdash;&ndash; one,<br />\nthat is, that would arise if not for the explanation, but not every mis-<br />\nunderstanding that I can imagine. It may easily look as if every doubt merely revealed a gap in the<br />\nfoundations; so that secure understanding is possible only if we<br />\nfirst doubt everything that can be doubted, and then remove all these<br />\ndoubts.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n","authorId":null,"subject":"philosophy","tags":null,"img":null,"summary":null,"lastUpdated":null}
