{"name": "When Pieces Of Chess Became Conscious", "id": 253, "content": "<div class=\"reader-article-content\" dir=\"ltr\">\n<p>Once it happened that the pieces of chess became conscious.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>After that, they would not just make their moves, kill, defeat and eliminate other pieces of the opponent, they also started to think about what they are doing.</p>\n\n<p>They became aware of the activities they do. They could plan their moves ahead of the time (or so they thought).</p>\n\n<p>They could think about the pieces on their side and on the other side, they could celebrate their victories, and be sad about defeats, be sad when some piece on their side gets killed.. and so on.</p>\n\n<p>They also started realizing their powers, their duties and responsibilities. They also became aware that they had a <em><strong>life</strong></em> and there is a meaning to their life.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>For example, &#39;A pawns started thinking and believing that the meaning of its life is to march forward, kill an opponent pawn in front and on the diagonal side. When he does so, he feels fulfilment. The pawn is also aware that there is a king that rules along with a fleet of superiors like knight, rook, etc. Similarly for other pieces of the game. The knights and kings etc became aware that they have influence, they can control masses, they can rule...&#39;</p>\n\n<p>The Kings enjoyed being the supreme and all.</p>\n\n<p>Just it happened that someone or something tells some of these conscious pieces that they are in a game. That they are being played. These conscious beings have some intelligence, some rationality and other methods/tools. They use their intellect (obvious or otherwise) and find they indeed are in a game. Now they realize: <em>&#39;yes, we are being played, whatever we thought is our life is a result of not only our choices but an enormous amount of possibilities of moves in the whole game.&#39;&nbsp;</em></p>\n\n<p>But who is playing this game? - Don&#39;t know. Why this game? - Don&#39;t know. What&#39;s the end result of the game? - Don&#39;t know. What&#39;s outside the game(or, is this game all that there is)? - We don&#39;t know. Since when is this game being played? When will it end? - No one knows. Is this game just happening on its own, or is there someone who controls this game directly or indirectly? - No one knows.</p>\n\n<p>Now, these conscious pieces go on and tell other pieces that all of this is a game, they are being played. What will be the response and result of this?</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>Would the pieces still want to play to the game?</li>\n\t<li>Would the pieces still be able to play the game as enthusiastically as they did earlier?</li>\n\t<li>Would the pieces want to find a way out of the game?</li>\n\t<li>Would the pieces want to control the game?</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Ask these questions to the different pieces.</p>\n\n<p>(1) Some pieces which did not understand, or did not come to a belief that this is true:&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>&quot;What bullshit are you talking about!&quot;</em></p>\n\n<p>(2) Some pieces which thought that &#39;<em>yeah, this could be possible</em>&#39;:</p>\n\n<p><em>&quot;Well, what can we do! We don&#39;t know anything outside the game. It&#39;s best to keep on playing the way it is possible&quot;</em></p>\n\n<p>(3) Some privileged pieces like a knight, a rook:&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>&quot;Look! Game or no game, I&#39;ve got quite a lot going on here, and I enjoy that. I don&#39;t f**king care!&quot;</em></p>\n\n<p>(4) Some pieces who completely understood this and started believing this &quot;truth&quot;:</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>&quot;This is not good. I would like a way out of the game. What&#39;s the point of any of this.&quot;</em></p>\n\n<p>(5) Few pieces find out that - this <em>is</em> a game and there is a way out.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>&quot;Look, we do not know the forces there are that are playing this game, but we know how they are playing it, All the players&#39; activities/intentions move through us...there&#39;s a proper mechanism by which, the player controls us, and since we are conscious we can intercept that process. If we start introspecting ourselves and hack ourselves, we will stop reacting to the causes that make us certain moves which make the game possible. If we continue doing this, then if not in this specific run of the game, at least eventually, the player will start realizing that this f**king piece is useless to the game, I don&#39;t know what&#39;s wrong with it. So ultimately he will take this piece out of the game board (Hacking inside)&quot;</em></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>(6) Some pieces have more confidence in their intellectual tools, so they start trying to figure out how to control the game (Hacking outside). Whether there is someone playing the game, or the game is automatically running (don&#39;t know why), they believe they can take over the game.</p>\n\n<p>---- So, what happened to these pieces, after all????</p>\n\n<p>WE DON&#39;T KNOW &amp; MAYBE WILL NEVER KNOW. ALL THE PIECES WENT ON WITH THEIR THOUGHTS, SOME THOUGHT INFLUENCING OTHERS....</p>\n</div>\n", "authorId": 1, "subject": "philosophy", "tags": [], "img": "", "summary": "", "lastUpdated": "2021-09-01 13:07:50.571270"}
