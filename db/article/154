{"name": "Does God Exist?", "id": 154, "content": "<div class=\"box1\">Are you sure that there is no God? Or, are you sure that there is God? Why?<br />\nWhat if you are wrong? There have been famous intelligent people around the world from both sides, those who believe that there is God and those who believe that there isn&#39;t God.<br />\nBy the way, <em>what IS God</em>? Most of the conflicts regarding God is due to difference in their definition and idea of what is God and what isn&#39;t.</div>\n\n<p><br />\nBefore examining this topic, we must have a clear and shared definition of God. All people do not agree on one definition of God. For some people, God is the <em>&nbsp;Supreme Being</em> who created the universe. He has all the powers and can harness every force that exists in the universe (meaning He can defy Gravitational force and fly, he can walk on the water, he can make communication from thousands of miles). He is omniscient (knowing everything including past, present, and future), omnipotent (having all the powers) and omnipresent (being everywhere at the same time), and omnibenevolent (wants good for everyone).&nbsp;<br />\n<strong><em>In general, God is a transcendental entity beyond our comprehension</em>.&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n<p>When you discuss God, you need to be certain about these questions:</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>Is God immortal (Roman Gods are not, they had a genetic hierarchy)?</li>\n\t<li>Is God omnipotent, omniscient, omnipresent, omnibenevolent?</li>\n\t<li>One question which is essential in all debates: If you don&#39;t know about something, <em>does it mean that it does not exist</em>? and If only you know about something or have seen something, but everyone else&nbsp;can&#39;t in the same way that you do, <em>does it mean that it exists</em>? (this question can lead to <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agnosticism\"><strong><em>Agnosticism</em></strong></a>)<br />\n\t&nbsp; &nbsp;(Agnosticism means: <em>We do not have enough grounds to prove or disprove the existence of God</em>)</li>\n\t<li>If you believe in God because you were benefitted in some way from God, then what about lots of people who actually deserve it and don&#39;t get benefit&nbsp;from God? Do you think its good reasoning? - But how do you know better than God, who deserves what?</li>\n\t<li>Is God even <em>definable</em>? If God is supposed to be transcendental, then trying to understad Him, is in vain. But it&#39;s human nature to do that any way.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>If we see worldwide there have been three frameworks in which God&nbsp;is mentioned:</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><strong>Monotheism</strong>: There is one and only one God. (e.g In the Christian religion, Jesus is the only God <em>[ actually there is a trinity of Gods: God the Father, God the Son (Jesus), and God the Holy Spirit. However, effectively Jesus is considered The One. ]</em>)</li>\n\t<li><strong>Dualism</strong>: There exist two forces Good and Evil, both act independently. Kind of perpetual war is going on between them.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Polytheism</strong>: There is a family of God (maybe generations), particular God might be assigned particular power. An example in Roman religions and Indian Hindu religion.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>But more or less all of them acknowledge a Supreme Power which is beyond every worldly scenario you can imagine and is actually omnipotent, omnipresent and omniscient. But its also quite apparent that this Supreme God does not care much about the humans (except for in Monotheism) because from its all-encompassing view human situations don&#39;t matter&nbsp;much (or at least, are not given any priority).&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>So it all boils down to this: we all acknowledge a Supreme power (but that Supreme Power does not have any special concern for humans; This called <a href=\"https://www.allaboutphilosophy.org/deism.htm#\" target=\"_blank\">Deism</a>), so we have our own cut down versions of the Supreme Power, which actually can help humans move through the life (Give victory, give assurance, help here and thereby bending the laws of nature, bending the environment).</p>\n\n<p>Here are some points on which people base their arguments:</p>\n\n<ol>\n\t<li>If there is no God, who/what created the universe? And if God created the universe, who/what created God?&nbsp;</li>\n\t<li>If there is no God, how come miracles happen? Most people take examples from their own life or someone&#39;s relatable.</li>\n\t<li>If there is no God, how come there are so many mythologies claiming that?</li>\n\t<li>If God exists, why is it that there has been so much suffering throughout history? - [Actually suffering always depends on our decisions and actions, but if God is controlling <em>&quot;everything&quot;</em> then He must have&nbsp;his hands in all this, until unless there is a God maybe all-knowing and all-powerful but&nbsp;not &quot;Good&quot;].</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>The religions (beliefs that form a group of people) have used God as a tool to hold people on their path. Religious (and hence Theist) people have their own set&nbsp;of arguments to prove that God exists. Atheists have their own arguments to prove that God does not exist.</p>\n\n<p>So <span style=\"color:#2c3e50;\">&quot;<strong>Does God exists?</strong>&quot;</span> - there is no clear answer to this question. It&#39;s an inevitable (it would become&nbsp;inevitable once you think deeply about all the arguments) journey of seeking. <em>(Is it useless journey? - That&#39;s another debate)</em></p>\n\n<h3><strong><span style=\"color:#8e44ad;\">Arguments that God exists</span>:</strong></h3>\n\n<p>(1)&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watchmaker_analogy\" target=\"_blank\">William Paley&#39;s argument</a>:&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Suppose a stranger is walking into the desert, all of a sudden he sees a watch, he cracks it open, sees that all its parts have been perfectly&nbsp;aligned in order for it to work. What would the stranger think? That, <strong>somebody</strong>, has <strong><em>created</em></strong> this watch with care.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Now imagine the same situation with a squirrel and its eyes. We see that all parts of the squirrel&#39;s eyes have been carefully created in order for it<br />\nto be able to see. Similarly for other living things and other parts.<br />\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Is it not reasonable to draw a conclusive analogy here, that <strong>somebody</strong> <em>created</em> the squirrel?</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<strong>Counter-arguments:</strong></p>\n\n<p style=\"margin-left: 80px;\">This argument ignores the fact that the&nbsp;Theory Of Evolution is quite convincing in explaining how the squirrel got every part in place over time.</p>\n\n<p style=\"margin-left: 80px;\"><span style=\"color:#2980b9;\">- But what if Evolution is God&#39;s way of creating the organisms?</span></p>\n\n<p style=\"margin-left: 80px;\">How come the stranger is stuck upon the idea, that somebody indeed designed the watch, rather than the possibility that parts cobbled together somehow<br />\nand by chance (or evolution), this beautiful watch came into existence?</p>\n\n<p style=\"margin-left: 80px;\">- <span style=\"color:#2980b9;\">Maybe because he has seen watches being made by someone (a person), or something similar to watches being made by some person, and he can correlate. <em>A psychological bias?</em></span></p>\n\n<p style=\"margin-left: 120px;\">&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>(2)&nbsp;<a href=\"https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/fine-tuning/\" target=\"_blank\">Roger Whites argument</a>:</p>\n\n<p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">Suppose that I am inside a building, and the building is covered with detonators, and these detonators can be ticked off by some dials which are outside<br />\nThe dials are moving, there are only a small number of possible combination of dials that would keep the detonators from going off.<br />\nSince I am alive at this moment and have been so for quite some time, is it not reasonable to assume that somebody (some intelligent entity) outside&nbsp;<br />\nhas/is setting the dials in order for me to survive.</p>\n\n<p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">Make this analogy with the cosmological constants instead of dials: we have many cosmological constants which if were anything other than what they&nbsp;<br />\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; presently are, then life as we know it would not have been possible. e.g. it&#39;s scientifically concluded that if the gravitational constant had any value&nbsp;<br />\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; other than what it is now ( ~G = 6.67408 &times; 10<sup>-11</sup>&nbsp;m<sup>3</sup>&nbsp;kg<sup>-1</sup>&nbsp;s<sup>-2</sup>), then there was no chance of matter being accumulated, forming celestial bodies etc.<br />\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Similarly, there are other cosmological constants.</p>\n\n<p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\"><strong>Counter-arguments:</strong></p>\n\n<p style=\"margin-left: 80px;\">- The problem seems to be a possibility (however dubious) that the dials might have been set by chance, and if the cosmological constants would not have<br />\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;been set so, then we would not have existed in the current form, and it would not have mattered.</p>\n\n<p style=\"margin-left: 80px;\">- Modern science claims that there are infinite universes, and in some of the universes these constants happen to be suitable for some kind of life. Maybe the&nbsp;universe also evolved as organisms did.</p>\n\n<p style=\"margin-left: 80px;\">&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>There are many more arguments, most of them play with words/concepts (sometimes mathematical concepts) to prove the existence of God. <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Existence_of_God#Arguments_for_the_existence_of_God\" target=\"_blank\">See Wikipedia</a>.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h3><strong><span style=\"color:#8e44ad;\">Arguments that God Does Not Exist</span>:</strong></h3>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Problem_of_evil\" target=\"_blank\">The Problem Of Evil</a>:</p>\n\n<p><em>Premise-1</em>: Evil things happen<br />\n<em>Premise-2</em>: If there is a God who is omnipotent, omnibenevolent, omniscient then no evil thing would happen.<br />\n<em>Conclusion</em>: There is no God who is omnipotent,&nbsp;omnibenevolent, omniscient.</p>\n\n<p>If we follow the definition of God,&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>God knows everything about You: Your Past, Present, Future<br />\nGod wants Good for you every time: In Your Past, Present, Future<br />\nAnd since God is capable of doing what he wants,<br />\nSo, it turns out that nothing bad could happen to you&nbsp;in past, present, or future for you (or anybody)</p>\n\n<p>We know that this is not true. Terrible things do happen. And hence God does not exist.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Counter-arguments:</strong></p>\n\n<p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\"><strong>Why might an omnibenevolent God have wanted or allowed terrible things to happen?</strong></p>\n\n<p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\"><em>What&#39;s terrible? Terrible now can be good later, terrible here can be good there...</em></p>\n\n<p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\"><u>The Causal Idea</u>: God wanted the terrible things to happen because the terrible things caused the many good things to happen. On balance, the world is better than it would have been had they not happened.<br />\n<u>The Constitutive Idea</u>: God wanted the terrible things to happen because part of what makes good things good is the existence of terrible things.</p>\n\n<p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">Bad things in one timeframe, resulting in better things in the later timeframe.<br />\nBad things to X resulting in better things for lots of Y, Z, and many more. So overall more good done by letting terrible things to X happen. <em>(Is that what is important? More good? Then <a href=\"#\" reactlink=\"/article/178\">Utilitarianism</a> is to be followed, which is another philosophical problem)</em></p>\n\n<p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\"><strong>The analogy to movies</strong>:<br />\nWould you watch a movie which doesn&#39;t contain any bad thing, just the good things happening? Wouldn&#39;t it be dull and boring? God is running this world something like movies, that&#39;s why terrible things happen.</p>\n\n<p style=\"margin-left: 80px;\"><strong>Counter-arguments</strong>:&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p style=\"margin-left: 80px;\">(1) If you can imagine an always-happy-land (utopia), and someone from this place watches this kind of movie (which contains the mixture of good and bad things), he/she will definitely not like this (whether bored or not). So, was God not capable of creating such Utopia?<br />\n(2) It implies that the world is the movie and God is the watcher (probably the only one). God is susceptible to boredom (which seems to be a human limitation) if God is bound by this limitation, he is no more than humans; leave alone the omnipotence, omnibenevolent, and omniscient.<br />\n(3) Watching and enjoying the movie is one thing, and being part of the movie is another.<br />\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;(This is rather a weak argument because mythologies tell us that God sometimes has descended into the world and been part of the movie, <em>however also being at vantage point</em> <em>(That&#39;s another debtate and needs careful analysis of mythological texts</em>))</p>\n\n<p style=\"margin-left: 80px;\">(4) Even in order to spice up a good movie, we do not have to turn it into an evil movie. The world could&nbsp;still have been interesting if the amount and degree of terrible things were reduced.</p>\n\n<p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\"><strong>Karma as an argument</strong>:<br />\nThis is probably a weak argument, that X suffers because God punishes X for its evil doings (<em>maybe in past life: Do we even have past lives? That&#39;s another philosophical problem</em>).<br />\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The question is how come&nbsp;X did the evil thing in the first place.&nbsp;<br />\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;- The answer to this is Free-will</p>\n\n<p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\"><strong>Argument of Free-Will:</strong></p>\n\n<p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">Terror is the result of Freedom or Free-will. Hitler was allowed free-will like all (or at least most), and he acted on free-will but chose evil actions and hence terrible things happened.<br />\nGod wanted humans to have free-will (some mythologies suggest that humans demanded this in the first place when God was creating them)</p>\n\n<p style=\"margin-left: 80px;\"><strong>Counter-argument:</strong></p>\n\n<p style=\"margin-left: 120px;\"><em>Does Free-Will even exist? That&#39;s another philosophical problem.</em></p>\n\n<p style=\"margin-left: 120px;\">(1) God is omniscient, he knew the result of granting this wish, would an omnibenevolent entity grant such wish which will be harmful? Would you grant your child&#39;s wish which you know for sure that it&#39;s gonna hurt him/her in the future?</p>\n\n<p style=\"margin-left: 120px;\">(2) X is given free-will, he chooses to harm Y, and takes action to harm Y, God being omnipotent does not let it happen. X still has free-will, but Y is done no harm.<br />\nBut this does not always happen, which means that either God is not omnipotent, or is not omnibenevolent. <em>(God not only wants to give you free-will, he also wants to give you free-power (maybe cut-down version of it)). (He gives the free-power, but he doesn&#39;t give realization of this power (if it is there) to everyone?)</em></p>\n\n<p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\"><strong>Argument of Punishment</strong>:<br />\nA, B, C, D were created, they were dropped off in the world with free-will, B chose to do the evil thing and tried to kill C. God saved C, but B will be punished for<br />\nhis evil (thoughts), now A chooses to do the evil thing and harm B since B is to be punished, God allows this to happen.<br />\nAt this point in time, we have seen terror happening in the world while God still being proven to be omnipotent and omniscient.</p>\n\n<p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\"><br />\n&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<strong>Counter-arguments:</strong></p>\n\n<p style=\"margin-left: 120px;\">(1) But what about omnibenevolent, does omnibenevolent exclude evil-doers - probably yes.</p>\n\n<p style=\"margin-left: 120px;\">(2) What about children? The children are not part of any Karma cycle, then why God allows situations which makes them suffer? e.g. Hitler acted on free-will and used it for bad, and people who had done bad were punished, but many children also suffered because of him. Why did God allow that?<strong><em> It doesn&#39;t make sense at all, unless you believe in birth-rebirth cycle and Karma which is another debate in itself</em></strong>.</p>\n\n<p style=\"margin-left: 120px;\">(3) As Socrates said: would a musician want the world to be infected with bad music (maybe just because someone has produced bad music, or disregarded good music)? - No.<br />\nThen how come Good God allows the world to be infected with Evil even for the free-will.<br />\nAlso, if I am conscious of the punishment, and I know that there is someone capable of punishing me, how would I ever make a free choice?</p>\n\n<p style=\"margin-left: 120px;\">&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">The problem of Evil clearly suggests that Either God does not exist, or if He exists but he is not all of omnipotent, omniscient, and omnibenevolent. However He could be a combination of two of these three, but not all. <em>(Mythologies support this statement, as there are many stories which suggest that God does not have all of these qualities)</em></p>\n\n<p><strong><span style=\"color:#8e44ad;\"><span style=\"font-family:Lucida Sans Unicode,Lucida Grande,sans-serif;\">God does not exist, because Science can explain&nbsp;the creation of the universe without Him.</span></span></strong></p>\n\n<p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">Science has not been able to explain completely <u>YET</u>, all the explanations involve an unknown starting point (example Big Bang Theory does not explain the initial one singular point&nbsp;which burst, where did that come from).&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.hawking.org.uk/the-origin-of-the-universe.html\" target=\"_blank\">Read this from Stephen Hawking</a>. Stephen Hawking says that time started with Big Bang itself along with space, matter, and energy.

If you enquire&nbsp;deeply about things that you see - Where did we come from? Through evolution from single cell organisms. - Where did single cell organisms come from? - Through organic molecules. - Where did organic molecules come from? - Through inorganic atoms? - Where did atoms come from? - Through particles. - Where did particles come from? ------- Nothing. This is terminal. In the same way, God could be terminal. Maybe God is Nothing, and we know that everything arises from Nothing. If you think that it&#39;s not true that everything arises from Nothing, there always was Something (<em>Just transformations happen in different phases of the universe</em>), then why do you need logic for &#39;how did God come into existence?&#39; Maybe God too has always existed.</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#8e44ad;\"><span style=\"font-family:Lucida Sans Unicode,Lucida Grande,sans-serif;\"><strong>God is The Designer of the universe, he is supposed to be of ultimate supremacy in intelligence and power</strong>.&nbsp;</span>This sophisticated design of the world cannot be the product of random mutation (as suggested by science).</span><span style=\"color:#8e44ad;\"><span style=\"font-family:Lucida Sans Unicode,Lucida Grande,sans-serif;\">&nbsp;</span></span></p>\n\n<p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">Who in his right mind would cause so much suffering for no beneficial reason at all (just for fun maybe!). Why would God engage himself and others in such disruptions?</p>\n\n<p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">Actually whatever is present now can be the result of random mutation, randomness can result in&nbsp;anything be it sophisticated or be it ugly. (But the limitation of science is that it cannot explain how it all started. <em>Or maybe it is not even in the capacity of science or these questions don&#39;t even make sense for science because science works based on observation of something, something that exists in reality and something that is in our minds, but God by definition exists beyond these limitations</em>) .</p>\n\n<p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">Plato says in his book Republic, that God will not punish anyone, God will not take different forms because if God is the highest possible form of good, and if he transforms into anything it will only be worse by definition, and a form of good will not do opposite of its virtue. (This suggests that people suffer because of their own actions only, without any interference from God, but that recursively takes us to the question of free-will).</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"font-family:Lucida Sans Unicode,Lucida Grande,sans-serif;\"><span style=\"color:#8e44ad;\"><strong>Some mythologies suggest that all the universe is kind of movie/theatre directed by God and everyone is given a role to play, and the roles involve all kind of shades.

Is it all just for the sake of keeping everyone engaged in something (God being engaged in directing, others engaged in playing their part)?<br />\nWhat about free will then, why is God not able to control that? If God truly granted Free-Will, then he is no more omnipotent. Or is free will just a false&nbsp;impression?

If a person has somehow formed a conception of God (and on critical analysis, it seems that our reason itself mandates such a concept in humanity - in general), and then a relation is developed b/w this conception, the person (with the rest of his cognition) and the world out there, then it is more than real for that specific person. In simple words, this is about personal experience. If a person has such an experience which leans him towards such a thing as God, then it&#39;s a justified belief. The problem occurs only if this belief starts deluding the person in affairs of his life (and even then, it&#39;s a problem in other people&#39;s perspective, not that person&#39;s perspective).</p>\n\n<p>\n<style type=\"text/css\">hr.style-eight { overflow: visible; /* For IE */ padding: 0; border: none; border-top: medium double #333; color: #333; text-align: center; } hr.style-eight:after { content: \"\u00a7\"; display: inline-block; position: relative; top: -0.9em; font-size: 1.6em; padding: 0 0.25em; background: inherit;\n</style>\n</p>\n\n<p><u><strong>MY TAKE ON THIS TOPIC:</strong></u></p>\n\n<p>(If) Atheism tells me to forget about the concept of God, then I am against it. Do not throw away the concept of God. The concept that there might be&nbsp;someone watching out for you, is helping. Nobody can be positive all the time (not until you are liberated like Buddha). So this kind of thoughts is useful (regardless of whether God actually exists or not). Remember there is no love for those who do not believe (for them it is just some interplay of chemicals psychological system), but for those who believe in love, beauty, they find it; similarly, those who are true believers, they find the God.</p>\n\n<p>If someone claims that &quot;they know there is no God&quot;, or that &quot;they know there is God&quot;, both of them are stupid.</p>\n\n<p>If God is an illusion, this illusion has <em>potential</em> to undermine many realities. This illusion has <em>potential</em> (more than anything else) to give meaning in a meaningless, random universe. Can God really give a meaning to someone? - Remeber, I said potential. Whether the potential can be actualized or not, is a complicated issue, and is itself conditioned on many other things. I admit God is not the only concept that can give &quot;meaning&quot;.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<hr class=\"style-eight\" />\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>If Theism tells me that some answer has been written and that&#39;s the only truth, then I am against theism <em>(Why do we even have thinking capacity, if God doesn&#39;t want me to question and doubt? I know it doesn&#39;t help, the best way to live could be devotion, but why?)</em>. Things once considered absolute truth has been proven wrong again and again (in both religion and science, for example, Earth was once considered flat and be the centre of the universe, as per some religions humans could never leave the celestial body they are living on i.e Earth. Today we have evidence against these arguments).</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<hr class=\"style-eight\" />\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>If Agnosticism tells me that there is something that we still have to find, then I am in. If Agnosticism tells that maybe we cannot know whether God exists or not, then I&#39;m in. After all, God cannot be known through reason. (None of the big questions can be). But if it suggests that there is something yet to be found that will completely assert everything, every doctrine/dogma related to God and religions, then I am against it because, it digresses&nbsp;a lot from our current wisdom and science, and it would be more like delusion.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<hr class=\"style-eight\" />\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Augustine Of Hippo has quoted:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p><big><q>Pray as though everything depended on God. Work as though everything depended on you.</q></big></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This is also supported in&nbsp;Buddhism.</p>\n\n<p>One question worth asking is that &quot;<em>why is it that we have so many intellectuals now claiming that God does not exist?</em>&quot;&nbsp;- One explanation is that&nbsp;God was originally thought to be the cause&nbsp;of everything (at least in popular culture, there might be deep analytical scriptures some discovered, some undiscovered, which present different conception of God), and now with the advancement of science we are seeing a pattern that we can describe things without God, and although we still don&#39;t have ultimate root cause of everything and all the answers, yet we can see a pattern that everything that was considered God&#39;s magic is now being demystified, and following this pattern we hope that we will be able to demystify the magical creation of life and consciousness, that we will be able to create living things just like God. Although I do not believe that it would be possible, if it ever happens, it surely would confirm people&#39;s disbelief. But in my opinion, we should be humble, we are not even close to figuring out how inanimate atoms make living things, not even how atoms themselves are created from nothing, how such a vast universe/multiverse is created or exists, we have infinite mysteries to solve (the concept of infinite itself being one of those mysteries), before we consider ourselves to be equivalent to God.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>One more thing to notice is that when people try to decide logically the existence of God, they forget that God by definition is not limited or fits into any logic. Also, it seems that people either are born with the faith of God or not born with faith God, there are conversions, no doubt, but that could be like discovering their true nature (<em>Really? Then what is true nature?</em> - That&#39;s another philosophical problem).</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h2>&nbsp;</h2>\n", "authorId": 1, "subject": "philosophy", "tags": [], "img": "https://storage.googleapis.com/cupitor-220103.appspot.com/images/atman.jpeg", "summary": "You probably wouldn't change your mind about belief in God, but it's only wise to see that why people are so sure when the fact is that nobody knows the truth about God.", "lastUpdated": "2022-01-01 16:11:13.599627"}
