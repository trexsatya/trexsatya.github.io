My comments are in [] brackets.</em></p>\n\n<hr />\n<p>PHILOSOPHY: love of wisdom, the&nbsp;study of wisdom; and by wisdom I mean:</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>\n\t<p>not only prudence <em>[caution]</em> in the management of affairs <em>[sequence of events]</em>&nbsp;</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p>but a perfect knowledge of all that man can know,</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p>as well as the conduct of one&#39;s life as for the preservation of his health and discovery of all the arts,</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p>that knowledge to subserve these ends must necessarily be deduced from first causes; so that in order to study the acquisition of it (which is properly called philosophizing), we must commence with the investigation of those first causes which are called PRINCIPLES.&nbsp;</p>\n\t</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>These principles must possess two conditions:</p>\n\n<ol>\n\t<li>They must be so clear and evident that the human mind cannot doubt their truth&nbsp;when it attentively considers them.</li>\n\t<li>&nbsp;Other things must be deduced from these, and that the other things cannot be known independent of these.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>God is in truth the only being who is absolutely wise, that is, who possesses a perfect knowledge of all things; but we may say that men are more or less wise as their knowledge of the most important truths is greater or less.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>The utility of philosophy:</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>Since it embraces all that the human mind can know, it is what separates us from savages and barbarians. Civilisation and culture is regulated by the degree in which true philosophy nourishes in it.</li>\n\t<li>Just like a man should make use of his OWN eyes to direct his steps, and enjoy beauties of colour and light using his own eyes, than that he should blindly follow the guidance of another; though the latter is certainly better than to have the eyes closed with no&nbsp;guide except one&#39;s self. But to live without philosophizing is in truth the same as keeping the eyes closed without attempting to open them; and the pleasure of seeing discloses is not to be compared with the satisfaction afforded by the discoveries of philosophy.&nbsp;</li>\n\t<li>It is requisite for the regulation of our manners, and for conducting us through life, than is the use of our eyes for directing our steps.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>There is no mind, how ignoble soever it be, which remains so firmly bound up in the objects of the senses, as not sometime&nbsp;or other to turn itself away from them in the aspiration after some higher good, although not knowing frequently wherein that good consists.</p>\n\n<p>Including all the sciences we now possess, what are the degrees of wisdom at which we have arrived?</p>\n\n<ol>\n\t<li>Notions so clear of themselves that they can be acquired without meditation</li>\n\t<li>All that the experience of the senses dictates</li>\n\t<li>That which the conversation of other men teaches us</li>\n\t<li>The reading, not of all books, but especially of such as have been written by persons capable of conveying proper instruction.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Divine revelation is not among these, because it does not conduct us by degrees, but elevates us at once to an infallible faith.</p>\n\n<p>There have been, indeed, in all ages great minds who endeavoured to find a fifth road to wisdom, incomparably more sure and elevated than the other four. The path they essayed was the search of first causes and true principles, from which might be deducted the reasons of all that can be known by man; and it is to them the appellation of philosophers has been more especially accorded. I am not aware that there is any one of them up to the present who has succeeded in this enterprise.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Plato and Aristotle differed in that, Plato, in the footsteps of his master, Socrates, ingenuously confessed that he had never yet been able to find anything certain, and he was contented to write what seemed to him probable, imagining, for this end, certain principles by which he endeavoured to account for the other things. Aristotle, on the other hand, characterised by less candour, although for twenty years the disciple of Plato, and with no priinciples beyond those of his master, completely reversed his mode of putting them, and proposed as true and certain what it is probable as true and certain what it is probable he himself never esteemed as such.</p>\n\n<p>And though I hold all the philosophers in esteem, and am unwilling to incur odium [general disgust incurred by someone as a result of their actions] by my censure, I can adduce [cite as evidence] a proof of my assertion, which I do not think any of them will gainsay [contradict], which is, that they all laid down a principle what they did not perfectly know. E.g, I know none of them who did not suppose that there was gravity in terrestrial bodies; but although experience shows us very clearly that bodies we call heavy descend towards the centre of the earth, we do not, therefore, know the nature of gravity, that is, the cause or principle in virtue of which bodies descend, and we must derive our knowledge of it from some other source.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>By considering that he who <em>strives to doubt of all</em> is <em>unable nevertheless to doubt that he is</em> while he doubts, and that what reasons thus, in not being able to doubt of itself and doubting nevertheless of everything else, is not that which we call our body, but what we name our mind or thought, I have taken the existence of this thought for the first principle, from which I very clearly deduced the following truths, namely that there is a God who is the author of all that is in the world, and who, being the source of all truth, cannot have created our understanding of such a nature as to be deceived in the judgements it forms of the things of which it possesses a very clear and distinct perception. The second circumstance that proves the clearness of these principles is, that they have been known in all ages, and even received as true and indubitable by all men, with the exception only of the existence of God, which has been doubted by some, because they attributed too much to the perceptions of the senses, and God can neither be seen nor touched.</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#8e44ad;\"><em>[NOTE: THE PRINCIPLES (about GOD) LAID BY DESCARTES FALL DOWN IF WE CONSIDER THE DOUBTS RAISED BY FREUDS THEORY - THAT GOD COULD BE CONSTRUCTED IN MIND OUT OF OUR INFANTILE UNCONSCIOUS THAT WE NEED A FATHER WHO IS ALL-POWERFUL] (<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sigmund_Freud%27s_views_on_religion\" target=\"_blank\">Freud&#39;s Views On Religion</a>)</em></span></p>\n\n<h3>OF THE PRINCIPLES OF HUMAN KNOWLEDGE</h3>\n\n<ol>\n\t<li><span style=\"color:#2980b9;\">That in order to seek the&nbsp;truth, it is necessary once in the course of our life, to doubt, as far as possible, of all things.</span><br />\n\t&nbsp;Because we have been prejudiced, we can&#39;t get rid of those unless we doubt all things in which&nbsp;we discover even the smallest suspicion of uncertainty.</li>\n\t<li><span style=\"color:#2980b9;\">That we ought also to consider as false all that is doubtful.</span></li>\n\t<li><span style=\"color:#2980b9;\">That we ought not meanwhile to make use of doubt in the conduct of life.&nbsp;</span><br />\n\tOtherwise, we won&#39;t be able to act, before we could free ourselves from our doubts.</li>\n\t<li><span style=\"color:#2980b9;\">Why we may doubt of sensible things.&nbsp;</span><br />\n\tWe will doubt, first, whether of all the things that have ever fallen under our senses, or which we have ever imagined, any one really exist; in the first place, because we know by experience that the senses sometimes err, and it would be imprudent to trust too much to what has even once deceived us;&nbsp;<br />\n\tsecondly, because in dreams we perpetually seem to perceive or imagine innumerable objects which have no existence. And to one who has thus resolved upon a general doubt, there appear no marks by which he can with certainty distinguish sleep from the waking state.</li>\n\t<li><span style=\"color:#2980b9;\">Why we may also doubt of mathematical demonstrations.</span><br />\n\tWe will also doubt of the other things we have before held as most certain, and of their principles which we have hitherto deemed self-evident; in the first place, because we have sometimes seen men fall into error in such matters, and admit as absolutely certain and self evident what to us appeared false, but chiefly because we have learnt that God who created us in all-powerful; for we do not yet know whether perhaps it was his will to create us so that we are always deceived, even in the things we think we know best: since this does not appear more impossible than our being occasionally deceived, which, however, as observation teaches us, is the case. And if we suppose that an all-powerful God is not the author of our being, and that we exist of ourselves or by some other means, still, the less powerful we suppose our author to be, the greater reason will we have for beliieving that we are not so perfect as that we may not be continually deceived.</li>\n\t<li><span style=\"color:#2980b9;\">That we possess a free-will, by which we can withhold our assent from what is doubtful, and thus avoid error.&nbsp;</span><br />\n\tNo matter who our creator is, we conscious of a freedom...</li>\n\t<li><span style=\"color:#2980b9;\">That we cannot doubt of our existence while we doubt, and that this is the first knowledge we acquire when we philosophize in order.</span><br />\n\tFor there is a repugnance [=intense disgust] in conceiving that what thinks does not exist. Accordingly, the knowledge, I THINK, THEREFORE I AM, is the first and most certain that occurs to the one who philosophizes orderly.</li>\n\t<li><span style=\"color:#2980b9;\">Thus we hence discover the distinction between the mind and the body, or between a thinking and corporeal thing.&nbsp;</span><br />\n\tAnd this is the best mode of discovering the nature of the mind, and its distinctness from the body: for examining what we are, while supposing that there is nothing really existing apart from our thought, we clearly perceive that neither extension, nor figure, nor local motion, nor anything similar that can be attributed to body, pertains to our nature, and nothing save thought alone; and, consequently, that the notion we have of our mind precedes that of any corporeal thing, and is more certain, seeing we still doubt whether there is any body in existence, while we already perceive that we think.</li>\n\t<li><span style=\"color:#2980b9;\">What thought (COGITATIO) is.</span><br />\n\tBy the word thought, I understand all that which so takes place in us that we of ourselves are immediately conscious of it; and, accordingly, not only to understand (INTELLIGERE, ENTENDRE), to will (VELLE), to imagine (IMAGINARI), but even to perceive(SENTIRE, SENTIR), are here the same as to think (COGITARE, PENSER). For if I say, I see, or I walk, therefore I am; and if I understand by vision or walking the act of my eyes or of my limbs, which is the work of the body, the conclusion is not absolutely certain, because as is often the case in dreams, I may think that I see or walk, although I do not open my eyes or move from my place, and even, perhaps, although I have no body: but, if I mean the sensation itself, or consciousness of seeing or walking, the knowledge is manifestly certain, because it is then referred to the mind, which alone perceives or is conscious that it sees or walks.</li>\n\t<li><span style=\"color:#2980b9;\">That the notions which are simplest and self-evident, are obscured by logical definitions; and that such </span><span style=\"color:#2980b9;\">are</span><span style=\"color:#2980b9;\"> not to be reckoned among the cognitions acquired by study, [but they are born with us].</span><br />\n\tWhen I said&nbsp; &quot;I think, therefore I am&quot;, I did not therefore deny that it was necessary to know what thought, existence, and certitude are, and that in order to think it is necessary to be; but these are the most simple notions, and are kind of self-evident.</li>\n\t<li><span style=\"color:#2980b9;\">How we can know our mind more clearly than our body.</span><br />\n\tFor example, if I judge that there is an earth because I touch or see it, on the same ground, and with still greater reason, I must be persuaded that my mind exists; for it may be, perhaps, that I think I touch the earth while there is one in existence; but it is not possible that I should so judge, and my mind which judges does not exist.</li>\n\t<li><span style=\"color:#2980b9;\">How it happens that everyone does not come equally to know this.&nbsp;</span><br />\n\tThey did not distinguish with sufficient care the mind from the body. They never doubted their own existence and by THEMSELVES they meant their bodies, and to which they erroneously attributed the faculty of perception.</li>\n\t<li><span style=\"color:#2980b9;\">In what sense the knowledge of other things depends upon the knowledge of God.</span><br />\n\tOur mind discovers in itself the ideas of many things like numbers and figures and principles THAT IF EQUALS BE ADDED TO EQUALS THE WHOLE WILL BE EQUAL and the like; from which it is easy to demonstrate that the three angles of a triangle are equal to two right angles, etc. Now so long as we attend to the premises from which this conclusion and others similar to it were deduced, we feel assured of their truth; but, as the mind cannot always think of these with attention, when it has the remembrance of a conclusion without recollecting the order of its deduction, and is uncertain whether the author of its being has created it of a nature that is liable to be deceived, even in what appears to be most evident, it perceives that there is just ground to distrust the truth of such conclusions, and that it cannot possess any certain knowledge until&nbsp;it has discovered its author.</li>\n\t<li><span style=\"color:#2980b9;\">That we may validly infer the existence of God from necessary existence being comprised in the concept we have of him.&nbsp;</span><br />\n\t..,for example, the equality of its three angles to two right angles is necessarily comprised in the idea of a triangle, the mind is firmly persuaded that the three angles of a triangle are equal to two right angles; so, from its perceiving necessary and eternal existence to be comprised in the idea which it has of an all-perfect Being, it ought manifestly to conclude that this all-perfect Being exists.</li>\n\t<li><span style=\"color:#2980b9;\">That necessary existence is not in the same way comprised in the notions which we have of other things, but merely contingent existence.&nbsp;</span><br />\n\t...that the idea of an all-perfect Being has not been framed by itself, and that it does not represent a chimera, but a true and immutable nature, which must exist since it can only be conceived as necessarily existing.</li>\n\t<li><span style=\"color:#2980b9;\">That prejudices hinder many from clearly knowing the necessity of the existence of God.</span><br />\n\t...but as we have been accustomed to distinguish, in all other things, essence from existence,...that a doubt arises as to whether the idea we have of him is not one of those which we frame at pleasure, or at least of that class to whose essence existence does not pertain.</li>\n\t<li><span style=\"color:#2980b9;\">That the greater objective (representative) perfection there is in our idea of a thing, the greater also must be the perfection of its cause.</span><br />\n\t...a person who has the idea of a machine, in the construction of which great skill is displayed, in which circumstances we have a right to inquire how he came by this idea, whether, for example, he somewhere saw such a machine constructed by another, or whether he was so accurately taught the mechanical sciences, or is endowed with such force of genius, that he was able of himself to invent it, without having elsewhere seen anything like it; for all the ingenuity which is contained in the idea objectively only, or as it were in a picture, must exist at least in its first and chief cause, whatever that may be, not only objectively or representatively, but in truth formally or eminently.</li>\n\t<li><span style=\"color:#2980b9;\">That the existence of God may be again inferred from the above.&nbsp;</span><br />\n\t..For it is not only manifest by the natural light that nothing cannot be the cause of anything whatever, and that the more perfect cannot arise from the less perfect, so as to be thereby produced as by its efficient and total cause, but also that it is impossible we can have the idea or representation of anything, unless there be somewhere, either in us or out of us, an original which comprises, in reality, all the perfections that are thus represented to us; but we do not in any way find in ourselves those absolute perfections of which we have the idea, we must conclude that they exist in some nature different from ours, that is, in God.</li>\n\t<li><span style=\"color:#2980b9;\">That, although we may not comprehend the nature of God, there is yet nothing which we know so clearly as his perfections.</span><br />\n\t..to those who have been accustomed to contemplate the idea of God, and turn their thoughts to his infinite perfections;...</li>\n\t<li><span style=\"color:#2980b9;\">That we are not the cause of ourselves, but that this is God, and consequently that there is a God.</span><br />\n\t..we cannot even recollect when the idea we have of a God was communicated to us by him, seeing it was always in our minds,...<br />\n\t..for it is in the highest degree evident by the natural light, that that which knows something more perfect than itself, is not the source of its own being, since it would thus have given to itself all the perfections which it knows; and that, consequently, it could draw its origin from no other being than from him who possesses in himself all those perfections, i.e., from God.</li>\n\t<li><span style=\"color:#2980b9;\">That the duration alone of our life is sufficient to demonstrate the existence of God.</span><br />\n\t..from the fact we now are, it does not necessarily follow that we shall be a moment afterwards, unless some cause, viz. that which first produced us, shall, as it were, continually reproduce us, that is, conserve us. For we easily understand that there is no power in us by which we can conserve ourselves, and that the being who has so much power as to conserve us out of himself, must also by so much greater reason conserve himself, or rather stand in need of being conserved by no one whatever, and, in fine, be God.</li>\n\t<li><span style=\"color:#2980b9;\">That </span><span style=\"color:#2980b9;\">in</span><span style=\"color:#2980b9;\"> knowing the existence of God, in the manner here explained, we likewise know all his attributes, as far as they can be known by the natural light alone.</span><br />\n\t...he is eternal, omnipotent, the source of all goodness and truth, creator of all things, and that, in fine, he has in himself all that in which we can clearly discover any infinite perfection or good that is not limited by any imperfection.</li>\n\t<li><span style=\"color:#2980b9;\">That God is not corporeal, and does not perceive by means of senses as we do, or will the evil of sin.</span><br />\n\t..looking to corporeal nature, since divisibility is included in local extension, and this indicates imperfection, it is certain that God is not body. And although in men it is to some degree a perfection to be capable of perceiving by means of the senses, nevertheless since in every sense there is passivity which indicates dependency, we must conclude that God is in no manner possessed of sense, and that he only understands and wills, not, however, like us, by the acts in any way distinct, but always by an act that is one, identical, and the simplest possible, understands, wills&nbsp;and operates all, that is, all things that in reality exist; for he does not will the evil of sin, seeing this is but the negation of being.</li>\n\t<li>That we may validly infer the existence of God from necessary existence of God from necessary existence being comprised in the concept we have of him.<br />\n\t...And just as for example, the equality of its three angles to two right angles is necessarily comprised in the idea of a triangle, the mind is firmly persuaded that the three angles of a triangle are equal to two right angles; so, from its perceiving necessary and eternal existence to be comprised in the idea which it has of an all-perfect Being, it ought manifestly to conclude that this all-perfect Being exists.</li>\n\t<li>That necessary existence is not in the same way comprised in the notions which we have of other things, but merely contingent existence.<br />\n\t..mind has no idea of any other thing in which it can discover that necessary existence is contained; for, from this circumstance alone, it will discern that the idea of an all-perfect Being has not been framed by itself...</li>\n\t<li>That prejudices hinder many from clearly knowing the necessity of the existence of God.<br />\n\t...when we do&nbsp;not steadily fix our thoughts on the contemplation of the all-perfect Being, that a doubt arises...</li>\n\t<li>That the greater objective (representative) perfection there is in our idea of a thing, the greater also must be the perfection of its cause.<br />\n\t....</li>\n\t<li>That the existence of God may again be inferred from above.<br />\n\t<em>[Where did we get the idea of God from?]</em>&nbsp;Nothing cannot be cause of any thing , and more perfect cannot result from the less perfect, .. we cannot have the idea of anything whatever unless there be somewhere... <em>[Really?
