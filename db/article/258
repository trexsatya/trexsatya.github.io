Shares how he hates his father, and will give party to everyone when the father dies.</p>\n\n<p>When I said, &quot;you are only going to do harm to yourself by hating&quot;... he says he knows it, but what can he do. Shares how his father said, &quot;why didn&#39;t you die&quot; when he was on the verge of death due to some illness. [seems that he knows the wisdom quotes, but they have no effect as he is troubled by the agony of the past, habits of his parents].
