So, let&#39;s just map out those views on education.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<ol>\n\t<li>Education as <em>Training of Skills</em>&nbsp;</li>\n\t<li>Education as <em>Training for Life</em></li>\n\t<li>Education as <em>Development of Learning Ability</em></li>\n\t<li>Education as <em>Life-long Journey</em></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p><strong>When we say &quot;training of skills&quot;, which skills are we talking about?</strong></p>\n\n<p>Depends on the time and place. Whatever skills are in demand.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>Demand for what? To what end?</strong></p>\n\n<p>Wherever the society is heading, whatever the society is trying to achieve at the time and place.</p>\n\n<p>For example, if we see the current state, our society is moving towards a technocratic setup, where life is so bound to technology that it&#39;s hard to imagine one without it. So, naturally technical skills are in high demand. There are other skills that are required as well. Some of them are in demand due to the effects of technological progress itself. For example, skills based on &quot;Emotional Intelligence&quot;, what the heck does this even mean. Something that&#39;s part of everyone&#39;s emotions is molded into a skill. Similarly, the high demand for entertainment products also <em>seems to be</em> due to this progress.</p>\n\n<p>In today&#39;s world, there&#39;s a huge list of skills that are required.</p>\n\n<p><strong>But&nbsp;when we say <em>required&nbsp;</em><em>skills</em>, aren&#39;t we also including &lsquo;life&nbsp;skills&rsquo;&nbsp;as well?</strong></p>\n\n<p>Implicitly, yes. Remember though, we are not just talking about <em>education</em>, we are talking about the&nbsp;<em>education system</em>. And systems bring in a lot of complexity to the implementation of any concept. It is quite obvious that systems are not affected equally by all parts. In other words, some parts of any system are more important than the others i.e. they start controlling the system at some point. Take any system in nature and see that there&#39;s always some part that dominates the functioning of the whole system e.g. in the case of our body, the head/brain dominates it. Now take the same concept and see our man-made systems, you will realize that in every system some parts dominate the whole.</p>\n\n<p>So, what skills are actually included depends on which&nbsp;part of the society is controlling the education system. Notice that this control need not be conscious i.e. it may not&nbsp;be that people are deliberately thinking about how to control the system so that we get the most benefit, although that could be the case in some instances. Societies are always polarized in terms of power. And, although power has different structures, the core attribute of power is that it can control the masses (we are talking in the context of society). You can see in history how the structures of power have played their role in shaping everything including education. A society dominated by warriors will focus primarily on physical education. A society dominated by religious leaders will focus on religious education.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>[<em>Who dominates our society nowadays?</em>]</p>\n\n<p>So, the powerful part controls the education system as well.</p>\n\n<p>It could be the religious group, the warrior group, or something else that controls the education system.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>Can powerful parts control the education system in democracies?</strong></p>\n\n<p>Remember that true democracy is a rare thing. It&#39;s more like control-by-mob. And mob surely can be controlled, it often is controlled, otherwise, it dissipates soon after causing damage.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Okay, some part of society controls the education system. What&#39;s the point though?</strong></p>\n\n<p>The point is that the &quot;education&quot;-system controlled by the parts cannot provide real education. It&#39;s not even rational to hope so., because the part that controls the education system is actually the most active part in taking the society in whatever direction it is going. The system will not even survive significantly without their control.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>So, the real education has to come from outside the system, or a larger system. Real education has to come from all the parts of the society that a person is in contact with: parents, friends, neighbors, relatives, teachers, even strangers.</p>\n\n<p>In simple words, real education cannot be bound to some clearly organized system.</p>\n\n<p><strong>But, that means there&#39;s no hope. It&#39;s all or nothing.</strong></p>\n\n<p>No, what it means is that the change has to come in form of a multi-dimensional feedback network. If real education comes from all these sectors, there must already be educated people in all these sectors i.e. parents, friends, relatives etc all must be educated. But how are they going to be educated? By feedback network, education acquired by one small part of these sectors must spread through other parts, and the effect/feedback will reinforce that part and so on.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>What is a person to be educated about?</strong></p>\n\n<p>Of course, education systems will focus on the skills that are required by society.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>There could be other skills that might be required by society because of the many factors e.g. nowadays requirement comedic skill seems to be all-time high (Is it because people tend to be depressed easily now as a result of the way the world has been going on for some time?). Similarly for other entertainment skills.</p>\n\n<p>There are some elements of education that may not even be about requirements e.g. real Science (based purely on curiosity rather than technological demands), Philosophy (It&#39;s just because we happen to think, and some people think more).&nbsp;It&#39;s not even about the requirement, although you can make a case as to why it (both Science and Philosophy) is indeed required.</p>\n\n<p>There are some elements of education which are about life - We don&#39;t know where did we come from? We don&#39;t know where are we going. But now that we are here, we have to make something out of it. How to make the best out of it. Education should be about how to conduct one&#39;s life such that it does not feel wasted.</p>\n\n<p>There are some elements of education which are about other lives - How to interact with others, how to make the best of the existence together with other people, and even other living things. That should be a goal of education.</p>\n\n<p>There are some elements of education that are about discovery - We don&#39;t even know what a person is potentially capable of (and I don&#39;t believe that knowing that would be any better). So one of the best things that can happen for a person is to realize some potential, discover it and make it real, not for others to show off, but for oneself to relish the realization. We don&#39;t know what a person is psychologically capable of, the goal of education should be to help the person explore one&#39;s psyche and develop it in a fulfilling way.</p>\n\n<p>There&#39;re some fundamental elements of education that can be applied everywhere, in every sector - Creativity, imagination, and critical thinking. You might say that Imagination cannot be taught. But remember <em>education</em>&nbsp;is not about teaching, it&#39;s about helping the person develop all these elements by discovery. Help them discover the flaws, the strengths, the way etc.</p>\n\n<p>Teaching is about using these elements to transfer skills.</p>\n\n<p>Also, there are overwhelmingly so many things in this world, so what should one be taught?</p>\n\n<p>I think that the simplest and best way is to let the experience guide you. Let them/make them observe, experience the phenomena, then teach them about theories, ideas, opinions, models, etc. If a person is not fascinated by a particular domain, a particular category of experience, observation, there&#39;s no point in teaching them about intricate details of that subject. It not only wastes their time, the teacher&#39;s time, it also wastes precious experiences that they could have got otherwise.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>Regarding tests</strong></p>\n\n<p>It is a common notion that competition is the best way to move forward. This notion probably draws support from Capitalistic arrangements, but fails to notice the drawbacks.</p>\n\n<p>Tests are not required to develop people. The competition gives them only extrinsic motivation, what they need is intrinsic motivation. And, as a result, even if they get less than what they could have got otherwise, at least they would lead a satisfied life.</p>\n\n<p>The only sort of test that can be really helpful, even in long term, is when the teacher assesses the natural inclinations of the student. But, this assessment needs to be subtle. For example, the teacher can create a situation where the student is motivated/needed to solve a problem, the teacher knows the tools that can help solve the situation, and he removes them from the place, but puts raw material or other non-obvious tools which can help solve. If the student manages or tries to use those lesser tools to create the tool, or to solve the situation in a different way, it means that the student has a natural&nbsp;inclination towards engineering.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<hr />\n<p>Contributors and Ideas/Concepts around Learning/Education:-</p>\n\n<p><strong>Plato -</strong>&nbsp;Innate knowledge. People rather discover the knowledge they already have by external exposure. This idea was in combination with other ideas like Soul, Immortality of Soul, Rebirth of Soul.

If he/she is thoughtful enough and is willing to invest time, then play some game, role with them so that they enter an imaginary situation where they realize that knowledge is necessary. If not, then try to put them in such a harmless situation that they themselves see this.</p>\n\n<p>2. Learner must be made to realize that it is worth investing in the writings of others. The following are the excerpts from J. Vives&#39; book.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>&ldquo;Imagine that over the river yonder there was a narrow plank as bridge, and that every one told you that as many as rode on horseback and attempted thus to cross it had fallen into the water, and were in danger of their lives, and, moreover, with difficulty they had been dragged out half dead.... Would not, in such a case, a man seem to you to be demented, who, taking that journey, did not get off from his horse and escape from the danger in which the others had fallen?&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p><i>Philip.</i>&nbsp;To be sure he would.</p>\n\n<p><i>Sophobulus.</i>&nbsp;And rightly. Seek now from old men, as to what chiefly they have felt unfortunate in this life, what negligence in themselves they most bitterly regret. All will answer with one voice, so far as they have learned anything, their regret is &ldquo;not to have learned more.&rdquo;</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Learning Latin, even to speak it eloquently and to write it accurately, is not of itself education; even to read the sayings and writings of the wise and experienced dead, and to listen to the exhortations and suggestions of the noblest and most learned of living men, is not necessarily the essence of education. The underlying impulse of the student, the roots of his will, must be taken into account. Education is not the adornment of mental distinctions for the sake of popularity or reputation.&nbsp;It is not a class distinction. The real argument for education is that it makes a man a&nbsp;<em>better</em>&nbsp;man. If you use the word better it implies the&nbsp;<em>good</em>. Vives shows &ldquo;the good&rdquo; does not consist in riches, honours, position, or in learning merely, but in a keen intellect, wise mature judgment, religion, piety towards God, and in performance of duties towards one&rsquo;s country, one&rsquo;s dependants, one&rsquo;s parents, and in the cultivation of justice, temperance, liberality, magnanimity, equability of mind in calamity and brave bearing in adversity.&nbsp;</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>3. The teacher must be in constant touch with the real interests of the pupils. The teacher must be conscious of his/her methods of expression.</p>\n\n<p>4. How much detail should be supplied to the student?&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp; Less, because a lot of details could dampen the interest, could tire the brain, ...</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp; More, because less detail would lead to wrong conceptions, students will not ever endeavor to go beyond the limits, at least the student would become familiar with the vocabulary.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp; Choose the option based on your discernment, the situation, and how much you can observe the impact of your choice, but don&#39;t expect that student will be able to catch everything that you supply in the detail. And don&#39;t force beyond a limit!</p>\n\n<p>5. Point students&#39; interest in the direction of the source of the knowledge. The references of past writers, where did the ideas/knowledge come from, and how.</p>\n\n<p>6. Create the environment, or bring students to the environment in which the subject being learned is relatable. In case the environment is there but is taken for granted, remind them. For example, if life lessons are being discussed, make it relatable to daily life, point out the obvious.</p>\n\n<p>7. Behaviour of the teacher: The teacher must hold in mind the cause that he/she is working for which is &#39;carry forward learning&#39;. But from time to time, he must mingle with the students in a way that they find him relatable. The teacher must strive to reduce the psychological distance between himself and the students, as well as among students. Having a sense of humor is always helpful.</p>\n\n<p>Drama as a literary method: .....</p>\n\n<p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">One interesting thing about drama is that the purpose of it is served only when there is intelligent investment from writers and intelligent response from the audience. It should be noted how much the actors understand the elements of the writing, how much are they embodying it, how much understanding they gain, otherwise it would be just a silly play, which is good for kids!</p>\n\n<p>8. Idea of School:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>&ldquo;true academy is&nbsp;the association together and fellow sympathy of men equally good and learned, who have come together themselves for the sake of learning, and to render the same blessing to others.&rdquo;&nbsp; - Vives</p>\n\n<p>For Vives,&nbsp;it is a defect in education to isolate the young from the old, the old from the young.</p>\n\n<p>If all be bent on learning and scholarship, the differences of age disappear as clearly as the differences of rank and wealth.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Should older men go to school? ....</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>The idea of Academy (combination of Elementary, Secondary, and University):&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>putting a child in Academy from infancy. Education is a continuous life-long process, and an academy/school&nbsp;should embody and make facilities for the achievement of that idea.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>9.&nbsp;Exposure of the students to the <em>&#39;things&#39;</em>&nbsp;related to the subject they are studying.</p>\n\n<p>Exposure of the students to the <em>&#39;lives&#39;</em>&nbsp;related to the saintly,&nbsp;good, bad, evil, strong, weak, wise, ignorant, etc.</p>\n\n<p>Exposure of the students to the mother of everything -&nbsp;<em>nature</em>.</p>\n\n<p>Exposure of the students to the cause of everything - <em>Thought</em>.</p>\n\n<p>Exposure of the students to the means of action - <em>Body</em>.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://youtu.be/y6hpWjWtZ8s\">Strictness</a></p>\n\n<p>Non-strictness.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>10.

Behavior Management of students:</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>12. Environment:</p>\n\n<p>Instead of providing everything necessary right away, keep the things ready, but make the students feel the need for it. Let them come up with the ideas, and then introduce the infrastructure gradually.</p>\n\n<p>Even simple acts as making children&nbsp;sit on the table/chair in a particular arrangement, without explaining the need for it, induces an inhibiting nature of creativity.</p>\n\n<p>See the environment and inhabitants as a unified system rather than the environment being passive and habitants being active. The environment can be seen as providing feedback, new information to the habitant.</p>\n\n<p>What about school buildings?</p>\n\n<p>The design influences and shapes expectations and guide patterns of learning (Clark&nbsp;<a aria-controls=\"popup-references\" aria-expanded=\"false\" href=\"https://link.springer.com/referenceworkentry/10.1007/978-981-13-2262-4_190-1#CR2\" role=\"button\" title=\"View reference\">2016</a>)</p>\n\n<p>Maybe the building itself should somehow reflect freedom and creativity.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>12. Language &amp; Communication:</p>\n\n<p>Intercultural, Interdisciplinary communication.</p>\n\n<p>Communication over language.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>13. Use of Technology in Learning:</p>\n\n<p>As with any other technology, educational technologies are neutral. They may or may not be useful and effective based on their use. They may cause benefit or harm based on how they are used.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Ubiquitous learning: with the help of technology, anybody can learn anything, anytime, anywhere as opposed to classroom settings. What does it mean and what are its implications?</p>\n\n<p>Information is at your fingertips. What does that mean and what are its implications?</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Project-based Learning:&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>...................</p>\n\n<p>Technologies enable Multimodal learning. Multimodality can include five modes: visual mode, aural mode, gestural mode, spatial mode, and linguistic mode. Multimodal meaning-making also builds on the field of Multiple Intelligence Theory.</p>\n\n<p>Technological assessment systems provide a continuous machine-mediated human assessment from multiple perspectives (peers, self, teacher, parents, invited experts, etc.) and machine feedback (selected and supply response assessments, natural language processing). Student performance can further be evaluated through data mining of their activity data to provide details of individual progress or comparisons across cohorts. This technology affords just-in-time feedback, or assessment for learning (formative assessment) and not just of learning (summative assessment) (Cope and Kalantzis&nbsp;<a aria-controls=\"popup-references\" aria-expanded=\"false\" href=\"https://link.springer.com/referenceworkentry/10.1007/978-981-13-2262-4_135-1#CR2\" role=\"button\" title=\"View reference\">2017</a>).</p>\n\n<p>Modern communication technology enhances the capability for collaboration and networking around a task and affords the capacity for production and co-production.&nbsp;&nbsp;Collaborative work brings different experiences and perspectives together to produce collaborative intelligence where different inputs often create higher standards and increase the depth of knowledge and build a sense of community of peers around the knowledge.</p>\n\n<p>Technology allows the tailoring of learning experiences and instructions, so learners no longer have to sit in the classroom, waiting for the teacher to attend to them. Instead, technology provides affordances for ensuring that all learners can be engaged, can ask questions, get feedback, track individual performance, and tailor material and tests to individual needs.</p>\n\n<p>Augmented reality (AR) technology in education, including both image-based AR and location-based AR, may result in different affordances for learning. Image-based AR supports spatial ability, practical skills, and conceptual understanding, and location-based AR usually supports inquiry-based scientific activities. This technology provides customizable environments and the development of visualization tools to enhance spatial understanding. For example, computer simulations can visualize invisible phenomena and provide opportunities for manipulating experimental variables which could have positive learning effects. Also, immersive experiences afforded by AR technology allow for the permeating of digital information throughout the real world, which engages learners in an immersive context along with authentic experiences. Learning affordances of 3-D virtual environments include the enablement of tasks that lead to enhanced spatial knowledge representation, opportunities for experiential learning impossible in the real world, increased engagement, improved contextualization of learning, and improved collaborative learning than is possible with 2-D alternatives.</p>\n\n<p>Source:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://link.springer.com/referenceworkentry/10.1007/978-981-13-2262-4_135-1\">https://link.springer.com/referenceworkentry/10.1007/978-981-13-2262-4_135-1</a></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>A great technique for overall development could be like: Make a story out of a poem.

In focussed mode, the brain follows a fixed pattern of thoughts. Diffused mode is about a broader perspective, which can result in new ideas, new concepts. These modes are almost exclusive. That&#39;s why it&#39;s important to empty your mind.&nbsp;<strong>But, how to enter diffused mode? -&nbsp;</strong>By relaxing the mind, while focussing slightly on the problem.

Too little structure and they risk either taking a very long time to develop certain skills and acquire knowledge or not doing so at all because energy was spent elsewhere.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Similar to a Goldilocks principle, children need just the right amount of support from adults, to develop knowledge and skills through play (Alfieri et al.&nbsp;<a aria-controls=\"popup-references\" aria-expanded=\"false\" href=\"https://link.springer.com/referenceworkentry/10.1007/978-981-13-2262-4_13-1#CR1\" role=\"button\" title=\"View reference\">2011</a>).&nbsp;&nbsp;This can be in a goal-directed way (e.g., guided play, with teachers in classrooms; Weisberg et al.&nbsp;<a aria-controls=\"popup-references\" aria-expanded=\"false\" href=\"https://link.springer.com/referenceworkentry/10.1007/978-981-13-2262-4_13-1#CR8\" role=\"button\" title=\"View reference\">2016</a>) or in a more exploratory way (e.g., scaffolding and autonomy support, with parents at home; Bernier et al.&nbsp;<a aria-controls=\"popup-references\" aria-expanded=\"false\" href=\"https://link.springer.com/referenceworkentry/10.1007/978-981-13-2262-4_13-1#CR2\" role=\"button\" title=\"View reference\">2010</a>).</p>\n\n<p>Contingency:&nbsp;The idea is that the adult responds to the infant in a way that is both timely and appropriate. An example of this is when the infant smiles and then the adult smiles and strokes the infant&rsquo;s cheek. The response is immediate, and it is linked to the emotional warmth that both are feeling.&nbsp;Even without saying too much and giving the answer away, adults can engage in a back-and-forth that shows the child they are listening and his/her actions are being acknowledged. Being contingent can also mean adjusting the level of support based on the ongoing assessment of the child&rsquo;s needs (as in the concept of &ldquo;scaffolding&rdquo;).&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://link.springer.com/referenceworkentry/10.1007/978-981-13-2262-4_190-1\">Affordance Theory in Learning Environment</a>:</p>\n\n<p>The effect of environment (and the resources available in it) on functions, behavior, disposition, perception, and culture.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<hr />\n<p><a href=\"https://books.google.co.in/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=LAgUbT5pYXUC&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PP1&amp;dq=dreikurs+goal+centred+theory&amp;ots=v_dhbf6clT&amp;sig=aVHi0ZyWjGlr7laZ8Vh_FESPgOw#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=true\">Book: Maintaining Sanity in Classroom</a>&nbsp;(Student-Centric Teaching)</p>\n\n<p>Development of a child&#39;s potential: Nature vs Nurture.</p>\n\n<p>Identifying the potential.</p>\n\n<p>Identifying artistic ability and creativity of young children.</p>\n\n<p>Identifying the sense of innate identity and direction in young children.</p>\n\n<p>Identifying how do children learn:</p>\n\n<p>- Socialisation</p>\n\n<p>- Goal-oriented pattern formation through trial and error.

The goal of the behavior itself is the cause.</p>\n\n<p>A person&#39;s actions reflect his intentions/goals, not necessarily conscious intentions. Similarly is the case with the children.</p>\n\n<p>Humans are social beings with the overriding goal of belonging and finding a place in society. If a child learns anti-social and disturbing means and ways by which he tries to be significant, it means there&#39;s an error in the child&#39;s comprehension of life and its necessities.</p>\n\n<p>All the individual&#39;s actions, qualities, characteristics, and emotions can be understood by his efforts to find a place for himself in society. However, a child&#39;s actions and choices may be based on faulty assumptions he has made. In his own logical framework, this might be the most appropriate choice/action.</p>\n\n<p>Faulty assumptions result from biased perception. Being objective in any evaluation is difficult.</p>\n\n<p>Asking a child why he does something wrong is useless because he doesn&#39;t know why he does it. How he looks at everything in life depends on his private logic. An educator must be able to make the child know himself better, understand himself, his way of thinking, his goals, etc.</p>\n\n<p>Parent&#39;s reactions to a child&#39;s behavior are a guiding factor for developing habits.</p>\n\n<p>There are 4 goals for disturbing behaviors:</p>\n\n<p>1. To gain attention, 2. To seek power, 3. To seek revenge, 4. To display inadequacy (real or imagined)</p>\n\n<p>The well-adjusted child finds his way towards social acceptance through his concern for the welfare of the group, family, or school and through his useful contributions. The child who misbehaves has lost his belief that he can find the&nbsp;belonging and recognition that he desires and erroneously believes that he would find acceptance through provocative behavior by pursuing the mistaken goals of behavior.</p>\n\n<p>Some manifestations of children:</p>\n\n<ol>\n\t<li>Nuisance in class</li>\n\t<li>Show off</li>\n\t<li>Laziness</li>\n\t<li>&quot;Uses&quot; others</li>\n\t<li>Keeps teacher busy</li>\n\t<li>Cries</li>\n\t<li>Tries to use charm</li>\n\t<li>Overly eager to please</li>\n\t<li>Overly sensitive</li>\n\t<li>Stubborn</li>\n\t<li>Argues a lot</li>\n\t<li>Acts like a boss</li>\n\t<li>Lies</li>\n\t<li>Is disobedient</li>\n\t<li>Likes to be in control</li>\n\t<li>Steals</li>\n\t<li>Is vicious</li>\n\t<li>Hurts children and animals</li>\n\t<li>Is destructive</li>\n\t<li>May hold a grudge, thinking that nobody likes him</li>\n\t<li>Tries to take revenge</li>\n\t<li>Feels helpless, inferior, stupid</li>\n\t<li>Gives up, doesn&#39;t participate in any activities</li>\n\t<li>Feels best when left alone and no demand is made of him</li>\n\t<li>May set too high goals for himself, does not touch anything that is not up to his self-expectations</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Children develop a concept of fairness very early. But like other concepts, this one can be based on false assumptions.</p>\n\n<p>Even a revengeful child, who generally presents the most disturbing behavior patterns, can become adequately adjusted if he can be convinced that he is liked and can be useful.</p>\n\n<p>Humiliation and punishment do not matter as long as he achieves his purpose.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>A child who is competitive may even feel discouraged when another child catches up with him.</p>\n\n<p>It doesn&#39;t help to engage in a power contest with power-oriented children. Because ultimately the adult has to be an adult and act responsibly. The child doesn&#39;t understand any responsibility.</p>\n\n<p>Why does a child seek power? Because he is ambitious, his ambition is directed towards those who try to suppress him. What does he get in defeating the adult? Status among the peers. This has to be solved on a group level, try to re-orient the values of not only that child but the entire class.</p>\n\n<p>The child may feel that he is being treated unfairly, his emotions being disregarded, and he may seek revenge. They may develop the notion that &quot;if others have the right to hurt me, I have the right to hurt others&quot;. Revenge-seeking behavior is hard to change. It requires real understanding, empathy, patience.</p>\n\n<p>Instead of pitching one against the other, we have to teach children to be their brothers&#39; keepers.</p>\n\n<p>The teacher may know what child seeks by observing their own first reaction. E.g. if the teacher feels threatened, or challenged in position because of non-cooperation of a child, he is dealing with a child whose goal is power.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Goals may change though from situation to situation, even within seconds.</p>\n\n<p>If a child responds to reprimand and stops the act, it means he was seeking attention. He might do so again.</p>\n\n<p>If a child continues to do his act after reprimand or intensifies it, it means he is seeking power over the adult.</p>\n\n<p>If the child becomes abusive, angry, feels unjustly accused, he is seeking revenge.</p>\n\n<p>If a child does nothing and just sits after being reprimanded, he is feeling inadequate.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Recognition Reflex:</p>\n\n<p>Younger children will either admit that they do the misbehavior for the reason we have suggested or they give themselves away through some facial or bodily mannerism known as Recognition Reflex. Either a grin, embarrassed laughter, or a twinkle in the eye.</p>\n\n<p>Older children won&#39;t admit this. But still, their body signals somehow. Their lips may twitch, their eyes may blink or bat more frequently, they may readjust their seating position, swing a leg, tap with their fingers or even wiggle their toes.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Do you know why you .....&quot; (They don&#39;t know, but still it&#39;s good to set the stage for conversation)</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Here&#39;s what I think....&quot;</p>\n\n<p>Handling attention-seeking:</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>Initial stage: Ignoring technique</li>\n\t<li>Later stage: Timely follow-up, one-on-one session. Seek student&#39;s cooperation through dialogue.</li>\n\t<li>If attention is reinforced by peers, either remove the offender from the classroom or deprive him of group attention. Or, group contingency, i.e. whole group is rewarded for the misbehavior of one.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Attractive and varying activities, involving good success and immediate positive rewards (even if small rewards like verbal encouragement) make sure that all students are challenged and involved while none are overwhelmed.</p>\n\n<p>According to Kounin, (cited in Roffey, 2004, p. 50), an effective teacher has well-planned routines. He is well prepared and gives attention to individuals and groups. Lets students know by eye contact or gestures that he is aware of unwanted behavior. Pays minimal attention to minor disruptions and provides positive feedback.</p>\n\n<p>The teacher has to be careful about the feelings both emotional and intellectual (Glasser, 1986). Students always enjoy working with teachers who have a sense of humor, who can utilize funny phrases and facial expressions which help to create warmth and defuse tension.</p>\n\n<p>Discipline ladder:</p>\n\n<p>\uf0b7 The corrective look. \uf0b7 Corrective hand sign. \uf0b7 Rule reminder (Rogers, 2006, p. 79). \uf0b7 Change of place to stop reinforcers. \uf0b7 Punishments exercises. \uf0b7 Repeated warnings. \uf0b7 Time-out/detention. \uf0b7 Letter to parents to seek their help. \uf0b7 Referral to the headteacher. \uf0b7 One-day exclusion. \uf0b7 Two days exclusion. \uf0b7 Five days exclusion. \uf0b7 Permanent exclusion</p>\n\n<p>In addition, there should be a complaints mechanism (Strut, n.d.) to augment the discipline ladder.</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;One obvious source of behavior problems can be the lesson and the quality of teaching.&rdquo; David Wright (Wright, 2006, p. 45). Therefore there should be a strong lesson plan and must be followed in true spirit as far as possible. Of various types of lesson plans the most frequently referred to is the &ldquo;developmental lesson&rdquo; (Kraut, 2000). Lesson plans may consist of the following components: \uf0b7</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>Lesson objectives: demonstrated in student&rsquo;s performance and evaluated by the teacher (Kraut, 2000, p. 38).</li>\n\t<li>Lesson materials needed: tangible and sometimes intangible objects required to help achieve objectives of the lesson. \uf0b7</li>\n\t<li>Lesson Aim: it is a statement informing the class of a lesson&rsquo;s purpose. \uf0b7</li>\n\t<li>Warm-up: This is a sort of motivational device which helps students recap their knowledge about the topic and related ideas. \uf0b7</li>\n\t<li>Activities: actual activities which a teacher may envisage to be helpful. \uf0b7</li>\n\t<li>Feedback and Closure: this part consists of correcting the mistakes or reinforcing the idea conveyed in the lesson. Closure contains an introduction to the next lesson to help pupils think in advance.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>A knowledgeable teacher seldom faces behavior problems as he keeps students actively involved in the learning process as he is well aware of the fact that an empty mind is a devil&rsquo;s workshop. He has the ability to come down to the level of students and start developing from that very level.</p>\n\n<p>A teacher may help nurture the qualities of investigation and creativity, utilizing library resources by giving them a reference to the material appropriate to their age and educational level.</p>\n\n<p>Learning best takes place in a healthy atmosphere of the class so a teacher should encourage fun and variety in the teaching environment.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<hr />\n<h2><a href=\"https://vinaire.me/2014/04/21/5-alternative-teaching-methods/\" target=\"_blank\">5 Alternative Teaching&nbsp;Methods</a></h2>\n\n<ol>\n\t<li>\n\t<p>MONTESSORI</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p>STEINER/WALDORF</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p>HARKNESS</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p>REGGIO EMILIA</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p>SUDBURY</p>\n\t</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<hr />\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://link.springer.com/search?facet-discipline=%22Education%22\">https://link.springer.com/search?facet-discipline=%22Education%22</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-981-15-5963-1\">https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-981-15-5963-1</a></p>\n\n<hr />\n<p>Wikipedia Links:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Education#Mind,_brain,_and_education\">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Education#Mind,_brain,_and_education</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence-based_education\">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence-based_education</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microteaching\">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microteaching</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pedagogy\">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pedagogy</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Didactic_method\">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Didactic_method</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bildung\">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bildung</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Educational_psychology\">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Educational_psychology</a></p>\n\n<p>Other Links:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://edutechwiki.unige.ch/en/Discovery_learning\">http://edutechwiki.unige.ch/en/Discovery_learning</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/computer-science/discovery-learning\">https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/computer-science/discovery-learning</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://icdtranslation.com/discovery-based-and-inquiry-based-learning/\">http://icdtranslation.com/discovery-based-and-inquiry-based-learning/</a></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Education of great scientists:</p>\n\n<p>Richard Feynman:</p>\n\n<p>1. Self-motivated experiments - with Radio, and related stuff.</p>\n\n<p>2. Algebra in his classroom - The teacher used to play games where the teacher wrote the problem on the board, they had to write answers on a small piece of paper, within 45 seconds. There was not enough paper to follow to the conventional approach to solve the problems like &quot;Suppose A = ..., B = .. and so on&quot;. So, they learned how to <em>see</em> the solution, rather than solving it.</p>\n\n<p>3. He had learned all the puzzles famous by that time.</p>\n\n<p>4. He figured out most of the trigonometric relations on his own, many a time finding simpler demonstrations than those available in books and were taught in classes.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>5. He invented his own symbols as a replacement for sin(x), cos, f(x), etc because these are confusing like sin(x) seems like s times i times n times x.</p>\n\n<p>6.&nbsp;He did many experiments just for fun.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Richard Feynman had the drive to figure out what&#39;s the matter with this, like a puzzle. And he had the persistence to work on it.</p>\n\n<p>His life was full of little adventures from childhood. He did many jobs. In many of his jobs, he tried to <em>innovate (</em>often causing inconvenience to others. &quot;I learned there that innovation is a very difficult thing in the real world.&quot;).&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Wasn&#39;t much social, but found a great fraternity that had two groups, one of the students who only studied, the other who had only fun, and somehow they decided to help each other.</p>\n\n<p>He had read some of the concepts in Encyclopedia, In his fraternity, he once helped his senior roommates with their&nbsp;physics problems,&nbsp;after which his seniors discussed their physics problems with him.</p>\n\n<p>He was mischievous, he played pranks.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;I didn&#39;t care, when I met somebody, where they were from, or what their background was, so I would go to these dances &shy;&shy; even though my fraternity brothers disapproved (I was a junior by this time, and they couldn&#39;t stop me) &shy;&shy; and I had a very good time.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>He did chemistry &quot;magic&quot; to show off.</p>\n\n<pre>\n&quot;I often liked to play tricks on people when I was at MIT. One time, in mechanical drawing class, some joker picked up a French curve (a piece of plastic for drawing smooth curves &shy;&shy; a curly, funny&shy;looking thing) and \nsaid, &quot;I wonder if the curves on this thing have some special formula?&quot; I thought for a moment and said, &quot;Sure they do. The curves are very special curves. Lemme show ya,&quot; \nand I picked up my French curve and began to turn it slowly. &quot;The French curve is made so that at the lowest point on each curve, no matter how you turn it, the tangent is horizontal.&quot; \nAll the guys in the class were holding their French curve up at different angles, holding their pencil up to it at the lowest point and laying it along, and discovering that, sure enough, the tangent is horizontal. \nThey were all excited by this &quot;discovery&quot; &shy;&shy; even though they had already gone through a certain amount of calculus and had already &quot;learned&quot; that the derivative (tangent) of the minimum (lowest point) of any curve is zero (horizontal). They didn&#39;t put two and two together. They didn&#39;t even know what they &quot;knew.&quot; I don&#39;t know what&#39;s the matter with people: they don&#39;t learn by understanding; they learn by some other way &shy;&shy; by rote, or something. Their knowledge is so fragile!&quot;\n\n</pre>\n\n<pre>\nHe tried to escape non-science classes. &quot;Before I tell you what happened in philosophy, let me tell you about the English class. We had to write a number of themes. For instance, Mill had written something on liberty, and we had to criticize it. But instead of addressing myself to political liberty, as Mill did, I wrote about liberty in social occasions &shy;&shy; the problem of having to fake and lie in order to be polite, and does this perpetual game of faking in social situations lead to the &quot;destruction of the moral fiber of society.&quot; An interesting question, but not the one we were supposed to discuss.&quot;</pre>\n\n<p>&quot;And after talking to myself many times like that, I became less and less afraid, and in fact, I found the process of waking up rather thrilling &shy;&shy; something like a roller coaster: After a while, you&#39;re not so scared, and you begin to enjoy it a little bit.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>He took a job as &quot;Chief Chemist Researcher&quot; in his friend&#39;s company, and did a pretty good job.</p>\n\n<p>Then I said, &quot;It seems to me that no matter what you say about poetry, I could find a way of making up an analog with any subject, just as I did for theoretical physics. I&nbsp;don&#39;t consider such analogs meaningful.</p>\n\n<p>Hypnosis experience of Feynman.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;But that was my big moment: I gave a seminar in the biology department of Harvard! I always do that, get into something and see how far I can go.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>His encounter with a painter arguing that he can produce yellow pain from red and white. Feynman knew that pink was possible (he had studied light), but yellow? not possible. Still, he wanted to see, only to find out that the painter needed some (little) yellow to make yellow paint. [People, experienced in their fields, who do not pay much attention to theory, often ignore some crucial facts]</p>\n\n<p>&quot;I had a scheme, which I still use today when somebody is explaining something that I&#39;m trying to understand: I keep making up examples. For instance, the mathematicians would come in with a terrific theorem, and they&#39;re all excited. As they&#39;re telling me the conditions of the theorem, I construct something which fits all the conditions. You know, you have a set (one ball) &shy;&shy; disjoint (two balls). Then the balls turn colors, grow hairs, or whatever, in my head as they put more conditions on. Finally, they state the theorem, which is some dumb thing about the ball which isn&#39;t true for my hairy green ball thing, so I say, &quot;False!&quot;</p>\n\n<p>He used to get most of the guesses right about mathematical problems, even though he didn&#39;t know the details of them.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;So because I was self&shy;taught using that book, I had peculiar methods of doing integrals. The result was when guys at MIT or Princeton had trouble doing a certain integral, it was because they couldn&#39;t do it with the standard methods they had learned in school. If it was contour integration, they would have found it; if it was a simple series&nbsp;expansion, they would have found it. Then I come along and try differentiating under the integral sign, and often it worked. So I got a great reputation for doing integrals, only because my box of tools was different from everybody else&#39;s, and they had tried all their tools on it before giving the problem to me&quot;</p>\n\n<p>&quot;When I was a kid I had a &quot;lab.&quot; It wasn&#39;t a laboratory in the sense that I would measure, or do important experiments. Instead, I would play: I&#39;d make a motor, I&#39;d make a gadget that would go off when something passed a photocell. I&#39;d play around with selenium; I was piddling around all the time. I did calculate a little bit for the lamp bank, a series of switches, and bulbs I used as resistors to control voltages. But all that was for application. I never did any laboratory kind of experiments. I also had a microscope and loved to watch things under the microscope. It took patience: I would get something under the microscope and I would watch it interminably. I saw many interesting things like everybody sees &shy;&shy; a diatom slowly making its way across the slide, and so on.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>&quot;The thing [dragonfly]&nbsp;landed on my foot. Everybody was yelling and it was a big mess because this darning needle was sitting on my foot. And there I was, this scientific wonder, saying it wasn&#39;t going to sting me. You&#39;re sure this is a story that&#39;s going to come out that it stings me &shy;&shy; but it didn&#39;t. The book was right. But I did sweat a bit.&quot; [His belief in science + courage]</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.feynmanlectures.caltech.edu/\">Feynman&#39;s Lectures</a>:&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n", "authorId": 1, "subject": "philosophy", "tags": [], "img": "", "summary": "string", "lastUpdated": "2023-07-04 17:42:12.606951"}
