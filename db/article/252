{"name": "The Myth Of Sisyphus", "id": 252, "content": "<p>Is life worth or not worth living?</p>\n\n<p>Is this question most fundamental/urgent question in philosophy?</p>\n\n<p>An act like this (suicide) is prepared within the silence of the heart, as is a great work of art. The man himself is ignorant of it.<br />\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[There are counter-examples though]</p>\n\n<p>Rarely is suicide committed (yet the hypothesis is not excluded) through reflection.</p>\n\n<p>But one would have to know whether a friend of the desperate man had not that very day addressed him indifferently. [Little things triggering big effects]</p>\n\n<p>... killing yourself amounts to confessing. It is confessing that life is too much for you or that you do not understand it.. or &quot;is not worth the trouble.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>Living, naturally, is never easy.</p>\n\n<p>Dying voluntarily implies that you have recognized, even instinctively, [6] the ridiculous character of that habit, the absence of any profound reason for living, the insane character of that daily agitation, and the uselessness of suffering.</p>\n\n<p>In a man&#39; s attachment to life there is something stronger than all the ills in the world. The body&#39; s judgment is as good as the mind&#39;s, and the body shrinks from annihilation. We get into the habit of living before acquiring the habit of thinking.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;The typical act of eluding, the fatal evasion that constitutes the third theme of this essay, is hope. Hope of another life one must &quot;deserve&quot; or trickery of those who live not for life itself but for some great idea that will transcend it, refine it, give it a meaning, and betray it.</p>\n\n<p>people have played on words and pretended to believe that refusing to grant a meaning to life necessarily leads to declaring that it is not worth living.</p>\n\n<p>But does that insult to existence, that flat denial in which it is plunged come from the fact that it has no meaning? Does its absurdity require one to [9] escape it through hope or suicide&mdash;this is what must be clarified, hunted down, and elucidated while brushing aside all the rest. Does the Absurd dictate death?</p>\n\n<p>There is thus a lower key of feelings, inaccessible in the heart but partially disclosed by the acts they imply and the attitudes of mind they assume. It is clear that in this way I am defining a method.<br />\nThe method<br />\ndefined here acknowledges the feeling that all true knowledge is impossible. Solely appearances can be<br />\nenumerated and the climate make itself felt.</p>\n\n<p>Likewise and during every day of an unillustrious life, time carries us. .. Tomorrow, he was longing for<br />\ntomorrow, whereas everything in him ought to reject it. That revolt of the flesh is the absurd.</p>\n\n<p>Cases of absurdity:<br />\n[Losing connection with the world:]<br />\nJust as there are days when under the familiar face of a woman, we see as a stranger her we had loved<br />\nmonths or years ago, perhaps we shall come even to desire what suddenly leaves us so alone. But the time has<br />\nnot yet come. Just one thing: that denseness and that strangeness of the world is the absurd.</p>\n\n<p><br />\nA man is talking on the<br />\ntelephone behind a glass partition; you cannot hear him, but you see his incomprehensible dumb show: you<br />\nwonder why he is alive. This discomfort in the face of man&#39; s own inhumanity, this incalculable tumble before<br />\nthe image of what we are, this &quot;nausea,&quot; as a writer of today calls it, is also the absurd. Likewise the stranger<br />\nwho at certain seconds comes to meet us in a mirror, the familiar and yet alarming brother we encounter in our<br />\nown photographs is also the absurd.</p>\n\n<p>No code of<br />\nethics and no effort are justifiable a priori in the face of the cruel mathematics that command our<br />\ncondition [time decreasing and leading us to death].</p>\n\n<p>Likewise, the mind that aims to understand reality can<br />\nconsider itself satisfied only by reducing it to terms of thought. If man realized that the universe like him<br />\ncan love and suffer, he would be reconciled. If thought discovered in the shimmering mirrors of<br />\nphenomena eternal relations capable of summing them up and summing themselves up in a single<br />\nprinciple, then would be seen an intellectual joy of which the myth of the blessed would be but a<br />\nridiculous imitation. That nostalgia for unity, that appetite for the absolute illustrates the essential impulse<br />\nof the human drama. But the fact of that nostalgia&#39; s existence does not imply that it is to be immediately<br />\nsatisfied. For if, bridging the gulf that separates desire from conquest, we assert with Parmenides the<br />\nreality of the One (whatever it may be), [18] we fall into the ridiculous contradiction of a mind that asserts total<br />\nunity and proves by its very assertion its own difference and the diversity it claimed to resolve. This other vicious<br />\ncircle is enough to stifle our hopes.</p>\n\n<p><br />\n&nbsp;Of whom and of what indeed can I say: &quot;I know that!&quot; This heart within me I can feel, and I judge that it<br />\nexists. This world I can touch, and I likewise judge that it exists. There ends all my knowledge, and the rest is<br />\nconstruction. For if I try to seize this self of which I feel sure, if I try to define and to summarize it, it is nothing<br />\nbut water slipping through my fingers. I can sketch one by one all the aspects it is able to assume, all those<br />\nlikewise that have been attributed to it, this up bringing, this origin, this ardor or these silences, this nobility or<br />\nthis vileness. But aspects cannot be added up. This very heart which is mine will forever remain indefinable to<br />\nme. Between the certainty I have of my existence and the content I try to give to that assurance, the gap will<br />\nnever be filled. Forever I shall be a stranger to myself. In psychology as in logic, there are truths but no truth.<br />\nSocrates&#39; &quot;Know thyself&quot; has as much value as the &quot;Be virtuous&quot; of our confessionals. They reveal a nostalgia at<br />\nthe same time as an ignorance. They are sterile exercises on great subjects. They are legitimate only in precisely<br />\nso far as they are approximate</p>\n\n<p><br />\nAnd here are trees and I know their gnarled surface, water and I feel its taste. These scents of grass and stars<br />\nat night, certain evenings when the heart relaxes &mdash;how shall I negate this world whose power and strength I<br />\nfeel? Yet all the knowledge on earth will give me nothing to assure me that this world is mine. You describe it to<br />\nme and you teach me to classify it. You enumerate its laws and in my thirst for knowledge I admit that they are<br />\ntrue. You take apart its mechanism and my hope increases. At the final stage you teach me that this wondrous<br />\n[20] and multicolored universe can be reduced to the atom and that the atom itself can be reduced to the<br />\nelectron. All this is good and I wait for you to continue. But you tell me of an invisible planetary system in<br />\nwhich electrons gravitate around a nucleus. You explain this world to me with an image. I realize then that you<br />\nhave been reduced to poetry: I shall never know. Have I the time to become indignant? You have already<br />\nchanged theories. So that science that was to teach me everything ends up in a hypothesis, that lucidity founders<br />\nin metaphor, that uncertainty is resolved in a work of art. What need had I of so many efforts? The soft lines of<br />\nthese hills and the hand of evening on this troubled heart teach me much more. I have returned to my<br />\nbeginning. I realize that if through science I can seize phenomena and enumerate them, I cannot, for all<br />\nthat, apprehend the world. Were I to trace its entire relief with my finger, I should not know any more. And<br />\nyou give me the choice between a description that is sure but that teaches me nothing and hypotheses that<br />\nclaim to teach me but that are not sure. A stranger to myself and to the world, armed solely with a thought<br />\nthat negates itself as soon as it asserts, what is this condition in which I can have peace only by refusing to<br />\nknow and to live, in which the appetite for conquest bumps into walls that defy its assaults? To will is to stir<br />\nup paradoxes. Everything is ordered in such a way as to bring into being that poisoned peace produced by<br />\nthoughtlessness, lack of heart, or fatal renunciations.</p>\n\n<p><br />\nHence the intelligence, too, tells me in its way that this world is absurd. Its contrary, blind reason, may<br />\nwell [21] claim that all is clear; I was waiting for proof and longing for it to be right. But despite so many<br />\npretentious centuries and over the heads of so many eloquent and persuasive men, I know that is false. On this<br />\nplane, at least, there is no happiness if I cannot know. That universal reason, practical or ethical, that<br />\ndeterminism, those categories that explain everything are enough to make a decent man laugh. They have<br />\nnothing to do with the mind. They negate its profound truth, which is to be enchained. In this unintelligible and<br />\nlimited universe, man&#39;s fate henceforth assumes its meaning. A horde of irrationals has sprung up and surrounds<br />\nhim until his ultimate end. In his recovered and now studied lucidity, the feeling of the absurd becomes clear<br />\nand definite. I said that the world is absurd, but I was too hasty. This world in itself is not reasonable, that is all<br />\nthat can be said. But what is absurd is the confrontation of this irrational and the wild longing for clarity whose<br />\ncall echoes in the human heart. The absurd depends as much on man as on the world. For the moment it is all<br />\nthat links them together. It binds them one to the other as only hatred can weld two creatures together</p>\n\n<p>Jaspers despairs of any ontology because he claims that we have lost &quot;na&iuml;vet&eacute;.&quot; He knows that we<br />\ncan achieve nothing that will transcend the fatal game of [25] appearances. He knows that the end of the<br />\nmind is failure. He tarries over the spiritual adventures revealed by history and pitilessly discloses the<br />\nflaw in each system, the illusion that saved everything, the preaching that hid nothing. In this ravaged<br />\nworld in which the impossibility of knowledge is established, in which everlasting nothingness seems the<br />\nonly reality and irremediable despair seems the only attitude, he tries to recover the Ariadne&#39;s thread that<br />\nleads to divine secrets.</p>\n\n<p>Chestov, for his part, throughout a wonderfully monotonous work, constantly straining toward the same<br />\ntruths, tirelessly demonstrates that the tightest system, the most universal rationalism always stumbles<br />\neventually on the irrational of human thought. None of the ironic facts or ridiculous contradictions that<br />\ndepreciate the reason escapes him. One thing only interests him, and that is the exception, whether in the<br />\ndomain of the heart or of the mind. Through the Dostoevskian experiences of the condemned man, the<br />\nexacerbated adventures of the Nietzschean mind, Hamlet&#39; s imprecations, or the bitter aristocracy of an<br />\nIbsen, he tracks down, illuminates, and magnifies the human revolt against the irremediable. He refuses the<br />\nreason its reasons and begins to advance with some decision only in the middle of that colorless desert where all<br />\ncertainties have become stones.</p>\n\n<p>How can one fail to feel the basic relationship of these minds! How can one fail to see that they take<br />\ntheir stand around a privileged and bitter moment in which hope has no further place? I want everything<br />\nto be explained to me or nothing. And the reason is impotent when it hears this cry from the heart. The<br />\nmind aroused by this insistence seeks and finds nothing but contradictions and nonsense. What I fail to<br />\nunderstand is nonsense. The world is peopled with such irrationals. The world itself, whose single<br />\nmeaning I do not understand, is but a vast irrational. If one could only say just once: &quot;This is clear,&quot; all<br />\nwould be saved. But these men vie with one another in proclaiming that nothing is clear, all is chaos, that<br />\nall man has is his lucidity and his definite knowledge of the walls surrounding him.</p>\n\n<p><br />\n..At this point of his effort man stands face to face with the irrational. He feels<br />\nwithin him his longing for happiness and for reason. The absurd is born of this confrontation between the<br />\nhuman need and the unreasonable silence of the world. This must not be forgotten. This must be clung to<br />\nbecause the whole consequence of a life can depend on it. The irrational, the human nostalgia, and the<br />\nabsurd that is born of their encounter&mdash;these are the three characters in the drama that must necessarily<br />\nend with all the logic of which an existence is capable.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;It&#39;s absurd&quot; means &quot;It&#39;s impossible&quot; but also<br />\n&quot;It&#39;s contradictory.&quot; If I see a man armed only with a sword attack a group of machine guns, I shall<br />\nconsider his act to be absurd. But it is so solely by virtue of the disproportion between his intention and<br />\nthe reality he will encounter, of the contradiction I notice between his true strength and the aim he has in<br />\nview. Likewise we shall deem a verdict absurd when we contrast it with the verdict the facts apparently<br />\ndictated. And, similarly, a demonstration by the absurd is achieved by comparing the consequences of<br />\nsuch a reasoning with the logical reality one wants to [30] set up. In all these cases, from the simplest to<br />\nthe most complex, the magnitude of the absurdity will be in direct ratio to the distance between the two<br />\nterms of my comparison. There are absurd marriages, challenges, rancors, silences, wars, and even peace<br />\ntreaties. For each of them the absurdity springs from a comparison. I am thus justified in saying that the<br />\nfeeling of absurdity does not spring from the mere scrutiny of a fact or an impression, but that it bursts from<br />\nthe comparison between a bare fact and a certain reality, between an action and the world that transcends it.<br />\nThe absurd is essentially a divorce. It lies in neither of the elements compared; it is born of their<br />\nconfrontation....</p>\n\n<p>[Clarifying on the meaning of absurd]</p>\n\n<p><br />\n&quot;Does not the failure reveal, beyond any possible [33] explanation and<br />\ninterpretation, not the absence but the existence of transcendence?&quot; That existence which, suddenly and<br />\nthrough a blind act of human confidence, explains everything, he defines as &quot;the unthinkable unity of the<br />\ngeneral and the particular.&quot; Thus the absurd becomes god (in the broadest meaning of this word) and that<br />\ninability to understand becomes the existence that illuminates everything. Nothing logically prepares this<br />\nreasoning. I can call it a leap.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;The only true solution,&quot; he said,<br />\n&quot;is precisely where human judgment sees no solution. Otherwise, what need would we have of God? We turn<br />\ntoward God only to obtain the impossible. As for the possible, men suffice.&quot; If there is a Chestovian philosophy,<br />\nI can say that it is altogether summed up in this way. For when, at the conclusion of his passionate analyses,<br />\nChestov discovers the fundamental absurdity of all existence, he does not say: &quot;This is the absurd,&quot; but rather:<br />\n&quot;This is God: we must rely on him even if he does not correspond to any of our rational categories.&quot;<br />\nSo that<br />\nconfusion may not be possible, the Russian philosopher even hints that this God is perhaps full of hatred and<br />\nhateful, incomprehensible and contradictory; but the more hideous is his face, the more he asserts his power. His<br />\ngreatness is his incoherence. His proof is his inhumanity. One must spring into him and by this leap free oneself<br />\nfrom rational illusions.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>To an absurd mind reason<br />\nis useless and there is nothing beyond reason.</p>\n\n<p>The laws of nature may be operative up to a certain<br />\nlimit, beyond which they turn against themselves to give birth to the absurd. Or else, they may justify<br />\nthemselves on the level of description without for that reason being true on the level of explanation. [37]<br />\nEverything is sacrificed here to the irrational, and, the demand for clarity being conjured away, the absurd<br />\ndisappears with one of the terms of its comparison. The absurd man, on the other hand, does not<br />\nundertake such a leveling process. He recognizes the struggle, does not absolutely scorn reason, and<br />\nadmits the irrational. Thus he again embraces in a single glance all the data of experience and he is little<br />\ninclined to leap before knowing. He knows simply that in that alert awareness there is no further place<br />\nfor hope.</p>\n\n<p><br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n", "authorId": 1, "subject": "philosophy", "tags": [], "img": "", "summary": "", "lastUpdated": "2022-09-18 07:43:28.729719"}
