{"name":"Collateral Damage - Utilitarianism","id":178,"content":"<div class=\"box1\" style=\"\">Suppose you are a doctor;&nbsp;two patients arrive at your hospital. One of them is a <em>Leader</em> that everyone loves, who has done great for the people, has helped people a lot. His heart is failing and there is no way other than Heart Transplant to save him. Suppose that the other patient is a <em>Janitor</em>. He can be saved with some effort, although he too is in serious condition. A thought comes to your mind (or someone tells you so) that if you save the <em>Leader</em>, you are not only saving&nbsp;him but saving hundreds&nbsp;of people from their destitute, as the leader will certainly work for thousands of people. Would you be willing to take Janitor&#39;s heart and save the <em>Leader</em>?<br />\n<span style=\"color:#009933;\"><em>Would you kill one (or rather allow one to die), in order to save many?</em></span></div>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>You might say, &quot;who thinks like that?&quot;. Well, let&#39;s see. Let&#39;s consider this scenario, your country&#39;s intelligence agency has come to know that a terrorist country is going to attack it and the government is willing to attack that country. <em>Would you approve it knowing that the country has many innocent people who will be killed along with possible terrorists? How do you justify the killing of those innocent people?</em></p>\n\n<p>(You can simply say that even if it wrong, we don&#39;t have any other option keeping in mind that our own survival is more important; <em>but then every criminal can justify their crime, in the same way, e.g. a person who killed a rich man because his family was dying of hunger, and he didn&#39;t know any other means of getting money</em>)</p>\n\n<p>Some people think that the resulting&nbsp;amount of Good matters, even if it comes at some cost of damage, bad thing in small quantity.&nbsp;In simple words, <strong>if something is beneficial for the mass it should be done whatsoever</strong>. This thinking is called <a href=\"https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/utilitarianism-history/\"><em><strong>Utilitarianism</strong></em></a>.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Utilitarianism</strong> -&nbsp; Though there are many varieties of the view discussed, utilitarianism is generally held to be the view that the morally right action is the action that <strong>produces the best</strong>&nbsp;(<em>but, what is the best?</em>).</p>\n\n<p>The Classical Utilitarians, <strong>Jeremy Bentham</strong> and <strong>John Stuart Mill</strong>, identified the good with pleasure, so, like Epicurus, were hedonists about value. They also held that we ought to maximize the good, that is, bring about <strong>&lsquo;the greatest amount of good for the greatest number&rsquo;. </strong>This idea is for all levels: individual, collective. This is hugely employed in modern world in form of Cost-Benefit models by economy, companies and governments.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Prejudice apart, the game of push-pin is of equal value with the arts and sciences of music and poetry. - Bentham</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>People who worked on Utilitarianism (or something similar):</p>\n\n<p>Richard Cumberland (1631&ndash;1718) and John Gay (1699&ndash;1745):&nbsp; They believed that promoting human happiness was incumbent on us since it was approved by God</p>\n\n<p>Shaftesbury (1671&ndash;1713), Francis Hutcheson and David Hume (1711&ndash;1776): moral discrimination</p>\n\n<p>Jeremy Bentham: Hume focussed on Character, not on the actions, Bentham (who was interested in social reforms) focussed more on the actions. Roughly, <u>you are good not because you are Good, you are Good because you do something Good</u>&nbsp;(as the real Character is known only by the person himself). In simple words, <strong><em>&quot;I can never be sure that you are good unless you do something good&quot;</em></strong>.</p>\n\n<p>Hume uses an ideal observer to determine if something is virtue or vice. If the observer receives pleasure from the action/trait, it is virtue else vice. <em>[But what is IDEAL?]</em></p>\n\n<p>Bentham&#39;s idea does not depend on what the observer receives, rather the consequences that the action/trait brings. <strong>How much pleasure/utility (on the whole) does the action bring</strong>.&nbsp;When called upon to make a moral decision one measures an action&#39;s value with respect to pleasure and pain according to the following: intensity (how strong the pleasure or pain is), duration (how long it lasts), certainty (how likely the pleasure or pain is to be the result of the action), proximity (how close the sensation will be to performance of the action), fecundity (how likely it is to lead to further pleasures or pains), purity (how much intermixture there is with the other sensation). One also considers the extent &mdash; the number of people affected by the action.</p>\n\n<p>John Stuart Mill: <q>It is better to be Socrates &lsquo;dissatisfied&rsquo; than a fool &lsquo;satisfied.&rsquo; In this way, Mill was able to solve a problem for utilitarianism.</q> Unlike Bentham, he believed that quality of pleasure matters and that intellectual pleasures are greater than others. His ideas were still also to utilitarianism.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p class=\"quoteText\">It is better to be a human being dissatisfied than a pig satisfied; better to be Socrates dissatisfied than a fool satisfied. And if the fool, or the pig, is of a different opinion, it is only because they only know their own side of the question. - Mill</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>However, even quality can be quantified (or has to be for practical purposes). I<em>ntensity, duration, certainty or uncertainty, propinquity or remoteness, fecundity, purity,</em>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em>extent</em> are the parameters to decide the quality of pleasures.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Henry Sidgwick:&nbsp;Henry Sidgwick&#39;s (1838&ndash;1900)&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Methods_of_Ethics\" target=\"_blank\"><em>The Methods of Ethics</em>&nbsp;</a>(1874) is one of the most well-known works in utilitarian moral philosophy.&nbsp;Egoism, intuition-based morality and utilitarianism are the methods that are implicit in our common moral reasoning.</p>\n\n<h2><a name=\"IdeUti\">Ideal Utilitarianism</a></h2>\n\n<p>G. E. Moore: Good should be promoted but, good is not limited by pleasures (utility). Imagine a world full of sadists and another empty world. Which one is good? The empty one, even though the first one has pleasure. The absence of bad (intentionality) is also necessary.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Imagine a world full of beautiful things which complement each other. Imagine another world with the ugliest things that we detest. Both worlds have no human observers. Which one is Good? Obviously, the first one, even though there is not utility overall. <em>(But as soon as you say Good, it means you are the observer, both of the worlds are neither good nor bad by themselves)</em></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>Examples:</strong></p>\n\n<p>Hypothetical: <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trolley_problem\" target=\"_blank\">Trolley Problem</a></p>\n\n<p>Real Instance:</p>\n\n<ol>\n\t<li><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R_v_Dudley_and_Stephens\" target=\"_blank\">Dudly and Stephens Case</a> - three sailors kill one of their companion (who was an orphan, had no family) to feed themselves out of sheer necessity.</li>\n\t<li><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_Finance_Balance_of_Smoking_in_the_Czech_Republic\" target=\"_blank\">Philip Morris Cost-Benefit Analysis</a> - The cigarette company reports that the benefits of the revenue combined with the cost saved by premature deaths of smokers outweighs the costs incurred e.g. loss of income tax.&nbsp;</li>\n\t<li><a href=\"https://users.wfu.edu/palmitar/Law&amp;Valuation/Papers/1999/Leggett-pinto.html\" target=\"_blank\">Ford Pinto Case</a> - Ford knew that the dangers of installing gas engine in rear side, but based on cost-benefit analysis they decided not fix it.

It doesn&rsquo;t seem like much of an excuse to simply say, oh well,<br />\nif the biker dies, it&rsquo;s not my fault. I didn&rsquo;t do it, I&rsquo;m just allowing it to happen. <em>Would you do so?</em><br />\n&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br />\n&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;(7) George is morally opposed to chemical weapons. But he is considering taking a job making chemical weapons, knowing that if he does not, someone else will, and will probably make the weapons worse than he would.<br />\n&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <em>&nbsp;Should George take the job?</em></p>\n\n<p><br />\n&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;(8) Bridgett is a&nbsp; poor college student who has always wanted her own car.&nbsp;She works after school jobs, saves all her money, rarely&nbsp;goes out, until she has $7000. On her way to the used&nbsp;car dealership, she reads about a&nbsp;Tsunami in SE Asia&nbsp;that has left thousands dead, wounded and homeless.<br />\n&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; (P1) If utilitarianism is true, then it would be morally&nbsp;wrong for Bridgett to buy a car rather than give the money to the relief effort.&nbsp;<br />\n&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br />\n&nbsp; &nbsp; (9) Simon&rsquo;s mother is feeling really lonely and would like Simon to come and&nbsp;spend the day with her. Simon, an engineer, had&nbsp;planned on using the day to volunteer for Habitat for Humanity. By volunteering, since he would be helping a&nbsp;whole family for the rest of their lives, rather than&nbsp;cheering up his mother for simply one day.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; If utilitarianism is true, then it would be morally wrong for Simon to visit his mother rather than volunteer<br />\n&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br />\n&nbsp; &nbsp; - accept that a lot of the time people put their own interests,&nbsp;commitments and relationships first<br />\n&nbsp; &nbsp; - realize that this is inevitable and not try to punish people for&nbsp;this, or try to force everyone to be moral all the time<br />\n&nbsp; &nbsp; - probably enforcing morality or punishing wrongdoers itself&nbsp;would create far more unhappiness than happiness</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;(10) On her deathbed, Susan&rsquo;s mother asked Susan to deliver a fresh bouquet of&nbsp;flowers to her gravesite twice a year. After her death,&nbsp;Susan blows off the request, since it simply wastes time&nbsp;and money on flowers that her mother can no longer enjoy<br />\n&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; If utilitarianism is true, then Susan&rsquo;s act of blowing off her promise to her mother is morally right.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;(11) David and Angelika are recently married people who have promised to be faithful&nbsp;to each other. David is a member of the Navy who has been&nbsp;sent away on a year long mission in a submarine. Angelika&nbsp;misses their physical intimacy, and as a substitute has secret&nbsp;sexual affairs with willing college students who aren&rsquo;t looking&nbsp;for long term relationships. No one else knows about her&nbsp;dalliances, and David never finds out.&nbsp;<br />\n&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; If utilitarianism is true, then Angelika&rsquo;s acts of cheating on her husband are morally right.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;<strong>Do utilitarians have a response to worries about&nbsp;</strong><strong>promises?</strong><br />\n&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; a) Utilitarianism can explain why in most cases we should&nbsp;fulfil&nbsp;promises.<br />\n&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; - it upsets people to break promises; destroys important bonds of trust.<br />\n&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; b) Can accept that when it does more harm to keep a&nbsp;promise than break it, it is morally right to break it.<br />\n&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; - Surely there are cases where promises should be broken.</p>\n\n<p>You can say that in many cases while calculating utility we do not account for effects of our choices e.g. if you yank out healthy person&#39;s organs to save five people, ultimately people will find it out, and it will result in more suffering than happiness (less utility in the long run). But is that the only reason you would not do it?</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h2>Libertarianism</h2>\n\n<p>People&#39;s individual rights are so far-reaching that State should not interfere. As a result of this idea, some cases do not fall under State&#39;s authority e.g.:</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>No Paternalist legislations e.g. wearing seatbelts, forced PF/social security.</li>\n\t<li>Moral legislation e.g. against LGBT</li>\n\t<li>Redistribution from rich to poor e.g. Taxation</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>All these are forms of coercion.</p>\n\n<p>Taxation = Taking away some of my earnings = Govt has power over certain amount of work that I do = Forced labour for some time = Slavery to some extent. This violates the individual right of self-possession.</p>\n\n<p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">People should get what they deserve, not what they need. You can&#39;t force others because someone needs it. Rich people can give the charity if they want to, but forcing them is not justified.</p>\n\n<p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">Taxpayers are in the society by consent. And if taxation is implemented by democracy, how is it wrong?</p>\n\n<p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">Do we even have the right of self-possession if we choose to live in a society? Don&#39;t these rich owe something to the society even they they got what they have as a result of free-exchange in the market?</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.crf-usa.org/foundations-of-our-constitution/natural-rights.html\" target=\"_blank\">Locke&#39;s inalienable rights</a>.</p>\n\n<p>State of nature, Law of Nature -</p>\n\n<p>But state of nature is more chaotic and unstable. And so by consent, people agree to give up the state of nature and form society and government. But what powers does this form of government has? Government cannot take away inalienable rights, because that was the reason for entering into society in the first place. But government can define what counts as property, otherwise it would not be able to function. And in society, your consent becomes the consent of majority.</p>\n\n<p>But then by consenting you are already giving up inalienable rights. Non-arbitrary actions of majority do not violate inalienable rights, because random processes are very consistent with nature. In this view, government can not only tax people on a general basis, but also use military conscription. In Civil War, military conscription was used along with the option to outsource it on your behalf.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n","authorId":null,"subject":"philosophy","tags":null,"img":null,"summary":"The question is \"Is it moral to kill (or rather let die) one in order to save five (many in general)\"?","lastUpdated":"2020-03-27T14:03:10.170+0000"}
