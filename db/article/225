Emil considered (1), (2) and (5) to be ignorabimus.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Hilbert\" target=\"_blank\">David Hilbert</a> opposed the above with slogan</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p><i>Wir m&uuml;ssen wissen &ndash; wir werden wissen.</i> (&#39;We must know - we will know.&#39;)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Hilbert&#39;s sixth problem demands to extend axiomatic nature to Physics (including other fields where mathematics plays a role). But the problem with Physics is that there is not axiomatic ground to combine <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_field_theory\" target=\"_blank\">Quantum Field Theory</a> and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_relativity\" target=\"_blank\">General Relativity Theory</a> i.e. Theory of Everything</p>\n\n<p>Will we ever be able to solve these mysteries? What are the reasons to think that we might and what are the reasons to think that we won&#39;t?</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>That evolution has made us not to be able to solve cognitive tasks, but to survive. There are bound to be &quot;thoughts that we are unequipped to think&quot; (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/dec/06/jerry-fodor-obituary\">Jerry Fodor)</a></p>\n\n<p>Chomsky has said it as well, &quot;Just like evolution constrains us in some physiological capabilities e.g. we can&#39;t fly; there must be constrains on our cognitive capability as well&quot;.</p>\n\n<p>Human brain is closed off for certain cognitive wonders. There must be true solution to problems like Mind-Body, Consciousness etc but human brain cannot access those solutions, cannot understand them. Cognitive Closure <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colin_McGinn\">Colin McGinn</a></p>\n\n<p>In the science fiction series <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2018/feb/27/the-hitchhikers-guide-to-the-galaxy-bbc-radio-4\">The Hitchhiker&#39;s Guide to The Galaxy</a>, an alien civilisation builds a massive supercomputer to calculate the Answer to the Ultimate Question of Life, the Universe and Everything. When the computer finally announces that the answer is &quot;42&quot;, no one has a clue what this means (in fact, they go on to construct an even bigger supercomputer to figure out precisely this).</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>Reasons which go against these pessimistic reasons:</strong></p>\n\n<p>Just because we are not able to even imagine what the solution would be or that these problems are such wonder, it is not reasonable to believe that we will never be able to solve them. Afterall there have been many instances in history when we had mind-boggling discoveries which we could not even imagine. Example the finding that the Earth revolves, the finding that we have evolved from single-cell organisms, theory of relativity.</p>\n\n<p>If our brain are not designed or are cognitively closed to discover mysteries about the world, universe and existence then how come we became able to find about the evolution and many other things unimaginable?</p>\n\n<p>We don&#39;t just rely on brains only for cognition now. Tools like super-computers, models, mathematics have been used to understand many mysteries that our brains cannot make sense of on their own e.g. fourth, fufth dimensions, heliocentrism, energy of waves, black-holes etc.</p>\n\n<p>Collective human cognition along with tools has seen exponential growth so far, so why stop here?</p>\n\n<p>Another hope is the universal presence of patterns. And the emergence of complexity from simple rules. There are abundant examples that suggest that complex systems can arise from simple rules. <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellular_automaton\" target=\"_blank\">Cellular Automata</a>, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fractal\" target=\"_blank\">Fractals</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Mathematical and physical equations are able to describe complex systems behavior. In a given system of understanding that we have mathematical equations can also create a complex system. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34hAZPTzfE0\">See this MIT video</a>. However, there are chaotic systems as well which can&#39;t be fully explained by simple rules, even though simple rules kickstart the system. Also, one more thing to notice is that even though we have simple equations for complex systems, it&#39;s the execution that gets the system to a certain stage and the interaction of the system with whatever is outside the system. The simple equations are just an abstract form of the execution of the system.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h2>Against Logic</h2>\n\n<p><span><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kurt_G%C3%B6del\" target=\"_blank\">Kurt G&ouml;del</a> showed us that in any (mathematical) system there can be statements which are true but cannot be proven to be true. But, then how do we know that those statements are true, if it cannot be proven by logic?? </span><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G%C3%B6del%27s_incompleteness_theorems\" target=\"_blank\">G&ouml;del&#39;s incompleteness theorems</a>. Mathematics was the best language that we had, which was consistent, that we could believe that it would not ever say contradictory things. But Godel showed that it is not so.</p>\n\n<p>How did Godel show this? - Convert every mathematical axiom and logical operations into numbers. Then we can also turn statements into numbers. Now using mathematical operations you can get to the theorem from the axioms. So what if the theorem is this theorem: <em>&quot;This statement cannot be proven&quot;</em>. You will apply mathematical operations and reach to the number corresponding to the given theorem. So, you just proved that this statement cannot be proven. Now if you try to include this theorem as an axiom, we can create another such statement, and it will lead to <em>infinite regression</em>. <em>[But what if we keep on adding the axioms for decidability? We won&#39;t find the objective or the ultimate theory, but do we have objective or ultimate theory for anything?</em>]</p>\n\n<p>And, this is not just about self-referential Godelian statements, mathematicians have then discovered other things within mathematical system that are true but not provable. <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris%E2%80%93Harrington_theorem\" target=\"_blank\">Paris-Harringstone Theorem</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Godel basically showed <strong><em>formally</em></strong> that <em>&quot;anything true is provable.&quot;</em></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>if a wff&nbsp;<strong>A</strong> of a first-order theory<span class=\"math-container\"> <strong>T</strong> is logically implied by the axioms of&nbsp; <strong>T</strong> , then it is provable in <strong>T</strong>, where &quot;<strong>T</strong> logically implies <strong>A</strong>&quot; means that <strong>A</strong> is true in every model of <strong>T</strong>.</span></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>And then showed that the above is not true for logical systems.</p>\n\n<p>Recursively enumerable (i.e., there is a computer program that can list the axioms of <span class=\"math\">T</span></p>\n\n<ol>\n\t<li>Recursively enumerable (i.e., there is a computer program that can list the axioms of <span class=\"math\">T</span>)</li>\n\t<li>Consistent, and</li>\n\t<li>Capable of interpreting some amount of Peano arithmetic (typically, one requires the fragment known as Robinson&#39;s Q),</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>then<span class=\"math\">T</span>is not complete, i.e., there is at least one sentence <span class=\"math\">\\phi</span>in the same language as <span class=\"math\">T</span>such that there is a model of<span class=\"math\">T</span>and<span class=\"math\">\\phi</span>, and there is also a model of<span class=\"math\">T</span>and<span class=\"math\">\\lnot\\phi</span>. Equivalently (by the completeness theorem),<span class=\"math\">T</span>cannot prove<span class=\"math\">\\phi</span>and also<span class=\"math\">T</span>cannot prove <span class=\"math\">\\lnot\\phi</span>.</p>\n\n<p>One usually says this as follows: If a theory is reasonable and at least modestly strong, then it is not complete.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Summary:</strong> <span style=\"color:#330099;\">Even in the language (a cognitive system) as precise as mathematics, many times you only intuitively &quot;know&quot; that something is true but you can&#39;t prove it.</span></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n","authorId":null,"subject":"philosophy","tags":null,"img":null,"summary":"Are there problems which we will never be able to solve?
