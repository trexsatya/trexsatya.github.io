{"name":"Aristotle's Rhetoric","id":168,"content":"<p><strong>&nbsp;A Little About Aristotle: Life:&nbsp;</strong>More than 320 years before Christ. <strong>Taught By</strong> Plato.&nbsp;<strong>Taught&nbsp;</strong><u>Alexander The Great</u>. Is considered The Father of Western Philosophy along with Plato. His works cover a lot of subjects: Physics, Biology, Zoology, Metaphysics, Logic, Ethics, Aesthetics, Poetics, Theatre, Music, Rhetoric, Psychology, Linguistics, Politics, Government.</p>\n\n<p>Established a school called <strong>Lyceum</strong>. Turned himself from Platonism to Empirism. Only a few of his writings have survived. Aristotle was probably the first intellectual who described Empiricism which is foundation of science.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><u><strong>Empiricism</strong></u>: All knowledge comes from experience/sensory-inputs/perception.&nbsp;&quot;knowledge is tentative and probabilistic, subject to continued revision and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falsifiability\" title=\"Falsifiability\">falsification</a>.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p><q>What the mind (<i><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nous\" title=\"Nous\">nous</a></i>) thinks must be in it in the same sense as letters are on a tablet (<i>grammarian</i>) which bears no actual writing (<i>grammenon</i>); this is just what happens in the case of the mind. (Aristotle,&nbsp;<i><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/On_the_Soul\" title=\"On the Soul\">On the Soul</a></i>, 3.4.430<sup>a</sup>1)</q></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>&nbsp;<q>...&#39;Man&#39;, and indeed every general predicate, signifies not an individual, but some quality, or quantity or relation, or something of that sort.

K. Thomson, trans.). New York: Viking. p. 104.</font></q></p>\n\n<p><strong>What is art for?</strong> to make profound truths about life stick in our minds.</p>\n\n<p><strong>What are friends for?</strong> - When each person is seeking fun, which other person provides they are&nbsp;Strategic acquaintances, <strong>True Friend</strong>: Someone who is not just like you but you care about them as you care about yourself. Their sorrows your sorrow, their joy your joy, you are relieved from the too-small orbit of your own thoughts and worries. You expand into the life of another.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>The best argument doesn&#39;t always win the debate or the battle. Why this happens and what can we do about it?&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><u>Rhetoric (<em>the art of getting people to agree with you</em>)&nbsp;</u>book written by Aristotle is one of the most famous from his works.</p>\n\n<h2>Practical Examples and Excerpts from book &quot;Rhetoric&quot;</h2>\n\n<p>You present a Recommendation Letter from an honored person, and the employer is persuaded easily, because of the <i>Ethos</i>, the credibility of the speaker.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><em><strong>ETHOS</strong>:</em>&nbsp;requires reputation, credibility, experience/interest/study in the subject matter.&nbsp;There are three categories of ethos.</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>&nbsp;phronesis - practical skills &amp; wisdom</li>\n\t<li>&nbsp;arete - virtue, goodness</li>\n\t<li>eunoia - goodwill towards the audience</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>PATHOS</strong>: You paint an imaginary future which appeals to the listener, stirs the emotions within the listener. Remember most of the people are driven by passion/emotions rather than logic. Emotional appeal can be accomplished in a multitude of ways:</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>by a metaphor or story telling, common as a hook,</li>\n\t<li>by a general passion in the delivery and an overall emotion and sympathies of the speech or writing as determined by the audience. The pathos of a speech or writing is only ultimately determined by the hearers.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><em><strong>LOGOS</strong>:</em>&nbsp;You propose logical causes and effects and relationships among events. However, it could be misleading.</p>\n\n<h3><strong>HAPPINESS:</strong></h3>\n\n<p lang=\"en-US\">Peoples actions are directed by the desire for happiness. How do you define happiness?</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li lang=\"en-US\">Prosperity combined with virtue;&nbsp;</li>\n\t<li lang=\"en-US\">or the independence of life;</li>\n\t<li lang=\"en-US\">or the secure enjoyment of the maximum of pleasure;&nbsp;</li>\n\t<li lang=\"en-US\">or a good condition of property and body,&nbsp; together with the power of guarding one&rsquo;s property and body and&nbsp;making use of them.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p lang=\"en-US\"><span style=\"color:#8e44ad;\"><em>[But what kind of&nbsp;Virtue? What kind of pleasure? And to what level? - See above for enlisting of virtues with the level]</em></span></p>\n\n<p lang=\"en-US\">These are all abstract terms. What makes happiness?</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li lang=\"en-US\">good birth</li>\n\t<li lang=\"en-US\">plenty of friends, good friends</li>\n\t<li lang=\"en-US\">wealth</li>\n\t<li lang=\"en-US\">good&nbsp;children, plenty of children</li>\n\t<li lang=\"en-US\">a happy old age,</li>\n\t<li lang=\"en-US\">also such bodily excellences&nbsp;as health, beauty, strength, large stature, athletic powers,&nbsp;</li>\n\t<li lang=\"en-US\">together with fame, honor, good luck, and virtue.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p lang=\"en-US\"><strong>Wealth:</strong>&nbsp;plenty of money, territory, the ownership of numerous, large, and beautiful estates;&nbsp;all of these properties should be:</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li lang=\"en-US\">secure - the use of the property is in our power. It is in our own power to use them, keep them or dispose of them.</li>\n\t<li lang=\"en-US\">&nbsp;gentlemanly - enjoyable, that nothing worth mentioning except the use of them.</li>\n\t<li lang=\"en-US\">useful - productive, which bring income to us.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p lang=\"en-US\"><strong>Fame:</strong>&nbsp;being respected by everybody, or having some quality that is desired by all men, or by most, or by the good, or by the wise.</p>\n\n<p lang=\"en-US\"><strong>Honor:</strong>&nbsp;the token of a man&rsquo;s being famous for doing good (either to the preservation of life and the means of life, or to wealth, or to some other of the good things which it is hard to get either always or at that particular place or time).&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p lang=\"en-US\" style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">(many gain honor for things which seem small, but the place and the occasion account for it.)</p>\n\n<p lang=\"en-US\" style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">It is chiefly and most properly paid to those who have already done good; but also to the man who can do good in the future.</p>\n\n<p lang=\"en-US\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The constituents of honor are sacrifices; commemoration, in verse or prose; privileges; grants of land; front seats at civic celebrations; state burial; statues; public maintenance; among foreigners, obeisances and giving place; and such presents as are among various bodies of men regarded as marks of honor.</p>\n\n<p lang=\"en-US\" style=\"margin-left: 40px;\"><span style=\"color:#16a085;\">Present/Gift&nbsp;is something that satisfies both who love money, and those who love honor.</span>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p lang=\"en-US\"><strong>Good luck:</strong> means the acquisition or possession of all or most, or the most important, of those good things which are due to luck.</p>\n\n<p lang=\"en-US\" style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">Some of the things that are due to luck may also be due to artificial contrivance; but many are independent of art, as for example those which are due to nature - though, to be sure, things due to luck may actually be contrary to nature.</p>\n\n<p lang=\"en-US\" style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">Thus health may be due to artificial contrivance, but beauty and stature are due to nature. All such good things as excite envy are, as a class, the outcome of good luck.</p>\n\n<p lang=\"en-US\" style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">Luck is also the cause of good things that happen contrary to reasonable expectation: as when, for instance, all your brothers are ugly, but you are handsome yourself; or when you find a treasure that everybody else has overlooked; or when a missile hits the next man and misses you; or when you are the only man not to go to a place you have gone to regularly, while the others go there for the first time and are killed. All such things are reckoned pieces of good luck.</p>\n\n<p lang=\"en-US\"><em>[Are beauty and stature still due to nature? - What about artificial beauty? Class, Caste,..... are all due to good luck. To what extent can one beat bad luck?]</em></p>\n\n<h3 lang=\"en-US\"><strong>Relative Goodness and Utility:</strong></h3>\n\n<p lang=\"en-US\">Great is &#39;more than normal&#39;.</p>\n\n<p lang=\"en-US\">If some good is accompanied (simultaneously, subsequently, or potentially) by others, then it is greater.</p>\n\n<p lang=\"en-US\">That which is produced by greater good is itself a greater good.</p>\n\n<p lang=\"en-US\">What is wholesome is a greater good than what gives pleasure, thus health is a greater good than pleasure.</p>\n\n<p lang=\"en-US\">A thing which is desirable in itself is a greater good than a thing which is not desirable in itself, as for example bodily strength than what is wholesome, since the latter is not pursued for its own sake, whereas the former is.&nbsp;<strong>One thing can be shown to be more important than the others</strong>:</p>\n\n<p lang=\"en-US\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So Leodamas, when accusing Callistratus, said that <strong>the man who prompted the deed was more guilty than the doer since it would not have been done if he had not planned it</strong>. On the other hand, when accusing Chabrias he said that <strong>the doer was worse than the&nbsp;prompter since there would have been no deed without someone to do it;</strong> men, said he, plot a thing only in order to carry it out.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p lang=\"en-US\"><span style=\"color:#8e44ad;\"><em>[ISN&#39;T THIS WHAT LAWYERS DO? AND PHILOSOPHERS?]</em></span></p>\n\n<p lang=\"en-US\">Further, what is rare is a greater good than what is plentiful. Thus, gold is a better thing than iron, though less useful: it is harder to get, and therefore better worth getting.</p>\n\n<p lang=\"en-US\">Reversely, it may be argued that the plentiful is a better thing than the rare because we can make more use of it. For what is often useful surpasses what is seldom useful, whence the saying: The best of things is water.</p>\n\n<p lang=\"en-US\"><strong>More generally: the hard thing is better than the easy because it is rarer: and reversely, the easy thing is better than the hard, for it is as we wish it to be.</strong></p>\n\n<p lang=\"en-US\">....&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p lang=\"en-US\">Thus, keenness of sight is more desirable than keenness of smell, sight generally being more desirable than smell generally; and similarly, an unusually great love of friends being more honorable than unusually great love of money, ordinary love of friends is more honorable than ordinary love of money.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p lang=\"en-US\">And that is a greater good which would be chosen by a better man, either absolutely, or in virtue of his being better: for instance, to suffer wrong rather than to do wrong, for that would be the choice of the juster man. <span style=\"color:#8e44ad;\"><em>[A JUST MAN WILL RATHER SUFFER THAN CAUSE SUFFER]</em></span></p>\n\n<p lang=\"en-US\">One pleasure is greater than another if it is more unmixed with pain, or more lasting. <span style=\"color:#8e44ad;\"><em>[PLEASURE IN DRINKING VS PLEASURE IN HANGING OUT WITH FRIENDS]</em></span></p>\n\n<p lang=\"en-US\">That, again, which is chosen by all is a greater good than that which is not, and that chosen by the majority than that chosen by the minority. <span style=\"color:#8e44ad;\"><em>[SO, MAJORITY IS ALWAYS RIGHT? BUT, MAJORITY CHANGES WITH TIME!!]</em></span></p>\n\n<p lang=\"en-US\">What is natural is better than what is acquired, since it is harder to come by. Hence the words of Homer: &quot;I have learned from none but myself.&quot; <span style=\"color:#8e44ad;\"><em>[A NATURAL SMILE VS A TRAINED SMILE! A trained smile is Good but a natural smile is better. Also, a trained Smile has potential to become a genuine smile.]</em></span></p>\n\n<p lang=\"en-US\">What aims at reality is better than what aims at the appearance. We may define what aims at appearance as what a man will not choose if nobody is to know of his having it.&nbsp;This would seem to show that to receive benefits is more desirable than to confer them since a man will choose the former even if nobody is to know of it, but it is not the general view that he will choose the latter if nobody knows of it. <span style=\"color:#8e44ad;\"><em>[NOBODY WAS KNOWN TO HAVE IDEA OF RELATIVITY WHEN EINSTEIN THOUGHT IT, WHAT WAS BETTER THEN?]</em></span></p>\n\n<p lang=\"en-US\">...Hence men say that justice is of small value since it is more desirable to seem just than to be just, whereas with health it is not so.</p>\n\n<h3 lang=\"en-US\"><strong>Public Affairs:</strong></h3>\n\n<p lang=\"en-US\">The end (goal) of democracy is freedom; of oligarchy, wealth; of the aristocracy, the maintenance of education and national institutions; of tyranny, the protection of the tyrant.</p>\n\n<h3 lang=\"en-US\"><strong>Virtue:</strong></h3>\n\n<p lang=\"en-US\">If virtue is a faculty of beneficence (as per the general view), the highest kinds of it must be those which are most useful to others, and for this reason, men honor&nbsp;most the just and the courageous, since courage is useful to others in war, justice both in war and in peace.&nbsp;<span style=\"color:#8e44ad;\"><em>[WHAT MAKES IT HIGHEST? - RARITY?]</em></span></p>\n\n<p lang=\"en-US\">Next comes <strong>liberality</strong>; liberal people let their money go instead of fighting for it, whereas other people care more for money than for anything else.</p>\n\n<p lang=\"en-US\"><strong>Justice </strong>is the virtue through which everybody enjoys his own possessions in accordance with the law; its opposite is an injustice, through which men enjoy the possessions of others in defiance of the law. <span style=\"color:#8e44ad;\"><em>[ IS INCOME TAX JUST?]</em></span></p>\n\n<p lang=\"en-US\"><strong>Courage </strong>is the virtue that disposes men to do noble deeds in situations of danger, in accordance with the law and in obedience to its commands; cowardice is the opposite.</p>\n\n<p lang=\"en-US\"><strong>Temperance</strong> is the virtue that disposes us to obey the law (special &amp; general) where physical pleasures are concerned; incontinence is the opposite. <span style=\"color:#8e44ad;\"><em>[BUT LAWS CHANGE]</em></span></p>\n\n<p lang=\"en-US\"><strong>Liberality </strong>disposes us to spend money for others&rsquo; good; illiberality is the opposite.</p>\n\n<p lang=\"en-US\"><strong>Magnanimity </strong>is the virtue that disposes us to do good to others on a large scale; (its opposite is meanness of spirit)</p>\n\n<p lang=\"en-US\"><strong>Magnificence </strong>is a virtue productive of greatness in matters involving the spending of money. The opposites of these two are smallness of spirit and meanness respectively.</p>\n\n<p lang=\"en-US\"><strong>Prudence</strong> is that virtue of the understanding which enables men to come to wise decisions about the relation to the happiness of the goods and evils that have been previously mentioned.</p>\n\n<p lang=\"en-US\">Noble also are those actions whose advantage may be enjoyed after death, as opposed to those whose advantage is enjoyed during one&rsquo;s lifetime: for the latter are more likely to be for one&rsquo;s own sake only. <span style=\"color:#8e44ad;\"><em>[HOW IS IT REASONABLE TO CARE FOR OTHERS OVER ONESELF?]</em></span></p>\n\n<p lang=\"en-US\">Since we praise a man for what he has actually done, and fine actions are distinguished from others by being intentionally good, we must try to prove that our hero&rsquo;s noble acts are intentional. This is all the easier if we can make out that he has often acted so before, and therefore we must assert coincidences and accidents to have been intended. Produce a number of good actions, all of the same kind, and people will think that they must have been intended and that they prove the good qualities of the man who did them. <span style=\"color:#8e44ad;\"><em>[WE THINK ABOUT THE INTENTION OF A MAN BASED ON HIS IMAGE]</em></span><span style=\"color:#8e44ad;\"><em> </em></span></p>\n\n<h3 lang=\"en-US\"><strong>Praise</strong></h3>\n\n<p lang=\"en-US\">Praise is the expression in words of the eminence of a man&rsquo;s good qualities, and therefore we must display his actions as the product of such qualities. Encomium refers to what he has actually done; the mention of accessories, such as good birth and&nbsp;education, merely helps to make our story credible-good fathers are likely to have good sons, and good training is likely to produce good character.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p lang=\"en-US\">Even if a man has&nbsp;not actually done a given good thing, we shall bestow praise on him, if we are sure that he is the sort of man who would do it.&nbsp;To praise a man is in one respect akin to urging a course of action.</p>\n\n<p lang=\"en-US\">Suggestion <strong>\uD83E\uDC02</strong>&nbsp;Praise&nbsp; &rsquo;A man should be proud not of what he owes to fortune but of what he owes to himself&rsquo;. if put like&nbsp;this, amounts to a suggestion; to make it into praise we must put it thus, &rsquo;Since he is proud not of what he owes to fortune but of what he owes to himself.&rsquo; <span style=\"color:#8e44ad;\"> </span><span style=\"color:#8e44ad;\"><em>[Way of effective speaking, more fruitful!]</em></span></p>\n\n<p lang=\"en-US\">There are, also, many useful ways of heightening the effect of praise. We must, for instance, point out that a man is the only one, or the first, or almost the only one who has done something, or that he has done it better than anyone else; all these <strong>distinctions are honorable</strong>. If a man has often achieved the same success, we must mention this; that is a strong point; he himself, and not luck, will then be given the credit.</p>\n\n<p lang=\"en-US\">Again, if you cannot find enough to say of a man himself, you may pit him against others who are famous/great.&nbsp;If you cannot compare your hero with famous men, you should at least compare him with other people generally,<br />\nsince any superiority is held to reveal excellence.</p>\n\n<h3 lang=\"en-US\"><strong>Accusation and Defence:</strong><strong> </strong></h3>\n\n<p lang=\"en-US\">Definition of Wrong-Doing:</p>\n\n<p lang=\"en-US\">Wrong-doing is injury voluntarily inflicted contrary to law. &rsquo;Law&rsquo; is either special or general. By special&nbsp;law I mean that written law which regulates the life of a particular community; by general law, all those unwritten principles which<br />\nare supposed to be acknowledged everywhere.&nbsp;We do things &rsquo;voluntarily&rsquo; when we do them consciously and without constraint. (Not all voluntary acts are deliberate, but all deliberate acts are<br />\nconscious-no one is ignorant of what he deliberately intends.) The causes of our deliberately intending harmful and wicked acts contrary to law are (1) vice, (2) lack of self-control.</p>\n\n<h3 lang=\"en-US\"><strong>Why does someone do wrong (Motivations)?</strong></h3>\n\n<p lang=\"en-US\">Thus it is the mean man who will wrong others about money, the profligate in matters of physical&nbsp;pleasure, the effeminate in matters of comfort, and the coward where danger is concerned-his terror makes him abandon those<br />\nwho are involved in the same danger.&nbsp;The ambitious man does wrong for sake of honour, the quick-tempered from anger, the lover of victory for the sake of victory, the embittered man for the sake of revenge, the stupid man because he has misguided notions of right and wrong, the shameless man because he does not mind what people think of him; and so with the rest - <strong>any wrong that anyone does to others corresponds to his particular faults of character</strong>.</p>\n\n<p lang=\"en-US\">We have now to consider the motives and states of mind of wrongdoers, and to whom they do wrong.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p lang=\"en-US\">... Thus every action must be due to one or other of seven causes: chance, nature, compulsion, habit, reasoning, anger, or appetite. Although these cover all, we must know what kinds of actions and people usually go together; while there are no definite kinds of action associated with the fact that a man is fair or dark, tall or short, it does make a difference if he is young or old, just or unjust.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p lang=\"en-US\">The things that happen <strong>by chance</strong> are all those whose cause cannot be determined, that have no purpose, and that happen neither always nor usually nor in any fixed way. The definition of chance shows just what they are.</p>\n\n<p lang=\"en-US\">Those things happen <strong>by nature</strong> which have a fixed and internal cause; they take place uniformly, either always or usually.&nbsp;There is no need to discuss in exact detail the things that happen contrary to nature, nor to ask whether they happen in some sense naturally or from some other cause; it would seem that chance is at least partly the cause of such events.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p lang=\"en-US\">Those things happen <strong>through compulsion</strong> which take&nbsp;place contrary to the desire or reason of the doer, yet through his own agency.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p lang=\"en-US\">Acts are done <strong>from </strong><strong>habit</strong> which men do because they have often done them before.</p>\n\n<p lang=\"en-US\">Actions are <strong>due to reasoning</strong> when, in view of any of the goods already mentioned, they appear useful either as ends or as means to an end, and are performed for that reason: &rsquo;for that reason,&rsquo; since even licentious persons perform a certain number of useful actions, but because they are pleasant and not because they are useful.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p lang=\"en-US\">To passion and <strong>anger</strong> are due all acts of revenge. Revenge and punishment are different things. Punishment is inflicted for the sake of the person punished; revenge for that of the punisher, to satisfy his feelings.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p lang=\"en-US\"><strong>Appetite</strong> is the cause of all actions that appear pleasant. Habit, whether acquired by mere familiarity or by effort, belongs to the class of pleasant things, for there are many actions not naturally pleasant which men perform with pleasure, once they have become used to them.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"pleasure\" lang=\"en-US\"><strong>Pleasure</strong></h3>\n\n<p lang=\"en-US\">Definition of Pleasure:</p>\n\n<p lang=\"en-US\">Pleasure is a movement, a movement by which the soul as a whole is consciously brought into its normal state of being; and that Pain is the opposite.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p lang=\"en-US\"><strong>Habits</strong> also are pleasant; for as soon as a thing has become habitual, it is <strong>virtually natural</strong>; habit is a thing not unlike nature; what happens often is akin to what happens always, natural events happening always, habitual events often.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p lang=\"en-US\">Again, that is pleasant which is not forced on us; for force is unnatural, and that is why what is compulsory, painful, and it has been rightly said</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p lang=\"en-US\"><cite><q>All that is done on compulsion is bitterness unto the soul.</q></cite></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p lang=\"en-US\">So all acts of concentration, strong effort, and strain are necessarily painful; they all involve compulsion and force unless we are accustomed to them, in which case it is custom that makes them pleasant.&nbsp;The opposites to these are pleasant; and hence ease, freedom from toil, relaxation, amusement, rest, and sleep belong to the class of pleasant things; for these are all free from any element of compulsion.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p lang=\"en-US\">Everything, too, is pleasant for which are <strong>desirous</strong>, since desire is the craving for pleasure.&nbsp;Of the desires some are irrational, some associated with reason.</p>\n\n<p lang=\"en-US\">By <strong>irrational desires</strong> I mean those which do not arise from any opinion held by the mind. Of this kind are those known as &rsquo;natural&rsquo;; for instance, those originating in the body, such as the desire for nourishment, namely hunger and thirst, and a separate kind of desire answering to each kind of nourishment; and the desires connected with taste and sex and sensations of touch in general;&nbsp;and those of smell, hearing, and vision. <span style=\"color:#8e44ad;\"><i>[UNCONSCIOUS/ SUBCONSCIOUS]</i></span></p>\n\n<p lang=\"en-US\"><strong>Rational desires</strong> are those which we are induced to have; there are many things we desire to see or get because we have been told of them and induced to&nbsp;believe them good.</p>\n\n<p lang=\"en-US\">Further, <u>pleasure is the consciousness through the senses of a certain kind of emotion</u>; but imagination is a feeble sort of sensation, and there will always be in the mind of a man who remembers or expects something an image or picture of what he remembers or expects. If this is so, it is clear that memory and expectation also, being accompanied by sensation, may be accompanied by pleasure. It follows that anything pleasant is either <u>present and </u><u>perceived</u>, past and remembered, or future and expected. Now the things that are pleasant to remember are not only those that, when actually perceived as present, were pleasant but also some things that were not, provided that their results have subsequently proved noble and good. <span style=\"color:#8e44ad;\"><em>[THIS IS WHY WE LIVE IN PAST AND FUTURE, MORE THAN PRESENT!]</em></span></p>\n\n<p lang=\"en-US\">Hence the words</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p lang=\"en-US\">Sweet &rsquo;tis when rescued to remember pain,<br />\nand Even his griefs are a joy long after to one that remembers<br />\nAll that he wrought and endured.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p lang=\"en-US\">The reason for this is that it is pleasant even to be merely free from evil.&nbsp;The things it is pleasant to expect are those that when present are felt to afford us either great delight or great but not painful benefit. And in general, all the things that delight us when they are present also do so, as a rule, when we merely remember or expect them.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p lang=\"en-US\">Some pleasant feeling is <strong>associated with</strong> most of our <strong>appetites </strong>we are enjoying either the memory of a past pleasure or the expectation of a future one, just as persons down with fever, during their attacks of thirst, enjoy remembering the drinks they have had and looking forward to having more.&nbsp;So also a lover enjoys talking or writing about his loved one, or doing any little thing connected&nbsp;with him; all these things recall him to memory and make him actually present to the eye of <strong>imagination</strong>. Indeed, it is always the first sign of love, that besides enjoying some one&rsquo;s presence, we remember him when he is gone, and feel pain as well as pleasure, because he is there no longer.</p>\n\n<p lang=\"en-US\">Similarly, there is an element of pleasure even in mourning and lamentation for the departed.&nbsp;There is grief, indeed, at his loss, but pleasure in remembering him and as it were seeing him before us in his deeds and in his life.</p>\n\n<p lang=\"en-US\">We can well believe the poet when he says</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p lang=\"en-US\">He spake, and in each man&rsquo;s heart, he awakened the love of lament.&nbsp;</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p lang=\"en-US\">Revenge, too, is pleasant; it is pleasant to get anything that it is painful to fail to get, and angry people suffer extreme pain when they fail to get their revenge; but they enjoy the prospect of getting it.</p>\n\n<p lang=\"en-US\">The <strong>victory </strong>also <strong>is pleasant</strong>, and not merely to &rsquo;bad losers&rsquo;, but to everyone; the winner sees himself in the light of a champion, and everybody has a more or less keen appetite for being that. The pleasantness of victory implies of course that combative sports and intellectual contests are pleasant (since in these it often happens that someone wins) and also games like knuckle-bones, ball, dice, and draughts. And similarly with the serious sports; some of these become pleasant <strong>when </strong>one is <strong>accustomed </strong>to them; while others are pleasant from the first, like hunting with hounds, or indeed any kind of hunting. For <strong>where there is competition, there is </strong><strong>victory</strong>.&nbsp; That is why forensic pleading and debating contests are pleasant to those who are accustomed to them and have the capacity for them.</p>\n\n<p lang=\"en-US\"><strong>Honour and good</strong> repute are among the most pleasant things of all; they make a man see himself in the character of a fine fellow, especially when he is credited with it by people whom he thinks good judges. His neighbors are better judges than people at a distance; his associates and fellow countrymen better than strangers; his contemporaries better than posterity; sensible persons better than foolish ones; a large number of people better than a small number: those of the former class, in each case, are the more likely to be good judges of him. <span style=\"color:#8e44ad;\"><em>[IN THE AGE OF INTERNET, STRANGERS CAN BE MORE NEIGHBORS THAN NEIGHBORS]</em></span></p>\n\n<p lang=\"en-US\">Honor and credit bestowed by those whom you think much inferior to yourself - e.g. children or animals-you do not value: not for its own sake, anyhow: if you do value it, it is for some other reason. <span style=\"color:#8e44ad;\"><em>[A BITTER TRUTH!]</em></span></p>\n\n<p lang=\"en-US\">Friends belong to the class of pleasant things; it is pleasant to love - if you love wine, you certainly find it delightful: and <strong>it is pleasant to be loved</strong>, for this too makes a man see himself as the possessor of goodness, a thing that every being that has a feeling for it desires to possess: to be loved means to be valued for one&rsquo;s own personal qualities. <strong>To be admired is also pleasant</strong>, simply because of the honour implied.</p>\n\n<p lang=\"en-US\"><strong>Flattery</strong> and flatterers are pleasant: a flatterer is a man who, you believe, admires and likes.</p>\n\n<p lang=\"en-US\">To do the same thing often is pleasant (<strong>repetition</strong>), since, as we saw, anything habitual <strong>is pleasant</strong>. And to <strong>change is</strong> also <strong>pleasant</strong>: change means an approach to nature, whereas invariable repetition of anything causes the excessive prolongation of a settled condition: therefore, says the poet,</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p lang=\"en-US\">Change is in all things sweet.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p lang=\"en-US\">That is why what comes to us only at long intervals is pleasant, whether it be a person or a thing; for it is a change from what we had before, and, besides, what comes only at long intervals has the <strong>value of rarity</strong>.</p>\n\n<p lang=\"en-US\"><strong>Learning </strong>things <strong>and wondering</strong> at things <strong>are</strong> also <strong>pleasant</strong> as a rule; wondering implies the desire of learning, so that the object of wonder is an object of desire; while in learning one is brought into one&rsquo;s natural condition.</p>\n\n<p lang=\"en-US\"><strong>Conferring and receiving benefits</strong> belong to the class of <strong>pleasant </strong>things; to receive a benefit is to get what one desires; to confer a benefit implies both possession and superiority, both of which are things we try to attain. It is because beneficent acts are pleasant that people find it pleasant to put their neighbors straight again and to supply what they lack. Again, since learning and wondering are pleasant, it follows that such things as <strong>acts of imitation must be</strong><strong>pleasant&nbsp;</strong>- for instance, painting, sculpture, poetry and every product of skillful imitation; this latter, <em>even if the object imitated is not itself pleasant</em>; for it is not the object itself which here gives delight; the spectator draws inferences (&rsquo;That is a so-and-so&rsquo;) and thus learns&nbsp;something fresh.</p>\n\n<p lang=\"en-US\">Dramatic turns of fortune and hairbreadth escapes from perils are pleasant, because we feel all such things are wonderful.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p lang=\"en-US\">And since what is natural is pleasant, and things akin to each other seem natural to each other, therefore <strong>all kindred and similar things are usually pleasant to each other</strong>; for instance, one man, horse, or young person is pleasant to another man, horse, or young person. Hence the proverbs &rsquo;mate delights mate&rsquo;, &rsquo;like to like&rsquo;, &rsquo;<strong>beast knows beast</strong>&rsquo;, &rsquo;jackdaw to jackdaw&rsquo;, and the rest of them. But since everything like and akin to oneself is pleasant, and since every man is himself more like and akin to himself than anyone else is, it <em>follows that all of us must be more or less fond of ourselves</em>. For all this resemblance and kinship is present particularly in the relation of an individual to himself. And because we are all fond of ourselves, it follows that what is our own is pleasant to all of us, as for instance our own deeds and words. That is why we are usually fond of our flatterers, [our lovers,] and honour; also of our children, for our children are our own work. <span style=\"color:#8e44ad;\"><em>[THAT&#39;S WHY I HAD NOT FELT PLEASANT </em></span><em><span style=\"color:#8e44ad;\">MUCH,</span></em><span style=\"color:#8e44ad;\"><em> SINCE I WAS NOT PARTICULARLY FOND OF MYSELF!]</em></span></p>\n\n<p lang=\"en-US\">It is also pleasant to <strong>complete what is defective</strong>, for the whole thing thereupon becomes our own work. <span style=\"color:#8e44ad;\"><em>[FIXING BROKEN THINGS]</em></span></p>\n\n<p lang=\"en-US\">And since power over others is very pleasant, it is <strong>pleasant to be thought wise</strong>, for practical wisdom secures us power over others. (Scientific wisdom is also pleasant, because it is the knowledge of many wonderful things.)</p>\n\n<p lang=\"en-US\">Again, since most of us are ambitious, it must be pleasant to disparage our neighbours as well as to have power over them.</p>\n\n<p lang=\"en-US\">It is pleasant for a man to spend his time over what he feels he can do best; just as the poet says,</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p lang=\"en-US\">To that he bends himself,<br />\nTo that each day allots most time,<br />\nwherein He is indeed the best part of himself.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p lang=\"en-US\">Similarly, since amusement and every kind of <strong>relaxation and laughter</strong> too belong to the class of <strong>pleasant </strong>things, it follows that ludicrous things are pleasant, whether men, words, or deeds.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h3 lang=\"en-US\"><strong>State of Mind of Wrong-Doer</strong></h3>\n\n<p lang=\"en-US\">They must themselves suppose that the thing can be done, and done by them: either that they can do it without being found out, or that if they are found out they can escape being punished, or that if they are punished the disadvantage will be less than the gain for themselves or those they care for.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p lang=\"en-US\">People think that they can themselves most easily do wrong to others without being punished for it if they possess eloquence, or practical ability, or much legal experience, or a large body of friends, or a great deal of money.</p>\n\n<p lang=\"en-US\">Their confidence is greatest if they personally possess the advantages mentioned: but even without them they are satisfied if they have friends or supporters or partners who do possess them:&nbsp;they can thus both commit their crimes and escape being found out and punished for committing them.</p>\n\n<p lang=\"en-US\">They are also safe, they think, if they are on good terms with their victims or with the judges who try them.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p lang=\"en-US\">They are not likely to be found out if their appearance contradicts the charges that might be brought against them: for instance, a weakling is unlikely to be charged with violent assault, or a poor and ugly man with adultery.</p>\n\n<p lang=\"en-US\">Public and open injuries are the easiest to do, because nobody could at all suppose them possible, and therefore no precautions are taken. <span style=\"color:#8e44ad;\"><em>[THAT&#39;S WHY WE HAVE NOW SECURITY SERVICES, INTELLIGENCE SERVICES]</em></span></p>\n\n<p lang=\"en-US\">The same is true of crimes so great and terrible that no man living&nbsp;could be suspected of them: here too no precautions are taken. For all men guard against ordinary offences, just as they guard against ordinary diseases; but no one takes precautions against a disease that nobody has ever had. <span style=\"color:#8e44ad;\"><em>[BUT NOWADAYS WE HAVE ALL KIND OF THINKERS, WHO TRY TO IMAGINE ALL KINDS OF PROBLEMS THAT CAN OCCUR, AND NOWADAYS THINKERS ARE MORE VISIBLE]</em></span></p>\n\n<p lang=\"en-US\">You feel safe, too, if you have either no enemies or a great many; if you have none, you expect not to be watched and therefore not to be detected; if you have a great many, you will be watched, and therefore people will think you can never risk an attempt on them, and you can defend your innocence by pointing out that you could never have taken such a risk. <span style=\"color:#8e44ad;\"><em>[AGAIN, AN EXAMPLE WHERE OPPOSITES ARE AS TRUE]</em></span></p>\n\n<p lang=\"en-US\">You may also trust to hide your crime by the way you do it or the place you do it in, or by some convenient means of disposal.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p lang=\"en-US\">You may feel that even if you are found out you can stave off a trial, or have it postponed, or corrupt your judges: or that even if you are sentenced you can avoid paying damages, or can at least postpone doing so for a long time: or that you are so badly off that you will have nothing to lose.</p>\n\n<p lang=\"en-US\">You may feel that the gain to be got by wrong-doing is great or certain or immediate, and that the penalty is small or uncertain or distant. It may be that the advantage to be gained is greater than any possible retribution: as in the case of despotic power, according to the popular view.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p lang=\"en-US\">Or the opposite argument may appeal to you: your crimes may bring you some credit (thus you may, incidentally, be avenging your father or mother, like Zeno), whereas the punishment may amount to a fine, or banishment, or something of that sort.</p>\n\n<p lang=\"en-US\">People may be led on to wrong others by either of these motives or feelings; but no man by both-they will affect people of quite opposite characters.</p>\n\n<p lang=\"en-US\">You may be encouraged by having often escaped detection or punishment already; or by having often tried and failed; for in crime, as in war, there are men who will always refuse to give up the struggle.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p lang=\"en-US\">You may get your pleasure on the spot and the pain later, or the gain on the spot and the loss later. That is what appeals to weak-willed persons&ndash;and weakness of will may be shown with regard to all the objects of desire.</p>\n\n<p lang=\"en-US\">You may feel able to make it appear that your crime was due to chance, or to necessity, or to natural causes, or to habit: in fact, to put it generally, as if you had failed to do right rather than actually done wrong.</p>\n\n<p lang=\"en-US\">You may be stimulated by being in want: which may mean that you want necessaries, as poor people do, or that you want luxuries, as rich people do.</p>\n\n<p lang=\"en-US\">You may be encouraged by having a particularly good reputation, because that will save you from being suspected: or by having a particularly bad one, because nothing you are likely to do will make it worse.</p>\n\n<h3 lang=\"en-US\"><strong>Just And Unjust Actions</strong></h3>\n\n<p lang=\"en-US\">...From this point of view (recognizing that there are two laws universal and specific), we can perform just or unjust acts in either of two ways-towards one definite person, or towards the community. The man who is guilty of adultery or assault is doing wrong to some definite person; the man who avoids service in the army is doing wrong to the community.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p lang=\"en-US\">In order to be wronged, a man must (1) suffer actual harm, (2) suffer it against his will.</p>\n\n<p lang=\"en-US\">A blow does not always amount to &rsquo;outrage&rsquo;, but only if it is struck with some such purpose as to insult the man struck or gratify the striker himself. Nor does taking a thing without the owner&rsquo;s knowledge always amount to &rsquo;theft&rsquo;, but only if it is taken with the intention of keeping it and injuring the owner.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p lang=\"en-US\">About the wrong-doings in regard to unwritten laws, there are two types:&nbsp;</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li lang=\"en-US\">First, there is the conduct that springs from exceptional goodness or badness, and is visited accordingly with censure and loss of honor, or with praise and increase of honor and decorations: for instance, gratitude to, or requital of, our benefactors, readiness to help our friends, and the like.&nbsp;</li>\n\t<li lang=\"en-US\">The second kind makes up for the defects of a community&rsquo;s written code of law. This is what we call equity; people regard it as just; it is, in fact, the sort of justice which goes beyond the written law.&nbsp;Its existence partly is&nbsp;and partly is not intended by legislators; not intended, where they have noticed no defect in the law; intended, where find themselves unable to define things exactly, and are obliged to legislate as if that held good always which in fact only holds good usually; or where it is not easy to be complete owing to the endless possible cases presented, such as the kinds and sizes of weapons that may be used to inflict wounds - a lifetime would be too short to make out a complete list of these.&nbsp;</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>Equity </strong>must be applied to forgivable actions; and it must make us distinguish between criminal acts on the one hand, and errors of judgement, or misfortunes, on the other. (A &rsquo;misfortune&rsquo; is an act, not due to moral badness, that has unexpected results: an &rsquo;error of judgement&rsquo; is an act, also not due to moral badness, that has results that might have been expected: a &rsquo;criminal act&rsquo; has results that might have been expected, but is due to moral badness, for that is the source of all actions inspired by our appetites.)&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Equity bids us <strong>be merciful to the weakness of human nature</strong>; to think less about the laws than about the man who framed them, and less about what he said than about what he meant; not to consider the actions of the accused so much as his intentions, nor this or that detail so much as the whole story; to ask not what a man is now but what he has always or usually been.&nbsp;It bids us remember benefits rather than injuries, and benefits received rather than benefits conferred; to be patient when we are wronged; to settle a dispute by negotiation and not by force; to prefer arbitration to motion - for an arbitrator goes by the equity of a case, a judge by the strict law, and arbitration was invented with the express purpose of securing full power for equity.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h2><strong><u>Emotions - Anger</u></strong></h2>\n\n<p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">To arouse an emotion, we need to understand 3 things. For example, if X is angry:</p>\n\n<ol>\n\t<li style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">&nbsp; What the state of the mind of X is?</li>\n\t<li style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">&nbsp;Who the people are with whom X usually gets angry with?</li>\n\t<li style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">&nbsp;On what grounds X gets angry with these people?</li>\n</ol>\n\n<div style=\"background: #f5f6fa;\n    border: 1px solid #cccccc;\n    padding: 5px 10px;\n    box-shadow: -2px 0px 4px 0px skyblue;\">\n<p>It has been well said about wrath,</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>Sweeter it is by far than the honeycomb dripping with sweetness. And spreads through the hearts of men</em>.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>&nbsp;It is also attended by a certain pleasure because the thoughts dwell upon the act of vengeance, and the images then called up cause pleasure, like the images called up in dreams.</p>\n\n<p>There are three kinds of SLIGHTING - contempt, spite, and insolence.&nbsp;<br />\n(1) Contempt: you feel contempt for what you consider unimportant, and it is just such things that you slight.&nbsp;<br />\n<br />\n(2) <em>Spite</em>: it is a thwarting another man&rsquo;s wishes, not to get something yourself but to prevent his getting it. The slight arises just from the fact that you do not aim at something for yourself;&nbsp; clearly, you do not think that he can do you harm, for then you would be afraid of him instead of slighting him,&nbsp;&nbsp;nor yet that he can do you any good worth mentioning, for then you would be anxious to make friends with him.&nbsp;<br />\n<br />\n(3) <em>Insolence:</em>&nbsp;since it consists in doing and saying things that cause shame to the victim, not in order that anything may happen to yourself, or because anything has happened to yourself, but simply for the pleasure involved (Retaliation is not &rsquo;insolence&rsquo;, but vengeance)&nbsp;<br />\n<br />\nThat is why youths and rich men are insolent; they think themselves superior when they show insolence.</p>\n</div>\n\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;So Achilles says in anger:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">He hath taken my prize for himself<br />\nand hath done me dishonour,<br />\nand Like an alien honoured by none,</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>meaning that this is why he is angry. A man expects to be specially respected by his inferiors in birth, in capacity, in goodness, and generally in anything in which he is much their superior: as where money is concerned a wealthy man looks for respect from a poor man; where speaking is concerned, the man with a turn for oratory looks for respect from one who cannot speak; the ruler demands the respect of the ruled, and the man who thinks he ought to be a ruler demands the respect of the man whom he thinks he ought to be ruling. Hence it has been said</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">Great is the wrath of kings, whose father is Zeus almighty,<br />\nand Yea, but his rancour abideth long afterward also</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">their great resentment being due to their great superiority. <span style=\"color:#8e44ad;\"><em>[SENSE OF SUPERIORITY]</em></span></p>\n\n<p>Then again a man looks for respect from those who he thinks to owe him good treatment, and these are the people whom he has treated or is treating well, or means or has meant to treat well, either himself, or through his friends, or through others at his request <span style=\"color:#8e44ad;\"><em>[NO RECIPROCATION]</em></span></p>\n\n<p>Thus a sick man is angered by disregard of his illness, a poor man by disregard of his poverty, a man waging war by disregard of the war he is waging, a lover by disregard of his love, and so throughout, any other sort of slight being enough if special slights are wanting. <span style=\"color:#8e44ad;\"><em>[DISREGARD OF CONDITION]</em></span></p>\n\n<p>The persons with whom we get angry are those who laugh, mock, or jeer at us, for such conduct is insolent. <span style=\"color:#8e44ad;\"><em>[INSOLENCE]</em></span></p>\n\n<p>Thus those who are eager to win fame as philosophers get angry with those who show contempt for their philosophy; those who pride themselves upon their appearance get angry with those who show contempt for their appearance and so on in other cases. <span style=\"color:#8e44ad;\"><em>[CONTEMPT]</em></span></p>\n\n<p>Again we are angry with those who rejoice at our misfortunes or simply keep cheerful in the midst of our misfortunes since this shows that they either hate us or are slighting us. <span style=\"color:#8e44ad;\"><em>[SPITE]</em></span></p>\n\n<p>Also with those who are indifferent to the pain they give us: this is why we get angry with bringers of bad news. And with those who listen to stories about us or keep on looking at our weaknesses; this seems like either slighting us or hating us; for those who love us share in all our distresses and it must distress anyone to keep on looking at his own weaknesses. <span style=\"color:#8e44ad;\"><em>[DISREGARD OF EMOTIONS]</em></span></p>\n\n<p>(1) our rivals, (2) those whom we admire, (3) those whom we wish to admire us, (4) those for whom we feel reverence, (5) those who feel reverence for us: if anyone slights us before such persons, we feel particularly angry. Again, we feel angry with those who slight us in connection with what we are as honorable men bound to champion-our parents, children, wives, or subjects. <span style=\"color:#8e44ad;\"><em>[DISREGARD OF GOOD IMAGE]</em></span></p>\n\n<h2><strong>Emotions - Calmness</strong></h2>\n\n<p>Growing Calm means quietening the anger. Slighting which is a voluntary act grows anger. So, we feel calm towards those who did something involuntarily, and those who treat themselves as they have treated us since no one would slight themselves. <span style=\"color:#8e44ad;\"><em>[WHEN SOMEONE PUNISHES / EMBARASSES THEMSELVES TO CALM DOWN OTHER]</em></span></p>\n\n<p>Also towards those who admit their fault and are sorry. <em>[THOSE WHO SAY THAT THEY DESERVE THE PUNISHMENT]</em></p>\n\n<p>That our anger ceases towards those who humble themselves before us is shown even by dogs, who do not bite people when they sit down.</p>\n\n<p>We also feel calm towards those who are serious when we are serious, because then we feel that we are treated seriously and not contemptuously.</p>\n\n<p>Also towards those who have done us more kindnesses than we have done them.</p>\n\n<p>In general, the things that make us calm may be inferred by seeing what the opposites are of those that make us angry.</p>\n\n<p><em>Frame Of Mind That Makes Calm:-</em></p>\n\n<p>when they are amusing themselves or laughing or feasting; when they are feeling prosperous or successful or satisfied; when, in fine, they are enjoying freedom from pain, or inoffensive pleasure, or justifiable hope.</p>\n\n<p>Also when time has passed and their anger is no longer fresh, for time puts an end to anger. <em>[TIME HEALS EVERYTHING]</em></p>\n\n<p>And vengeance previously taken on one person puts an end to even greater anger felt against another person.&nbsp;For men become calm when they have spent their anger on somebody else.</p>\n\n<p>Again, men become calm if they have convicted the offender; or if he has already suffered worse things than they in their anger would have themselves inflicted upon him; for they feel as if they were already avenged.</p>\n\n<p>Or if they feel that they themselves are in the wrong and are suffering justly (for anger is not excited by what is just), since men no longer think then that they are suffering without justification; and anger, as we have seen, means this.</p>\n\n<p>We do not get angry with anyone&nbsp;who cannot be aware of our anger, and in particular we cease to be angry with people once they are dead, for we feel that the worst has been done to them, and that they will neither feel pain nor anything else that we in our anger aim at making them feel.</p>\n\n<h2><strong>Friends and Enemies</strong></h2>\n\n<p>Your&nbsp;friend is the sort of man who shares your pleasure in what is good and your pain in what is unpleasant, for your sake and for no other reason.&nbsp;This pleasure and&nbsp;pain of his will be the token of his good wishes for you, since we all feel glad at getting what we wish for, and pained at getting what we do not.&nbsp;Those, then, are friends to whom the same things are good and evil; and those who are, moreover, friendly or unfriendly to the same people; for in that case they must have the same wishes, and thus by wishing for each other what they wish for themselves, they show themselves each other&rsquo;s friends.</p>\n\n<p>Again, we feel friendly to those who have treated us well, either ourselves or those we care for, whether on a large scale, or readily, or at some particular crisis; provided it was for our own sake.</p>\n\n<p>And also to those who we think wish to treat us well.</p>\n\n<p>And also to our friends&rsquo; friends, and to those who like, or are liked by, those whom we like ourselves.</p>\n\n<p>And also to those who are enemies to those whose enemies we are, and dislike, or are disliked by, those whom we dislike.</p>\n\n<p>And also to those who are willing to treat us well where money or our personal safety is concerned: and therefore we value those who are liberal, brave, or just.</p>\n\n<p>We also like temperate men, because they are not unjust to others; and, for the same reason, those who mind their own business.</p>\n\n<p>And also those whose friends we wish to be, if it is plain that they wish to be our friends: such are the morally good, and those well thought of by every one, by the best men, or by those whom we admire or who admire us.</p>\n\n<p>And also those with whom it is pleasant to live and spend our days: such are the good-tempered, and those who are not too ready to show us our mistakes, and those who are not cantankerous or quarrelsome-such people are always wanting to fight us, and those who fight us we feel wish for the opposite of what we wish for ourselves-and those who have the tact to make and take a joke; here both parties have the same object in view, when they can stand being made fun of as well as do it prettily themselves.</p>\n\n<p>And we also feel friendly towards those who praise such good qualities as we possess, and especially if they praise the good qualities that we are not too sure we do possess.</p>\n\n<p>And towards those who are cleanly in their person, their dress, and all their way of life. And towards those who do not reproach us with what we have done amiss to them or they have done to help us, for both actions show a tendency to criticize us.</p>\n\n<p>And towards those who do not reproach us with what we have done amiss to them or they have done to help us, for both actions show a tendency to criticize us.</p>\n\n<p>And towards those who do not nurse grudges or store up grievances, but are always ready to make friends again; for we take it that they will behave to us just as we find them behaving to everyone else.</p>\n\n<p>And towards those who have some serious feeling towards us, such as admiration for us, or belief in our goodness, or pleasure in our company; especially if they feel like this about qualities in us for which we especially wish to be admired, esteemed, or liked.</p>\n\n<p>And towards those who are like ourselves in character and occupation, provided they do not get in our&nbsp;way or gain their living from the same source as we do-for then it will be a case of &rsquo;potter against potter&rsquo;.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>And those who desire the same things as we desire, if it is possible for us both to share them together; otherwise the same trouble arises here too.</p>\n\n<p>And towards those with whom we are on such terms that, while we respect their opinions, we need not blush before them for doing what is conventionally wrong: as well as towards those before whom we should be ashamed to do anything really wrong.</p>\n\n<p>And those who feel as friendly to us when we are not with them as when we are-which is why all men feel friendly towards those who are faithful to their dead friends.</p>\n\n<p>And, speaking generally, towards those who are really fond of their friends and do not desert them in trouble; of all good men, we feel most friendly to those who show their goodness as friends.</p>\n\n<p>Also towards those who are honest with us, including those who will tell us of their own weak points: it has just said that with our friends we are not ashamed of what is conventionally wrong, and if we do have this feeling, we do not love them; if therefore we do not have it, it looks as if we did love them.</p>\n\n<p>Enmity and Hatred can be referenced using opposite of Friendship.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n","authorId":null,"subject":"philosophy","tags":null,"img":"/images/aristotle.jpg","summary":"Aristotle is one of the founding figures in Western philosophy.
