{"name":"Plato's Meno","id":186,"content":"<p><em>This is extract from Plato&#39;s book MENO. It&#39;s a dialogue between Socrates and Meno. My comments are in [..] brackets</em></p>\n\n<p><em>The structure of the arguments presented in this book:</em></p>\n\n<div style=\"border-left: 0.5px solid black; color: green; padding-left: 2%;\">\n<p><em>Definition of Virtue?</em></p>\n\n<p><em>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;- X,Y, Z </em></p>\n\n<p><em>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; </em>-- But they are examples. That&#39;s not the definition.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;- The power of governing</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; -- But that power can be non-virtuous itself. So we must add &quot;power of governing <strong>justly</strong>&quot;, but then we are using an example of Virtue to define the Virtue.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;- Virtue is the desire of things honorable and the power to attain them.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; -- But again the power of attaining unjustly cannot be Virtue.</p>\n\n<p>Can someone know what is example of Virtue if he does not know Virtue itself?&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Can Virtue be taught?&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Is Virtue knowledge? If yes, then it must be able to be taught?</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; - No?&nbsp;&nbsp;So it means that we already know what Virtue is. This is because our soul remembers when it descended from the world of forms. It is an instinct given by God to the virtuous. The one who has&nbsp;knowledge of this and is able to teach it he alone has understanding (of Virtue)&nbsp;and the rest are fleeting shades.</p>\n</div>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<hr />\n<p>Socrates: What is Virtue?</p>\n\n<p>Meno: Virtue of __ is __.</p>\n\n<p>S: But they are examples (enumeration) of virtue. What is common among them?</p>\n\n<p>M: There is no sameness.</p>\n\n<p>S: [<em>takes one of&nbsp; Meno&#39;s enumeration</em>] Did you not say &quot;Virtue of man is to order a state &amp; Virtue of woman is to order house&quot;. But if they are to be good man &amp; woman, would they not have same virtues of temperance &amp; justice?</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#8e44ad;\"><em>[But this only shows that there is a common virtue, not that there is something common among virtues themselves, but wait...]</em></span></p>\n\n<p>M: Yes...So it is &quot;power of governing&quot;</p>\n\n<p>S: Would you not add &quot;justly and temperately&quot; to that?</p>\n\n<p>M: Yes, as justice is virtue.</p>\n\n<p>S: Justice &quot;is virtue&quot; or &quot;is a virtue&quot;? In the same sense that &quot;round&quot; is a figure, not &quot;round is figure&quot; as there are many other figures.</p>\n\n<p>M: Hmm... There are other virtues: courage, temperance, wisdom, magnanimity, etc.</p>\n\n<p>S: But again, what is common among them? How would I know that something is virtue? <span style=\"color:#8e44ad;\"><em>[Why does it make sense to know the definition of virtue? - Because then you will be able to distinguish what is virtue from what is not, regardless of common belief]</em></span></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Round is a figure/shape, line is a shape, round is no more shape than line. Then what is a shape? How would I identify, that something is a figure/shape?</p>\n\n<p>M: I don&#39;t know what you want or what you are saying!</p>\n\n<p>S: Don&#39;t you understand that I want &quot;simile in multi&quot; &amp; what is that &quot;simile in multi&quot; that includes not only round and line, but all other figures?</p>\n\n<p>S: Will you be satisfied with this definition of figure: &quot;Figure is that which always follows colour&quot;?</p>\n\n<p>M: No, you just used another term &quot;color&quot;, to describe figure. I will ask then &quot;what is color?&quot;</p>\n\n<p>S: Ok, I will tell you using only the terms that you know. You know what it means by when I say &quot;something ended&quot; and you also have heard of surface and solid as in geometry?</p>\n\n<p>M: Yes</p>\n\n<p>S: I define figure to be &quot;that in which the solid ends&quot; or more concisely, &quot;the limit of solid&quot;</p>\n\n<p>M: And what is color?</p>\n\n<p>S: ..Colour is an effluence of form, commensurate with sight, and palpable to sense. (in a style which you&#39;re familiar with (poetical), and because of this familiarity you will find this definition more convincing than the definition of figure, even though that might be more accurate). <span style=\"color:#8e44ad;\"><em>[Nothing new here, or should I say, nothing old here; people understand things which they are familiar with and think that to be excellent]</em></span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#8e44ad;\">[<em>Socrates wants to show that, there must be a common definition for all the virtues</em>]</span></p>\n\n<p>M: ..Well then.. &quot;Virtue is the desire of things honorable, and the power of attaining them&quot;</p>\n\n<p>S: He who desires the honorable also desire the good. Some desire good, and other desire evil. Those who desire evil know that evil is bad/harmful for them? If they think so, they will not desire evil then. So, it means that they think evil to be good for them? <u>So effectively everybody desires good although they mistakenly think evil to be good</u>?</p>\n\n<p>S: So from your definition &quot;Virtue is desire and power of attaining good&quot;, we can remove desire as it is common to everyone. So, &quot;Virtue is power of attaining good&quot;? As if we want to say that someone is more virtuous than other, it cannot mean that someone desires good more than the other, instead of that he has more power of attaining the good?</p>\n\n<p>M: Yes</p>\n\n<p>S: If virtue is power of attaining goods, what are those goods - health, wealth, gold, office, honor?</p>\n\n<p>M: Yes, those are included</p>\n\n<p>S: Then is any mode of acquiring them is virtue, no matter they are unjust and dishonest?</p>\n\n<p>M: No, they are vice.</p>\n\n<p>S: Acquisition of them in honest, just manner is then virtue, and non-acquisition of them in dishonest way or want of them is also virtue?</p>\n\n<p>S: you require justice to define virtue and you also said that justice itself is part of virtue? Similarly, I can say about other parts of virtue, &quot;that every action done with part of virtue is virtue&quot;</p>\n\n<p>S: Can someone who does not know virtue know what is part of virtue?</p>\n\n<p>S: ... But I will join you into the inquiry of virtue&quot;</p>\n\n<p>M: But how will you inquire into something which you don&#39;t know? What will you put forth as the subject of inquiry, and if you find what you know, how will you ever know that this is the thing which you did not know?</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#8e44ad;\">[<em>This is called Meno&#39;s paradox, and it makes seemingly true that we can&#39;t gain knowledge (<strong>especially for the things without proper definition</strong>), Let&#39;s say even though you put forth some example or similar concept as the subject of inquiry, how would you know that this is the thing you did not know and were looking for, as anything similar to your example would seem that it was the thing you didn&#39;t know.</em>]</span></p>\n\n<p>S: ..you are wrong in thinking so...I heard a story from priests and priestesses, ..Soul is immortal, there is birth and dying of man but the soul is never destroyed, and soul having born and died many times, has seen all things that exist whether in this world or the world below, has knowledge of them, and no wonder can recollect those upon ponderance.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yqDoLdmcyZo\" target=\"_blank\">Plato&#39;s Meno: The Geometry Lesson</a></p>\n\n<p>[<span style=\"color:#8e44ad;\"><em>This seems to be a mystic theory and we can say that Socrates was using leading questions to teach the boy, but it&#39;s not all clear; how do mathematicians and scientists discover new theorems? - They use this same methodology, with the only difference that there is no external teacher, they ask questions themselves and find the next step.</em></span>]</p>\n\n<p>In this lesson, the boy goes from &quot;Knowing that he does not know&quot; to &quot;knowing that he thinks he knows&quot; to &quot;knowing and perplexed that he does not know&quot; to &quot;finding that he knows&quot; about the area of square. <span style=\"color:#8e44ad;\"><strong>When he is perplexed, he desires to know.</strong></span></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Can virtue be taught?</p>\n\n<p>Socrates takes example of people around the city. If virtue can be taught, would the gentlemen not have taught their children to be gentleman? Would the Sophists not have taught their students?</p>\n\n<p>So, how is virtue acquired? - For it seems to be there in some people..</p>\n\n<p>Proposition: Knowledge is the only guide of right actions and hence virtue.</p>\n\n<p>S: But suppose there is a man who knows the route to place X, has been to that place, and has led others to that place. And then there is a person who has the right opinion about the way to X, but has never been to that place. Would the second one also not be as good (<em>useful</em>) as the first one?</p>\n\n<p>M: Yes</p>\n\n<p>S: Then, true opinion is also as good guide as knowledge.</p>\n\n<p>M: But that who has knowledge will always be right, and that who has only opinion will be right sometimes.</p>\n\n<p><em>[The question is - what is true opinion?]</em></p>\n\n<p>S: True opinions remain with us until they are fastened by the tie of the cause; and this fastening of them is recollection. But when they are bound, in the first place, they have nature of knowledge. This is why knowledge is more honourable and excellent than true opinion, because fastened by a chain.</p>\n\n<p>S: <strong>I too only conjecture</strong>. There are not many things which I profess to know, but this is most certainly I know that knowledge differs from&nbsp;true opinion.</p>\n\n<p>[<em>Plato puts a lot of </em><em>emphasis</em><em> to portray Socrates as really curious, not just messing around</em>]</p>\n\n<p>S: Good men are useful not only because they have knowledge, but because they have right opinion. Neither knowledge nor right opinion is given to man by nature or acquired by him?</p>\n\n<p>M: No</p>\n\n<p>S: If not given by nature, not acquired by them, virtue must be acquired by teaching?</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#8e44ad;\"><em>[Doesn&#39;t this whole dialog fall&nbsp;off, if we consider that true opinion (roughly translating to intuitions) are also acquired by individual through nature and nurture, just like every other idea is.]</em></span></p>\n\n<p>S: But if virtue cannot be taught, then it means virtue is not knowledge..</p>\n\n<p>S: It leaves us with right opinion as the guide of virtue. And there are examples: diviners, prophets, say many things truly, but they do not know what they say. Those men who have no understanding, yet they succeed in grand deed and word, they are also divine. So poets, statesmen also are divine, possessed of God.</p>\n\n<p>S: To conclude, virtue is neither natural, nor acquired, but an instinct given by God to the virtuous. Nor is the instinct accompanied by reason, otherwise it would be able to teach it to others. If there is someone who can teach it, like Homer said, &quot;he alone has understanding; but the rest are flitting shades&quot;; he and his virtues in like manner will be a reality among shadows.</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#8e44ad;\"><em>[In the light of modern sciences, we can say that the virtues may be acquired through nurture, with nature playing its role at times. But it seems that this development is so complicated that it&#39;s hard to&nbsp;say that it can be taught, or even implanted in someone&#39;s mind. It lies in the category of many unsolved big questions].</em></span></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n","authorId":null,"subject":"philosophy","tags":["basic","intro"],"img":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cupitor-220103.appspot.com/images/plato.jpg","summary":"What is virtue?
