{"name":"Pascal's Pens√©es","id":194,"content":"<p>The following is an extract from Pascal&#39;s book Pens&eacute;es. Actually Pascal didn&#39;t write a book, he wrote notes and letters. Book is the collection of those.</p>\n\n<hr />\n<p>Pens&eacute;es (french) = thoughts</p>\n\n<p>Pascal - a brilliant innovator, scientist. His absorption in the great work he had in mind, left him little time and energy during last 2 yrs of his life.</p>\n\n<p>Pascal&#39;s disillusioned analysis of human bondage is sometimes interpreted to mean that Pascal was really and finally an&nbsp;unbeliever, who, in his despair, was incapable of enduring reality and enjoying the heroic satisfaction of the free man&#39;s worship of nothing. His despair, his disillusion, are, however, no illustration of his personal weakness, they are perfectly objective, because they are essential moments in the progress of the intellectual soul; and for the type of Pascal they are analogue of the drought, the dark night, which is an essential stage in the progress of the Christian mystic.</p>\n\n<h2>Book Excerpt</h2>\n\n<p>There are two types of minds: mathematical [reductionist] and intuitive.</p>\n\n<p>Those who are accustomed to judge by feeling do not understand the process of reasoning, for they would understand at first sight, and are not used to seek for principles. And others, on the contrary, who are accustomed to reason from principles, do not at all understand matters of feeling, seeking principles, and being unable to see at glances.</p>\n\n<p>The understanding and the feelings are moulded by intercourse. The understanding and the feelings are corrupted by intercourse. Thus good or bad society improves or corrupts them. It is, then, all-important to know how to choose in order to improve and not to corrupt them; and we cannot make this choice, if they be not already improved and not corrupted. Thus a circle is formed, and those are fortunate who escape it.</p>\n\n<p>The greater intellect one has, the more originality one finds in men. Ordinary person finds no difference between men.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>People are generally better persuaded by the reasons which they have themselves discovered than by those which have come into the mind of others.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>When a natural discourse paints a passion or an effect, one feels within oneself the truth of what one reads, which was there before, although one did not know. Hence one is inclined to love him who makes us feel it, for he has not shown his own riches, but ours.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Why into &quot;Abstine et sustine&quot; [a maxim of Stoics] rather than &quot;Follow Nature&quot;[maxim in which Stoics summed up their positive ethical teaching], or &quot;Conduct your private affairs with injustice&quot; as Plato, or anything else.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Eloquence. - It requires the pleasant and the real; but the pleasant must itself be drawn from the true.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Ne quid nimis - Nothing in excess, a celebrated maxim in ancient Greek philosophy.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Man is full of wants: he loves only those who can satisfy them all.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Thus when we wish to demonstrate a general theorem, we must give the as applied to a particular case; but if we wish to demonstrate a particular case, we must begin with the general rule.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Do you wish people to believe good of you? Don&#39;t speak.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Too much and too little wine. Give him none, he cannot find truth; give him too much, the same.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>We may enlarge our conceptions beyond all imaginable space; we only produce atoms in comparison with the reality of things. It is an infinite space, the centre of which is everywhere, the circumference nowhere.</p>\n\n<p>He is equally incapable of seeing Nothing from which he was made, and the Infinite in which he is swallowed up.</p>\n\n<p>He who regards himself in this light will be afraid of himself, and observing himself sustained in the body given him by nature between those two abysses of the Infinite and Nothing, will tremble at the sight of these marvels; and I think that, as his curiosity changes into admiration, he will be more disposed to contemplate them in silence than to examine them with presumption.</p>\n\n<p>For in fact what is man in nature? A Nothing in comparison with the Infinite, an All in comparison with the Nothing, a mean between nothing and everything. Since he is infinitely removed from comprehending the extremes, the end of things and their beginning are hopelessly hidden from him in an impenetrable secret; he is equally incapable of seeing the Nothing from which he was made, and the Infinite in which he is swallowed up.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Too much sound deafens us, too much light dazzles us; too great distance or proximity hinders our view. Too great length and too great brevity of discourse tend to obscurity; too much truth is paralysing. First principles are too self-evident for us; too much pleasure disagrees with us. Too many concords are annoying in music, too many benefits irritate us. Extreme youth and extreme age hinder our mind, as also too much and too little education.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>If man made himself the first object of study, he would see how incapable he is of going further. How can a part know the whole? But he may perhaps aspire to know at least the parts to which he bears some proportion. But the parts of the world are so related and linked to one another, that I believe it is impossible to know one without the other and the whole.</p>\n\n<p>Man, for instance , is related to all he knows. He needs a place wherein to abide, time through which to live, motion in order to live, elements to compose him, warmth and food to nourish him, air to breathe. He sees light; he feels bodies; in short, he is in a dependent alliance with everything. To know man, then, it is necessary ti know how it happens that he needs air to live, and, to know the air, we must know how is it thus related to the life of man, etc. Flame cannot exist without air; therefore to understand the one, we must understand the other.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Since everything then is cause and effect, dependent and supporting, mediate and immediate, and all is held together by a natural though imperceptible chain, which binds together things most distant and most different, I hold it equally impossible to know the parts without the whole, and to know the whole without knowing the parts in detail.</p>\n\n<p>And what completes our incapability of knowing things, is the fact that they are simple, and that we are composed of two opposite natures, different in kind, soul and body. For it is impossible that our rational part should be other than spiritual; and&nbsp; if any one maintain that we are simply corporeal, this would far more exclude us from the knowledge of things, there being nothing so inconceivable as to say that matter knows itself. It is impossible to imagine how it should know itself.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>One says that the sovereign good consists in virtue, another in pleasure, another in the knowledge of nature, another in truth, Felix qui potuit rerum cognoscere causas, another in total ignorance, another in indolence, others in disregarding appearances, another in wondering at nothing, nihil admirari prope res una quae possit facere et servare beatum, and others, wiser, think to find a better definition. We are all well satisfied.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>We must see if this fine philosophy have gained nothing certain from so long and so intent study; perhaps at least the soul will know itself.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>How come is that a cripple does not offend us, but a fool does? - Because a cripple recognizes that we walk straight, whereas a fool declares that it is we who are silly; if it were not so, we should feel pity and not anger.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Imagination - This arrogant power, the enemy of reason, who likes to rule and dominate it, has established in man a second nature to show how all powerful she is. She makes men happy and sad, healthy and sick, rich and poor, she compels reason to believe, doubt, and deny; she blunts the senses, or quickens them; she has her fools and sages; and nothing vexes us more than to see that she fills her devotees with a satisfaction far more full and entire than does reason.</p>\n\n<p>Those who have lively imagination are a great deal more pleased with themselves than the wise can reasonably be.</p>\n\n<p>They look down upon men with haughtiness, they argue with boldness and confidence, others with fear and diffidence; and this gaiety of countenance often gives them the advantage in the opinion of the hearers, such favour have the imaginary wise in the eyes of judges of like nature.</p>\n\n<p>Imagination cannot make fools wise, but she can make them happy, to the envy of reason which can only make its friends miserable; the one covers them with glory, the others with shame.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Custom is our nature. He who is accustomed to the faith believes in it, can no longer fear hell, and believes in nothing else. He who is accustomed to believe that the king is terrible ..etc. Who doubts then that our soul, being accustomed to see number, space, motion, believes that and nothing else?</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>When we see the same effect always recur, we infer a natural necessity in it, as that there will be a tomorrow, etc. But nature often deceives us, and does not subject herself to her own rules.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>What are our natural principles but principles of custom? In children they are those which they have received from the habits of their fathers, as hunting in animals. A different custom will cause different natural principles. This is seen in experience; and if there are some natural principles ineradicable by custom, there are also some customs opposed to nature, ineradicable by nature, or by second custom. This depends on disposition.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>But what is nature? For is custom not natural? I am much afraid that nature is itself only a first custom, as custom is a second nature.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>We do not like others to deceive us, we do not think it fair that they should be held in higher esteem by us than they deserve; it is not then fair that we should deceive them, and should wish them to esteem us more highly than we deserve.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Hence it happens that if any have some interest&nbsp; in being loved by us, they are averse to render us a service which they know to be disagreeable. They treat us as we wish to be treated. We hate the truth, and they hide it from us. We desire flattery, and they flatter us. We like to be deceived, and they deceive us.</p>\n\n<p>So each degree of good fortune which raises us in the world removes us farther from truth, because we are most afraid of wounding those whose affection is most useful and whose dislike is most dangerous. Human life is thus only a perpetual illusion; men deceive and flatter each other. No one speaks of us in our presence as he does of us in our absence. Human society is founded on mutual deceit, few friendships would endure if each knew what his friend said of him in his absence, although he then spoke in sincerity and without passion.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>So difficult is it not to upset a judgement from its natural place, or, rather, so rarely is it firm and stable.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>The weather and my mood have little connection. I have my foggy and my fine days within me; my prosperity or misfortune has little to do with the matter.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>As nature makes us always unhappy in every state, our desires picture to us a happy state; because they add to the state in which we are the pleasures of the state in which we are not. And if we attained to these pleasures, we should not be happy after all; because we should have other desires natural to this new state.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Hence it comes that we weep and laugh at the same thing.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Time heals griefs and quarrels, for we change and are no longer the same persons. Neither the offender nor the offended are any more themselves.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>He no longer loves the person whom he loved then years ago. I quite believe it. She is no longer the same, nor is he. He was young, and she also; she is quite different.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Description of man: dependency, desire of independence, need.</p>\n\n<p>Condition of man: inconstancy, weariness, unrest.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>A man dwells at home with pleasure; but if he sees a woman who charms him, or if he enjoys himself in play for five or six days, he is miserable if he returns to his former way of living.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Weariness - Nothing is so insufferable to man as to be completely at rest, without passions, without business, without diversion, without study. He then feels his nothingness, his forlornness, his insufficiency, his dependence, his weakness, his emptiness. There will immediately arise from the depth of his heart weariness, gloom, sadness, fretfulness, vexation, despair.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>We never seek things for themselves, but for the search. Likewise in plays, scenes which do not rouse emotion of fear are worthless, so are extreme and hopeless misery, brutal lust, and extreme cruelty. So is with search of truth.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>A mere trifle consoles us, for a mere trifle distresses us.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>.. I have discovered that all the unhappiness of men arises from one single fact, that they cannot stay quietly in their own chamber.</p>\n\n<p>For when we think closely of ourselves, we discover natural poverty of our feeble and mortal condition, so miserable that&nbsp; nothing can comfort us when we think og it closely, so we have diversions. Hence it comes that play and the society of women, war, and high posts are sought after.</p>\n\n<p>But it is not their fault, they do not know that they are seeking chase not the quarry. Their error does not lie in seeking excitement, if the seek it only as a diversion; the evil is that they seek it as if the possession of the objects of their quest would make them really happy.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Men seek rest in a struggle against difficulties; and when they have conquered these, rest becomes insufferable.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Thus so wretched is man that he would weary even without any cause for weariness from the peculiar state of his disposition; and so frivolous is he, that, though full of a thousand reasons for weariness, the least thing, such as playing billiards or hitting a ball, is sufficient to amuse him. And to what end?&nbsp; To the pleasure of bragging tomorrow that he played better than another.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>This man spends his life without weariness in playing every day for a small stake. Give him each morning the money he can win each day, on condition he does not play; you make him miserable. It will perhaps be said that he seeks the amusement of play and not the winnings. Make him then play for nothing; he will not become excited over it, and will feel bored. It is then not the amusement alone that he seeks; a languid and passionless amusement will weary him. He must get excited over it, and deceive himself by the fancy that he will be happy to win what he would not have as a gift on condition of not playing; and he must make for himself an object of passion, and excite over it his desire, his anger, his fear, to obtain his imagined end, as children are frightened at the face they have blackened.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>However full of sadness a man may be, he is happy for the time, if you can prevail upon him to enter into the amusement; and however happy a man may be, he will soon be disconnected and wretched, if he not be diverted and occupied by some passion or pursuit which prevents weariness from overcoming him. Without amusement there is no joy; with amusement there is no sadness. Persons in high position have a number of people to amuse them, and have the power to keep themselves in this state.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Let us make an experiment, let&#39;s leave a king all alone to reflect on himself quite at leisure, without any gratification of senses, without any care in his mind, without society; and we will see that the king without diversions is a man full of wretchedness.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>How hollow and full of ribaldry is the heart of man!</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>We do not content ourselves with the life we have in ourselves and in our own being; we desire to live and imaginary life in the mind of others, and for this purpose we endeavour to shine. We labour unceasingly to adorn and preserve this imaginary existence, and neglect the real. And if we possess calmness, or generosity, or truthfulness, we are eager to make it known, so as to attach these virtues to that imaginary existence.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>We are so presumptuous that we would wish to be known by all the world, even by people who shall come after, when we shall be no more; and we are so vain that the esteem of five or six neighbours delights and contents us.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Vanity is so anchored in the heart of man that a soldier, a soldier&#39;s servant, a cook, a porter brags, and wishes to have his admirers. Even philosophers wish for them. Those who write against it want to have the glory of having written well, and those who read it desire the glory of having read it. I who write this have perhaps this desire, and perhaps those who read it...</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>He who does not see the vanity of the world is himself very vain. Indeed who do not see it but youths who are absorbed in fame, diversion, and thought of the future? But tale away the diversion, and you will see them dried up with weariness. They feel then nothingness without knowing it; for it is indeed to be unhappy to be in insufferable sadness as soon as we are deduced to thinking of self, and have no diversion.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>We do not rest satisfied with the present. We anticipate the future as too slow in coming, as if in order to hasten its course; or we recall past, to stop its too rapid flight. So imprudent are we that we wander in the times which are not ours, and do not think of the only one which belongs to us; and so idle are that we dream of those times which are no more, and thoughtlessly overlook that which alone exists. For the present is generally painful to us. We conceal it from our sight, because it troubles us; and if it be delightful to us, we regret to see it pass away.</p>\n\n<p>The past and present are our means; the future alone is our end. So we never live, but we hope to live; and, as we are always preparing to be happy, it is inevitable we should never be so.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>[Will man ever finally get the control, as man was once so weak that a simple fever could turn the destiny of a man and hence a kingdom, e.g. Cromwell. But now with money in hand and technologies available one can outlive many diseases. It can be said that if there is God, He still has control in these matters, and still there is mind which we have very little understanding of. But things are changing, humans are gaining more and more control and knowledge.]</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>The sensibility of man to trifles, and his insensibility to great things, indicates a strange inversion.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>That passion may not harm us, let us act as if we had only eight hours to live.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>It is certain that mortality or immortality of the soul must make an entire difference to mortality. And yet the philosophers have constructed their ethics independently of this: they discuss to pass an hour.</p>\n\n<p>Atheists ought to say what is perfectly evident; now it is not perfectly evident that the soul is material.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Is it more difficult to come into existence than to return to it? [To support Jesus&#39; resurrection] Habit makes the one appear easy to us; want of habit makes the other impossible. A popular way of thinking!</p>\n\n<p>Why cannot a virgin bear a child? Does a hen not lay eggs without a cock? And who has told us that the hen may not form the germ as well as the cock?</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>It is incomprehensible that God should exist, and it is incomprehensible that He should not exist; that the soul should be joined to the body, and that we should have no soul; that the world should be created, and that it should not be created, etc.; that the original sin should be, and that it should not be.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>We know that there is an infinite. There is infinity in number. But we do not know what it is. It is not odd, it is not even, yet it is a number, and every number must be even or odd. So we may well know that there is a God without knowing what He is. Is there not one substantial truth, seeing there are so many things which are not the truth itself?</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Wager: You can either believe that God is, or He is not. See it as a wager. If you gain, you gain it all; if you lose, you lose nothing. Wager, then, without hesitation that He is. - &quot;That&#39;s very fine. Yes, I must wager; but I may perhaps wager too much.&quot; - Let is see. Since there is an equal risk of gain and of loss, if you had only to gain two lives, instead of one, you might still wager. But there is an eternity of life and happiness.</p>\n\n<p>Now, what harm will befall you in taking this side? You will be faithful, honest, humble, grateful, generous, a sincere friend, truthful. Certainly you will not have those poisonous pleasures, glory and luxury; but will you not have others? I will tell you that you will thereby gain in this life, and that, at each step you take on this road, you will see so great certainty of gain, so much nothingness in what you risk, that you will at last recognise that you have wagered for something certain and infinite, for which you have given nothing.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>According to doctrine of chance, you ought to put yourself to the trouble of searching for the truth; for if you die without worshipping the True Cause, you are lost. - &quot;But&quot;, say you, &quot;if He had wished me to worship Him, He would have left me signs of His will.&quot;-He has done so; but you neglect them. Seek them, therefore; it is well worth it.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>I would renounce pleasures, had I faith - they say. You would soon have faith, if you renounce pleasure. - I say. You can renounce pleasure and test whether what I say is true.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>There are 3 sources of belief: reason, custom and inspiration. How few things are demonstrated? Proofs only convince the mind. Custom is the source of our strongest and most believed proofs. It bends the automaton which persuades the mind without its thinking about the matter.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>It is right that what is just should be obeyed; it is necessary that what is strongest should be obeyed. Justice without might is helpless; might without justice is tyrannical. Justice without might is gainsaid, because there are always offenders; might without justice is condemned. We must then combine justice and might, and for this end make what is just strong, or what is strong just.</p>\n\n<p>Justice is subject to dispute; might is easily recognised and is not disputed. So we cannot give might to justice, because might has gainsaid justice, and has declared that it is the herself who is just. And this being unable to make what is just strong, we have made what is strong just.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>The only universal rules are the laws of the country in ordinary affairs, and of the majority in others. Whence come this? From the might which is in them. Hence it comes that kings, who have power of a different kind, do not follow the majority of their ministers.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&quot;When a strong man armed keeps his goods, his goods are in peace.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>To be of noble birth us a great advantage. In 18 yrs it places a man within the select circle, known and respected, as another would have merited in 50 yrs. It is a gain of 30 yrs without trouble.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>What is Ego?</p>\n\n<p>Does he who loves someone on account of beauty really love that person? No; for the small-pox, which will kill beauty without killing the person, will cause him to love her no more.</p>\n\n<p>And if one loves me for my judgement, memory, he does not love me, for I can lose these qualities without losing myself. Where, then, is this Ego, if it is neither in my body nor in the soul?</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>The sciences have 2 extremes which meet. First is the pure natural ignorance in which all men find themselves at birth. The other extreme is that reached by great intellects, who, having run through all that men can know, find they know nothing, and come back again to that same ignorance from which they set out; but this is a learned ignorance which is conscious of itself. Those between the two, who have departed from natural ignorance and not been able to reach the other, have some smattering of this vain knowledge, and pretend to be wise.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>We can only think of Plato and Aristotle in grand academic robes. They were honest men, like others, laughing with their friends, and when they diverted themselves with writing their Laws and Politics, they did it as an amusement. That part of their life was the least philosophic and the least serious; the most philosophic was to live simply and quietly. They entered into madmen&#39;s principles&nbsp; who thought they were kings and emperors in order to make their madness as little harmful as possible.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>The discoveries of men from age to age turn out the same. The kindness and the malice of the world in general are the same.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Continuous eloquence wearies. Grandeur must be abandoned to be appreciated. Kings sometimes play. They are not always there on their thrones.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>When we would pursue virtues to their extreme on the either side, vices present themselves, which insinuate themselves insensibly there. We find fault with the perfection itself.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>The mind of this sovereign judge of the world is not so independent that it not liable to be disturbed by the first din about it. The noise of the cannon is not necessary to hinder its thoughts; it needs only the creaking of a weathercock or a pulley. Do not wonder of at present it does not reason well; a fly is buzzing in its ears; that is enough to render it incapable of good judgement. (This was not just a metaphor but refer to an instance when Portuguese were compelled to raise the siege of Tamly on account of the number of flies).</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Chance gives rise to thoughts, and chance removes them; no art can keep or acquire them.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Nothing fortifies scepticism more than that there are some who are not sceptics; if all were so, they would be wrong.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Few men speak humbly of humility, chastely of chastity, few doubtingly of scepticism.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>It is not good to have too much liberty. It is not good to have all one wants.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>If we do not think enough, or if we think too much on any matter, we get obstinate and infatuated about it. If one considers one&#39;s work immediately after having done it, one is entirely prepossessed in its favour; by delaying too long, one can no longer enter into spirit of it.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>When all is equally agitated, nothing appears to be agitated, as in a ship. When all tend to debauchery, none appear to do so. He who stops, draws attention to the excess of others, like a fixed point.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Contradiction is a bad sign of truth; several things which are certain are contradicted; several things which are false pass without contradiction. Contradiction is not a sign of falsity, nor the want of contradiction a sign of truth.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>But what will you say is good? Chastity? I say no; for the world would come to an end. Marriage? No; continence is better. Not to kill? No; for lawlessness would be horrible, and the wicked would kill all the good. To kill? No; for that destroys nature. We possess truth and goodness only in part, and mingled with falsehood and evil.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>If we dreamt the same thing every night, it would affect us as much as the objects we see everyday. But since dreams are all different, and each single one is diversified, what is seen in them affects us much less than what we see when awake, because of its continuity, which is not, however, so continuous and level as not to change too; but it changes less abruptly, except rarely, as when we travel, and when we say, &quot;It seems to me I am dreaming.&quot; For life is a dream a little less inconstant.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>All the principles of sceptics, stoics, atheists, etc., are true. But their conclusions are false, because the opposite principles are also true.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Two things instruct man about his whole nature; instinct and experience.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Glory - The brutes don&#39;t admire each other. A horse does not admire his companions. Not that there is no rivalry between them in a race, but that is of no consequence; for, when in the stable, the heaviest and most ill-formed does not give up his oats to another, as men would have others to do them.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Those who despise men, and put them on a level with the brutes, yet wish to be admired and believed by men, and contradicted themselves by their own feelings; their nature, which is stronger than all, convincing them of the greatness of man more forcibly than reason convinces them of their baseness.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Evil is easy, and has infinite forms; good is almost unique (as believed by Pythagoreans). But a certain kind if evil is as difficult as what we call good, and often on this account such particular evil gets passed as good.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>There is internal war between reason and passion. This internal war of reason against the passions has made a division of those who would have peace into two sects. The first would renounce their passions, and become gods; the others would renounce their reason, and become brute beats.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>It is good to be tired and wearied by the vain search after the true good, that we may stretch out our arms to the Redeemer.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>I would indeed that he should hate in himself the lust which determine his will by itself, so that it many not blind him in making his choice, and may not hinder him when he has chosen.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>We cannot but desire truth and happiness, and are incapable of certainty or happiness. This desire is left to us, partly to punish us, partly to make us perceive wherefrom we are fallen.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>No other religion has proposed to men to hate themselves. No other religion then can please those who hate themselves, and who seek a Being truly lovable. And these, if they had never heard of the religion of a God humiliated, would embrace it at once.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>It is unworthy of God to unite Himself to wretched man; but it is not unworthy of God to pull him out of his misery. If we would say that man is too insignificant to deserve communication with God, we must indeed be very great to judge of it.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>But in proof of Jesus Christ we have the prophecies, which are solid and palpable proofs. And these prophecies, being accomplished and proved true by the event, mark the certainty of these truths, and therefore the divinity of Christ. Apart from Him, and without the Scripture, without original sin, without a necessary Mediator promised and come, we cannot absolutely prove God, nor teach right doctrine and right morality.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>I love poverty because He loved it. I love riches because they afford me the means of helping the very poor. I keep faith with everybody; I do not render evil to those who wrong me, but I wish them a lot like mine, in which I receive neither evil not good from men. I try to be just, true, sincere, and faithful to all men; I have a tender heart for those to whom God has more closely united me; and whether I am alone, or seen of men, I do all my actions in the sight of God, who must judge of them, and to whom I have consecrated them all.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n","authorId":null,"subject":"philosophy","tags":["basic","intro"],"img":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/98/Blaise_Pascal_Versailles.JPG/220px-Blaise_Pascal_Versailles.JPG","summary":"Pascal's thoughts on general condition of humans and on God.","lastUpdated":"2018-07-05T04:31:51.061+0000"}
