I took the (vaguely remembered)&nbsp;approach just by syntactic (just going by words)&nbsp;linking of approach with the sort of the problem, rather than thinking from the first principles and then building on them, even though I have recently practised it a bit (maybe that wasn&#39;t enough?).&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>I was asked to print the boundary traversal of a binary tree, I made the same mistake that I would have made 1 year ago (quickly linked with a recursive approach and could not figure out the pitfall) ... that&#39;s no&nbsp;progress...&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Maybe there is a deeper problem here with me. I think that if I stick to this approach, and there is a gap, I will magically find a way to fill the gap. Maybe sometimes gap can&#39;t be filled, you have to change the approach altogether. (But how do I make sure that the gap can&#39;t be filled?)</p>\n\n<p>But after inspection, I found that I wasn&#39;t wrong about the solution, the problem seems to be my presentation of the solution.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n", "authorId": 1, "subject": "hidden", "tags": ["basic", "intro"], "img": "", "summary": "", "lastUpdated": "2021-06-27 11:04:22.903952"}
