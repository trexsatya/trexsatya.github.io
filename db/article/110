We humans start with a conciuosness (including mind and physical form) given at birth and we accumulate on them, enhance them and present ourselves the way we are.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;A child feels connected to everyone (as seen mostly), but when it&nbsp; grows it can connect only to some (specific). This is because the way the child has developed. As per the ideas, cognitions the child divides the world into segments in its mind. And favors the segment where it faces least differences (so in order to reduce the stress caused due to differences/conflicts).</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The right and wrong: Nothing is right and Nothing is wrong per se. Right and Wrong are relative terms. You have to stand in a particular frame of reference to see their validity. And as&nbsp;per your intelligence (and intellect - i.e. your processing capability of knowledge) you can see (and prove) anything right or wrong. Mostly we tend to prove right and wrong by comparisions i.e. if something is ubiquitous, it&#39;s normal and if something is normal it&#39;s right already.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Human Love: Human love arises from needs (starting with set of { Food, Physical&nbsp;Comfort, Social Comfort, &nbsp;Emotional, &nbsp;Spiritual, ...} ). Food, Physical&nbsp;Comfort are prevalent while childhood. Most people are stuck at Emotional needs at max.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Human Fear: Arises from the stress caused by aniticpatedly falling short on one of these needs&nbsp;{ Food, Physical&nbsp;Comfort, Social Comfort, &nbsp;Emotional, &nbsp;Spiritual, ...&nbsp;}.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Why the writers of scriptures wrote those things that they did, you will never know. But the way you interpret those tells a lot about your intellect.</p>\n","authorId":null,"subject":"pdev","tags":null,"img":null,"summary":null,"lastUpdated":null}
