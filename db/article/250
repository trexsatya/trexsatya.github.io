{"name": "Chanakya Neeti", "id": 250, "content": "<p><em>A collection of writings from <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chanakya\" target=\"_blank\">Chanakya</a>. He basically talks about what a person should do for a good social life. Some of the things are still relevant, others might have become obsolete.</em></p>\n\n<p><em>It seems like Chanakya spoke on two fronts: for common people, for wise, saintly people. Sometimes, the things said on these two fronts contradict each other.</em></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong><em>Things which cause problem for a person:</em></strong></p>\n\n<p>Advising fools, Caretaking/keeping a <strong><em>spoiled woman</em></strong>, keeping company of negative/suffering people. <em>[All these terms need a definition though: fool, spoiled, negative]</em></p>\n\n<p>Spoiled wife, Mean/abject friends, disobedient servant, snake</p>\n\n<p>Of a rascal and a serpent, the serpent is the better of the two, for he strikes only at the time he is destined to kill, while the former at every step.</p>\n\n<p>Do not keep company with a fool for as we can see he is a two-legged beast. Like an unseen thorn he pierces the heart with his sharp words.</p>\n\n<p>Scriptural lessons not put into practice are poison; a meal is poison to him who suffers from indigestion; a social gathering is poison to a poverty-stricken person; and a young wife is poison to an aged man.</p>\n\n<p>That man who is without religion and mercy should be rejected. A guru without spiritual knowledge should be rejected. The wife with an offensive face should be given up, and so should relatives who are without affection.</p>\n\n<p>The king is obliged to accept the sins of his subjects; the purohit (priest) suffers for those of the king; a husband suffers for those of his wife; and the guru suffers for those of his pupils.</p>\n\n<p>A father who is a chronic debtor, an adulterous mother, a beautiful wife, and an unlearned son are enemies ( in one&#39;s own home).</p>\n\n<p>It is better to be without a kingdom than to rule over a petty one; better to be without a friend than to befriend a rascal; better to be without a disciple than to have a stupid one; and better to be without a wife than to have a bad one.</p>\n\n<p>How can people be made happy in a petty kingdom? What peace can we expect from a rascal friend? What happiness can we have at home in the company of a bad wife? How can renown be gained by instructing an unworthy disciple?</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>Priorities:</strong></p>\n\n<p><em><strong>Wealth:</strong></em></p>\n\n<p>Accumulation of wealth for possible adverse future.</p>\n\n<p>Priority: Self &gt; Protection of woman &gt; Wealth</p>\n\n<p>(Even accumulation goes away some time)</p>\n\n<p><strong><em>Sacrifice:</em></strong></p>\n\n<p>Give up a member to save a family, a family to save a village, a village to save a country, and the country to save yourself.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>The house of a childless person is a void, all directions are void to one who has no relatives, the heart of a fool is also void, <strong><em>but to a poverty-stricken man all is void</em></strong>.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong><em>Where should a person live?</em></strong></p>\n\n<p>Presence of these things required :</p>\n\n<p>Respect, Occupation, Friendship and brotherhood, Means of education</p>\n\n<p>Prosperous businessmen/traders, Ved-following brahmans (or, <em>intellectuals in todays world</em>), Just, politically able ruler (or, <em>leaders in today&#39;s world</em>), Rivers, Doctors</p>\n\n<p>Trade/Business, Penalty-system, social-shaming (or maybe social-credit) system, Wisdom, Cleverness</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong><em>Run away when required</em></strong></p>\n\n<p>He who runs away from a fearful calamity, a foreign invasion, a terrible famine, and the companionship of wicked men is safe.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong><em>Who is true X?</em></strong></p>\n\n<p>Friend, brother -&nbsp; who helps in the times of disease, troublehood, fear of enemy, death of relatives.</p>\n\n<p>Wife - who is with you even in destitute conditions.</p>\n\n<p>She is a true wife who is clean (suci), expert, chaste, pleasing to the husband, and truthful.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong><em>What is a Good X?</em></strong></p>\n\n<p>Son - obedient, Father - who can raise, nourish child, Wife - who gives happiness, Friend - who is trustworthy, and not a betrayer.</p>\n\n<p>What good is a cow that neither gives milk nor conceives?

No education =&gt; No respect among educated.</p>\n\n<p>Though men be endowed with beauty and youth and born in noble families, yet&nbsp;without education they are like the palasa flower, which is void of sweet fragrance.</p>\n\n<p>Learning is like a cow of desire. It, like her, yields in all seasons. Like a mother, it feeds you on your journey. Therefore learning is a hidden treasure.</p>\n\n<p>Education can give ability only to a person deserving (who has capacity to learn)&nbsp;it.</p>\n\n<p>One destitute of wealth is not destitute, he is indeed rich (if he is learned); but the man devoid of learning is destitute in every way.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong><em>Strictness vs Softness</em></strong></p>\n\n<p>Children, Disciples/students get spoiled with much softness, so strictness is required.</p>\n\n<p>Fondle a son until he is five years of age, and use the stick for another ten years, but when he has attained his sixteenth year treat him as a friend.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong><em>Things which burn the body</em></strong></p>\n\n<p>Separation from wife, Disrespect from relatives, Debt, Service of cruel/unjust ruler.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong><em>Power</em></strong></p>\n\n<p>Power of Intellectuals in Knowledge&nbsp;Rulers &rarr;&nbsp;Army, Traders&nbsp;&rarr; Money, Uneducated&nbsp;&rarr; Service</p>\n\n<p>Consider again and again the following: the right time, the right friends, the right place, the right means of income, the right ways of spending, and from whom you derive your power.</p>\n\n<p>The power of a king lies in his mighty arms; that of a brahmana in his spiritual knowledge; and that of a woman in her beauty youth and sweet words.</p>\n\n<p>He who possesses intelligence is strong; how can the man that is unintelligent be powerful? The elephant of the forest having lost his senses by intoxication was tricked into a lake by a small rabbit. (this verse refers to a famous story from the niti-sastra called pancatantra compiled by the pandit Vishnusharma 2500 years ago).</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>The elephant has a huge body but is controlled by the ankusha (goad): yet, is the goad as large as the elephant? A lighted candle banishes darkness: is the candle as vast as the darkness. A mountain is broken even by a thunderbolt: is the thunderbolt therefore as big as the mountain? No, he whose power prevails is really mighty; what is there in bulk?</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong><em>Control</em></strong></p>\n\n<p>He who neither rouses fear by his anger, nor confers a favour when he is pleased can neither control nor protect. What can he do?</p>\n\n<p>The serpent may, without being poisonous, raise high its hood, but the show of terror is enough to frighten people -- whether he be venomous or not.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong><em>Saints and Good People</em></strong></p>\n\n<p>At the time of the pralaya (universal destruction) the oceans are to exceed their limits and seek to change, but a saintly man never changes.</p>\n\n<p>The beauty of a cuckoo is in its notes, that of a woman in her unalloyed devotion to her husband, that of an ugly person in his scholarship, and that of an ascetic in his forgiveness.</p>\n\n<p>There is no poverty for the industrious. Sin does not attach itself to the person&nbsp;practicing japa (chanting of the holy names of the Lord). Those who are absorbed in maunam (silent contemplation of the Lord) have no quarrel with others. They are fearless who remain always alert.</p>\n\n<p>Fish, tortoises, and birds bring up their young by means of sight, attention and touch; so do saintly men afford protection to their associates by the same means.</p>\n\n<p>He whose hands are clean does not like to hold an office; he who desires nothing cares not for bodily decorations; he who is only partially educated cannot speak agreeably; and he who speaks out plainly cannot be a deceiver.</p>\n\n<p>Heaven is but a straw to him who knows spiritual life (Krsna consciousness); so is life to a valiant man; a woman to him who has subdued his senses; and the universe to him who is without attachment for the world.</p>\n\n<p>The happiness and peace attained by those satisfied by the nectar of spiritual tranquillity is not attained by greedy persons restlessly moving here and there.</p>\n\n<p>Brahmanas find satisfaction in a good meal, peacocks in the peal of thunder, a sadhu in seeing the prosperity of others, and the wicked in the misery of others.</p>\n\n<p>Purity of speech, of the mind, of the senses, and a compassionate heart are needed by one who desires to rise to the divine platform.</p>\n\n<p>He who desires sense gratification must give up all thoughts of acquiring knowledge; and he who seeks knowledge must not hope for sense gratification. How can he who seeks sense gratification acquire knowledge, and he who possesses knowledge enjoy mundane sense pleasure?</p>\n\n<p>He who is engrossed in family life will never acquire knowledge;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong><em>Guesthood</em></strong></p>\n\n<p>Just have a meal and get away just like Prostitues get away from poor, Citizens get away from defeated/powerless ruler, Birds get away from fruitless trees.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><em><strong>Happiness and Sorrow</strong></em></p>\n\n<p>In this world, whose family is there without blemish? Who is free from sickness and grief? Who is forever happy?</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>A man&#39;s descent may be discerned by his conduct, his country by his pronunciation of language, his friendship by his warmth and glow, and his capacity to eat by his body.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong><em>Preservation and Retention</em></strong></p>\n\n<p>Learning is retained through putting into practice; family prestige is maintained through good behavior; a respectable person is recognized by his excellent qualities; and anger is seen in the eyes.</p>\n\n<p>Religion is preserved by wealth; knowledge by diligent practice; a king by conciliatory words; and a home by a dutiful housewife.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong><em>Destiny of a person</em></strong></p>\n\n<p>These five: the&nbsp;life span, the type of work, wealth, learning and the time of one&#39;s death are determined while one is in the womb.</p>\n\n<p><strong><em>Extending the Limits</em></strong></p>\n\n<p>What is too heavy for the strong and what place is too distant for those who put forth effort? What country is foreign to a man of true learning? Who can be inimical to one who speaks pleasingly?</p>\n\n<p><strong><em>Mortality and Impermance (of everything including relationships)</em></strong></p>\n\n<p>As long as your body is healthy and under control and death is distant, try to save your soul; when death is imminent what can you do?</p>\n\n<p>(Through the night) a great many kinds of birds perch(Sit and rest) on a tree but in the morning they fly in all the ten directions. Why should we lament (Expression of sorrow) for that? (Similarly, we should not grieve when we must inevitably part company from our dear ones).</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><em><strong>Aging</strong></em></p>\n\n<p>Constant travel brings old age upon a man; a horse becomes old by being constantly tied up; lack of sexual contact with her husband brings old age upon a woman; and garments become old through being left in the sun.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><em><strong>Envy</strong></em></p>\n\n<p>The learned are envied by the foolish; rich men by the poor; chaste women by adulteresses; and beautiful ladies by ugly ones.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong><em>Remedies</em></strong></p>\n\n<p>Charity puts and end to poverty; righteous conduct to misery; discretion to ignorance; and scrutiny to fear.</p>\n\n<p>An elephant is controlled by a goad (ankusha), a horse by a slap of the hand, a horned animal with the show of a stick, and a rascal with a sword.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong><em>Conciliation</em></strong></p>\n\n<p>Conciliate a covetous man by means of a gift, an obstinate man with folded hands in salutation, a fool by humouring him, and a learned man by truthful words.</p>\n\n<p>Conciliate a strong man by submission, a wicked man by opposition, and the one whose power is equal to yours by politeness or force.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong><em>Supreme Virtues and Vices</em></strong></p>\n\n<p>There is no disease (so destructive) as lust; no enemy like infatuation; no fire like wrath; and no happiness like spiritual knowledge.</p>\n\n<p>There is no water like rainwater; no strength like one&#39;s own; no light like that of the eyes; and no wealth more dear than food grain.</p>\n\n<p>Among men the barber is cunning; among birds the crow; among beasts the jackal; and among women, the malin (flower girl).</p>\n\n<p>Among birds the crow is vile; among beasts the dog; the ascetic whose sins is abominable, but he who blasphemes others is the worst chandala.</p>\n\n<p>There is no austerity equal to a balanced mind, and there is no happiness equal to contentment; there is no disease like covetousness, and no virtue like mercy.</p>\n\n<p>Nectar (amrita) is the best among medicines; eating good food is the best of all types of material happiness; the eye is the chief among all organs; and the head occupies the chief position among all parts of the body.</p>\n\n<p>Those who are destitute of learning, penance, knowledge, good disposition, virtue and benevolence are brutes wandering the earth in the form of men. They are burdensome to the earth.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><em><strong>Blindness of Vice</strong></em></p>\n\n<p>Those born blind cannot see; similarly blind are those in the grip of lust. Proud men have no perception of evil; and those bent on acquiring riches see no sin in their actions.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><em><strong>Equivalent to Parents</strong></em></p>\n\n<p>These five are your fathers; he who gave you birth, girdled you with sacred thread, teaches you, provides you with food, and protects you from fearful situations.</p>\n\n<p>These five should be considered as mothers; the king&#39;s wife, the preceptor&#39;s wife, the friend&#39;s wife, your wife&#39;s mother, and your own mother.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong><em>Purity</em></strong></p>\n\n<p>Brass is polished by ashes; copper is cleaned by tamarind; a woman, by her menses; and a river by its flow.</p>\n\n<p>Water seeping into the earth is pure; and a devoted wife is pure; the king who is the benefactor of his people is pure; and pure is the brahmana who is contented.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong><em>Common Wisdom</em></strong></p>\n\n<p>A wise man should not reveal his loss of wealth, the vexation of his mind, the misconduct of his own wife, base words spoken by others, and disgrace that has befallen him.</p>\n\n<p>He who gives up shyness in monetary dealings, in acquiring knowledge, in eating and in business, becomes happy.</p>\n\n<p>One should feel satisfied with the following three things; his own wife, food given by Providence and wealth acquired by honest effort;&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>But one should never feel satisfied with the following three; study, chanting the holy names of the Lord (japa) and charity.</p>\n\n<p>Keep one thousand cubits away from an elephant, a hundred from a horse, ten from a horned beast, but keep away from the wicked by leaving the country.</p>\n\n<p>Do not be very upright in your dealings for you would see by going to the forest that straight trees are cut down while crooked ones are left standing.</p>\n\n<p>He who has wealth has friends and relations; he alone survives and is respected as a man.</p>\n\n<p>By going to the den of a lion pearls from the head of an elephant may be obtained; but by visiting the hole of a jackal nothing but the tail of a calf or a bit of the hide of an ass may be found.</p>\n\n<p>We should carefully scrutinise that place upon which we step (having it ascertained to be free from filth and living creatures like insects, etc.); we should drink water which has been filtered (through a clean cloth); we should speak only those words which have the sanction of the satras; and do that act which we have carefully considered.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><em><strong>What you eat matters</strong></em></p>\n\n<p>The lamp eats up the darkness and therefore it produces blackened lamp; in the same way according to the nature of our diet (sattva, rajas, or tamas) we produce offspring in similar quality.</p>\n\n<p>The wise who discern the essence of things have declared that the yavana (meat eater) is equal in baseness to a thousand candalas (the lowest class), and hence a yavana is the basest of men; indeed there is no one more base.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;Water is the medicine for indigestion; it is invigorating when the food that is eaten is well digested; it is like nectar when drunk in the middle of a dinner; and it is like poison when taken at the end of a meal.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>A man who encounters the following three is unfortunate; the death of his wife in his old age, the entrusting of money into the hands of relatives, and depending upon others for food.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong><em>Deterioration</em></strong></p>\n\n<p>Beauty is spoiled by an immoral nature; noble birth by bad conduct; learning, without being perfected; and wealth by not being properly utilised.</p>\n\n<p>Discontented brahmanas, contented kings, shy prostitutes, and immodest housewives are ruined.</p>\n\n<p>Those base men who speak of the secret faults of others destroy themselves like serpents who stray onto anthills.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong><em>Mukti</em></strong></p>\n\n<p>My dear child, if you desire to be free from the cycle of birth and death, then abandon the objects of sense gratification as poison.
