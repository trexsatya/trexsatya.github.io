When asked whose arm is this, they say I don&#39;t know. Even when you prick that arm and ask &quot;are you feeling the pain&quot; they say yes, but then again if you ask whose arm is feeling pain, they say I don&#39;t know. So, even though experience is there, it is not integrated with their sense of self.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0278262611000959\" target=\"_blank\">Anarchic Hand Syndrome</a></p>\n\n<p>There are patients who think that thoughts are being inserted in their mind by someone else. Their own thoughts are not integrated with the sense of their self.</p>\n\n<p>There are people who lose sense of some words, those words seem just like noises to them.</p>\n\n<p>All of these imply that there is no one whole &quot;self&quot;, it&#39;s formed of modules. And all the modules when functioning together give a sense of unified &quot;self&quot;.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cerebral_achromatopsia#Bilateral_and_hemifield\" target=\"_blank\">Hemiachromotopsia</a>:&nbsp; On half side, left or right you lose perception of the color.</p>\n\n<p>Not only color perception, there is a disorder in which patients lose the perception of motion. They see the objects at one point, and the next moment see the object at another point like transported, they don&#39;t see the motion.</p>\n\n<p>This suggests that our perceptions are also resultant from brains.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gAXiq31HE_I&amp;list=PLFJr3pJl27pIUFD6fXVO0b7Zvy7T_KdrP\" target=\"_blank\">Closer To Truth</a></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Serotonergic Hallucinogens a.k.a.
