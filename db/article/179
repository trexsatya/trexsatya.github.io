Faith (in most of the cases (not all) it is <em>Blind Faith, </em>they provide no reasoning other than that it has been said by the God)</li>\n\t<li>&nbsp;Mythologies and Glorious Stories - basically everything that is important to people who believe in it <em>regardless of whether it can be proved to be true or not</em>.&nbsp;<br />\n\t&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Most of the&nbsp;religions have&nbsp;some scriptures/books, that continue the <strong>myths</strong>&nbsp;from one generation to the other.&nbsp;<br />\n\t&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

style=\"width: 246px; height: 200px;\" />&nbsp;surveyed in around 57 countries of the world</p>\n\n<p>On average, women are more religious than men. Some people follow multiple religions (&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syncretism\" title=\"\">syncretism</a>).&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h2>Understanding a Religion</h2>\n\n<p>Have you heard a response to &quot;Why does God not show up&quot;? - God shows up only before the true believers. (But once you become a true believer, it does not matter whether God really shows up or not, you will see him).</p>\n\n<p>One cannot truly understand a religion unless one immerses oneself into it. But once you immerse yourself into some religion, there might be no coming back (there is a possibility that you will miss the &quot;real truth&quot; if there is one, or maybe religion is the truth, but which one?).</p>\n\n<p><strong>Why someone follows a specific religion, or does not follow any religion?</strong></p>\n\n<p>There are people who have blind faith. Why?</p>\n\n<p>There are people who do not have blind faith, just faith even though they know most of the sciences, most of the arguments against existence of God.</p>\n\n<p>There are gullible people who are manpulated to believe because of fear (that if not converted they will rot in hell etc..), greed (gifts of conversion).</p>\n\n<p>There are gullible people who are constantly expecting something from God and religions offer a hope that they will receive from the God. In this desperate hope they believe, convert, seek.</p>\n\n<p>Religions provide a framework, a community (rather thriving community) and community is one of the basic needs of humans.</p>\n\n<p><strong>What are the effects of Religions?</strong></p>\n\n<p>Some people find meaning in their life. Their life was meaningless <em>(Why is their life meaningless in the first place?)</em>, and after getting into religion they find meaning <em>(even if it is an illusion)</em>. This meaning can be one or many of these:</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>Do good for community (or sometimes the world in general)</li>\n\t<li>Conduct a good and holy life with integrity, etc..</li>\n\t<li>Help other people understand the religion and convert them</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Some people become very good as a result. They do things which don&#39;t make sense otherwise e.g. helping others (victims) by sacrificing their personal joys, forgiving even the murderer of their child. In short they become the epitome of some virtues.</p>\n\n<p>Some people become aggressive and passionate as a result. Like those who focus on &quot;spreading the religion&quot;. They focus on the ultimate kingdom of their God, and how it will be all well, and they want to get there at any cost, even if it involves blood of innocents.</p>\n\n<p>Some people see the bigger picture as a result and treat the whole humanity as a family, others are more focussed on their ideas, myths, lands and temples/mosques/synagogues/churches/monastries etc.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Why these different results?</strong></p>\n\n<p>Many factors play roles in this. Their upbringing, their mental capacity of understanding, reasoning <em>(Different people will interpret the same thing differently)</em> etc. There life affairs, there circumstances.</p>\n\n<p>And of course, there are people who use religion as a tool to rule people. But that&#39;s not just about religion, those people use everything to rule people.</p>\n\n<h3>Abrahamic Religions</h3>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tower_of_Babel\" target=\"_blank\">Tower of Babel</a> explains <em><strong>Why there are different people speaking different languages and having different concepts of God if there is only one God?</strong></em></p>\n\n<p><em>So the God in order to stop man&#39;s venture, divided men among different languages and gods?&nbsp;And then sent Abraham to unite them again?</em></p>\n\n<p>Abraham <em>(a.k.a. Ibrahim in Islam)</em> was a rebellion against idol-worshipping. He argued with his father (in early age) and his king (Nimrod). The king accused him of impedance and had him hurled down into the fires beneath. But with God&#39;s blessings, the fireground became a huge lake and Abraham was saved. All three abrahamic religions <em>(Christianity, Judaism, Islam)</em> have tales like this.</p>\n\n<p>At some point in his life Abraham desparately wanted a child, but his wife Sarah was considered to be barren. So Abraham married his Egyptian maid Hagar. Hagar produced Ishmael. But miracle as it was, 13 years later Sarah produced a child Isaac. Sarah wanted Hagar and Ishmael to be banished. The children were separated.</p>\n\n<p>God demanded Abraham to show his true devotion and faith by sacrificing one of his children. He and his son were prepared to obey this divine command, but God redeemed the sacrifice with a magnificent ram. Who was that children? Different texts name different one. Muslim texts say it was Ishmael, Jews texts say it was Isaac. The story here could be misunderstood by people. God appears to setup a sacrifice, but only to tell man that he DOES NOT want human blood. He never wanted the sacrifice, it was just a test of Abraham&#39;s devotion.</p>\n\n<p>Muslims trace the line of their prophet Mohammed to Ishmael. Jews assert that Isaac is the most significant of the two of them and they insist that Bible says that the land of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canaan\" target=\"_blank\">Canaan</a> (a.k.a. <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Land_of_Israel\" target=\"_blank\">Land Of Israel</a>) will be given to Isaac.</p>\n\n<p>Ishmael settled in Mecca. Kabaa in Mecca (in Saudi Arabia) is central place for Muslims.</p>\n\n<p>Anti-Semitism (Semitic word comes from &quot;Shem&quot; who was one of three of Noah&#39;s children) is the hatred and movement against Jews which are considered second-grade and deficient members of Abrahamic family.</p>\n\n<p>How and when did Judaism, Christianity, and Islam got their origin? - It&#39;s complicated, unsettled history.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Commonalities and Crucial Differences among Christianity, Islam, and Judaism. </strong></p>\n\n<p>There are historical as well as theological commonalities and differences among these religions.</p>\n\n<p>Historic Commonalities: Common parent is Abraham. However the stories regarding Abraham differs in their texts.</p>\n\n<p>Theological Commonalities and Differences.</p>\n\n<p>All of the monotheistic faiths share a belief that God, the Creator, has &ldquo;spoken&rdquo; to humankind over time. The word for this divine communication is &ldquo;revelation.&rdquo; It comes from the word &ldquo;reveal&rdquo; (to make visible or apparent). Adherents of the Abrahamic religions believe that God revealed Himself to certain individuals called prophets over the course of human history. They believe that God communicated five main messages: (1) the nature and qualities of the one God; (2) the purpose and nature of the universe created by God; (3) the need to worship one God; (4) the purpose of human life and the need to live a righteous life and the news of judgment after death, and reward or punishment in the afterlife, (5) morals and laws which people are told to follow.</p>\n\n<p>Abraham is very important to the monotheistic faiths, but he was not the first leader. Adam and Eve are the first human beings mentioned in the scriptures as receiving revelation from God. Other prophets included Elijah, Isaiah, Noah, Jonah, Abraham, Jacob, Moses, David and Solomon. <a href=\"http://interfaithexplorers.com/for-teachers/teaching-information-and-guidance/the-three-abrahamic-faiths\" target=\"_blank\">See this link</a>.</p>\n\n<h2>Christian and Jews differences:</h2>\n\n<p>Early differences were result of state of affairs of these groups&#39; with regard to Roman kingdom.</p>\n\n<p>New Testament differences:</p>\n\n<p>Jesus is rejected in <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judaism\" title=\"Judaism\">Judaism</a> as a failed <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jewish_Messiah_claimants\" title=\"Jewish Messiah claimants\">Jewish Messiah claimant</a> and a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/False_prophet#Judaism\" title=\"False prophet\">false prophet</a>.<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-BergerDWyschogrodM_14-0\"><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antisemitism_in_Christianity#cite_note-BergerDWyschogrodM-14\">[14]</a></sup><sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-SingerT_15-0\"><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antisemitism_in_Christianity#cite_note-SingerT-15\">[15]</a></sup><sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-KaplanA_16-0\"><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antisemitism_in_Christianity#cite_note-KaplanA-16\">[16]</a></sup> Belief in the divinity of any human being is incompatible with <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judaism\" title=\"Judaism\">Judaism</a>:<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-SingerT-Monotheism_17-0\"><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antisemitism_in_Christianity#cite_note-SingerT-Monotheism-17\">[17]</a></sup><sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-SpiroK_18-0\"><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antisemitism_in_Christianity#cite_note-SpiroK-18\">[18]</a></sup></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If Christianity had come from Judaism and Jesus was a Jew, how and why did the Jews reject such core elements of Christianity? Christians consider that Jews had been the chosen people but broke the covenant with God, and were condemned to spend the rest of eternity suffering on earth, a symbol of degradation and sub-humanity. <em>(Why?)</em></p>\n\n<p>New Testament is the result of contention between Paul (who had not been in contact with real/historic Jesus, but believed that he was in contact with heavenly Jesus after his death) and James (who was Jesus&#39;s brother, one of the three brothers). Paul once oppressed Christians later lead the movement with his own version of Jesus. Paul was a sophisticated person, wealthy, powerful as well unlike James. Conflicts between James and Paul included things like Paul allowing non-Jewish to join the movement, without making sure that they adhere to Jewish laws, and whether to circumcise non-Jewish joining the movement. Ultimately Paul won the game, and wrote the his own version of history, autobiography of Jesus which prevails today. (Source: <a href=\"https://youtu.be/7ftrUdKFKZg\" target=\"_blank\">YouTube Documentary</a>). Jews of Jerusalem rebelled against Rome and were crushed in the process. At the same time New Testament was being written. Gospels of Jarusalem chruch did not survive.</p>\n\n<p>But the New Testament writers like Matthew got their story from original gospels, so there can be found hints in New Testament itself. Virgin Birth of Jesus (out of mother Virgin Mary) could be a modification, because Paul&#39;s Jesus was meant to be a central divine figure (Son of God). Maybe birth place was modified because they had to show that Jesus was the Savior from the starting since birth, so it was written that he was born in Bethelem. Most probably he was born in Nazarath (in Palestine) which was at war with Romans for a very long time. <em>(It is very suspecious that Roman word is hardly mentioned in New Testament gospels, no criticisms!!)</em>. John (a propheter) baptized Jesus and was his mentor (new gospels try to reduce John&#39;s role in order to put Jesus in divine shade). Jesus could have been married as well Mary (who is lady represented as one who anointed Jesus&#39;s body) (Rabiis that time were mostly married). At the time of Revelation, Peter who said to Jesus that &quot;You are the Messiah&quot;, he could have meant the king instead of some divine figure (at that time Messiah meant The Anointed One, given to every desendent of king David) Chirst was simply a greek translation of word Messiah. Jesus&#39;s arrival to Jerusalem could have been a political quest instead of &#39;bringing Jewish leaders back to the path of God&#39; as represented in gospels. The Jesus&#39;s acts against Jews temple could have been not because of Jews leader&#39;s corruption, but instead against Romans who actually controlled the place and Jews were just puppets. Judas Kiss could have been a mythological necessity (<em>a martyr hero needs a betrayal afterall !!</em> See how the name Judas is close to Judaism (Jews) to highlight that Jesus was betrayed by Jewish people). New gospels say that Jews punished Jesus for blasphemy, but at that time the punishment for Jews blasphemy was stoning and crucification was a Roman thing. The execution of Jesus could have been Roman punishment for poilitical reasons.</p>\n\n<h2>Christian and Islam Differences</h2>\n\n<p>It&#39;s interesting that Quran and new chritian gospels share similar stories about Jesus like Virgin Birth and miracles performed by Jesus, Jesus being celibate etc.&nbsp;It also mentions Second Coming of Jesus. But Quran claims that Jesus was a muslim. Islam rejects Jesus as Son Of God, or a divine child. It believes that Jesus was saved by God. In short, Islam sees Jesus as just another prophet chosen by God to spread his message. Islam&#39;s most prominent theory regarding Jesus&#39;s death is that he never physically died, he was raised to heaven and God transformed another person to look just like him who was crucified instead of Jesus. Orthodox muslims take this literally, modern scholors take this as spiritual raising of Jesus rather than physical. Muslims believe that Jesus was a precursor to Muhammad and had prophesized Muhhammad&#39;s coming as he mentioned the cmoning of a prophet named Ahmad.</p>\n\n<h2>Scriptures</h2>\n\n<p>The scripture of Judaism is the Torah, which is the first part of the Tanakh. The first five books, the Torahcontains the revelation that was given to Moses. The Tanakhincludes the Teaching (Torah)and the books of the Prophets (Nevi&rsquo;im), the Psalms, Proverbs and other writings (Ketuvim), 24 books in all. The name Tanakh is an acronym formed from the initial Hebrew letters of the texts three traditional parts-hence TaNaKh Itcontains history, law, poetry and song. The first five books (The Torah) are written on a scroll and recited in Hebrew as a part of Jewish worship. The Torah scroll is read every day at synagogue so that the whole scroll is read within the year.</p>\n\n<p>The scripture of Christianity is the Bible, including the Old Testament (the Hebrew Bible of Judaism, including the first five books, called by Christians the Pentateuch &ndash;Greek meaning five books), and the New Testament. The New Testament includes the books that describe the life and teachings of Jesus and the history of the early Church. As the titles of the parts of the Bibleindicate, it was compiled from the writings of many authors over time, as with the torah. Christians believe that it was inspired in these authors by God.&nbsp; There are 66 books in most versions of the Christian Bible.</p>\n\n<p>The scripture of Islam is the Qur&rsquo;an. It consists of 114 chapters called surahs, and over 6000 verses called ayat. Muslims believe that it was revealed to the Prophet Muhammad through the Angel Gabriel over a period of 23 years. The Qur&rsquo;an describes and affirms the basic spiritual and moral messages of the Torah and the Bible. The Qur&rsquo;antext states that it is a continuation of God&rsquo;s message to humankind from earlier revelations.</p>\n\n<h2>The Messiah</h2>\n\n<p>Orthodox Jews believe that a Messiah is still awaited, and coming at some future time. The Reform traditiondo not expect an individual Messiah. Jewsdo not believe that Jesus was the Messiah. Some Jews believe that Jesus was a spiritual leader.</p>\n\n<p>Christians believe that Jesus was the Messiah. They also believe that Jesus was the son of God, who came to redeem human beings from sin or wrongdoing, and that he compensated for all human sins with his suffering and death. This salvation, or being saved and given eternal life, is the central teaching of the New Testament (which means promise or pledge, i.e.the salvation through Jesus)</p>\n\n<p>Muslims also believe that Jesus was the Messiah. They do not believe that he was the son of God, but a human being and Muslims also believe that God did not allow him to die or be crucified at the hands of human beings.&nbsp; Both Christians and Muslims believe that Jesus was raised up to God, but Christians believe that Jesus was raised from the dead, or resurrected. Muslims believe that Jesus was one of the greatest prophets. Muslims also share the belief with Christians in the Second Coming of Jesus Christ near the end of time.</p>\n\n<p>Among adherents of the Abrahamic faiths, only Christians and Muslims believe Jesus as a messenger of God and only Muslims believe that Muhammad was a prophet, a man who was born in Makkah in about the year 570 CE. They believe that he received the final revelation from God&mdash;the holy book called the Qur&rsquo;an. Historically, Muhammad was not accepted as a prophet by Christians and Jews. Similarly, Jews do not accept Christian or Muslim beliefs about Jesus.</p>\n\n<h2>Celebrations</h2>\n\n<p>Each of the Abrahamic faiths has a few major celebrations during the year. Both Judaism and Islam follow a lunar calendar forthe timing of these celebrations, and some Christian feast days are also influenced by the lunar calendar. Some of these celebrations are:</p>\n\n<p>&bull; Judaism &ndash;Rosh Hashanah, Yom Kippur, Passover, Shavuot, Sukkot, Chanukkah, Purim; these celebrations recall events in the dramatic history of the Jewish people.</p>\n\n<p>&bull; Christianity &ndash;Advent, Christmas, Lent, Good Friday, Easter, and Pentecost; these are only a few of the celebrations that commemorate events in the life of Jesus.</p>\n\n<p>&bull; Islam &ndash;Ramadan, Eid al-Fitr; Hajj and Eid al-Adha; Ramadan is a month of fasting commanded in the Qur&rsquo;an, and the feast day that ends it is Eid al-Fitr. Eid al-Adha and the Hajj (the ritual journey to Makkah) commemorate events in the life of Abraham and his family.There are fast days and feast days, when people deny themselves the ordinary necessities of life for a time of remembrance and thankfulness. Sharing food and other gifts with family, neighbours, and needy people are common ways to celebrate, and attending special worship services are part of these celebrations.</p>\n\n<h2>Leaders Of These Religions</h2>\n\n<p>Rabbis are the leaders in Judaism.</p>\n\n<p>Priests and Pastors of church in a hierarchical order.</p>\n\n<p>In Islam, there is no priests etc, all are equal. However the person leading prayers is called <em>Imam</em>. Leaders who offer advice on how practice Islam, on the law etc are called AH-lim (sing.) or oo-leh-MA (pl.) meaning &quot;One who has knowledge&quot;.</p>\n\n<h2>Moral and Ethical Principles and Laws</h2>\n\n<p>The most basic set of moral and ethical values in the Biblical tradition is the Ten Commandments, which was part of the revelation taught by Moses, and are revered by Jews and Christians as they appear in the Torah and the Old Testament. The Qur&rsquo;an includes all of the Ten Commandments&ndash;many of them stated in a similar way, with the exception of the Sabbath (day of rest). The Qur&rsquo;an also states that its revelation came to confirm the right messagethat the earlier prophets brought. Much of this message is the central religious concept of one God, and the basic commandments to honourparents, help the poor, respectneighbors, not to steal, kill, envy, or lie, and so on. Some of these commandments also form the basis of civil and criminal law in secular governments, and they form the basis for the concept of human rights.</p>\n\n<p>Another type of religious practice that affects how religiously diverse groups get along is rules about food. Jews and Muslims both follow dietary laws about what they can eat and how food is prepared and inparticular how animals used for meat isslaughtered and prepared. Christians do not follow either the very detailed laws about food ofthe Jews, nor do they follow the laws in Islam that forbid eating pork and drinking alcoholic beverages. Christians and Muslims do share food in social settings;however Orthodox Jews could/would not eat food prepared in a Christian/ Muslim kitchen. Christian and Muslims could share Jewish food.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portal:Religion/Did_you_know\" target=\"_blank\">Wikipedia Portal Religion: Did You Know</a></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h2>&nbsp;</h2>\n\n<p>.....
