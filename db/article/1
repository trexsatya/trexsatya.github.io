The most complete was M.W Weber&#39;s theory which included both electrostatic and electromagnetic phenomena. However in that theory, it&#39;s necessary to assume that the force b/w two electric particles depends on their relative velocity as well as on their distance.</p>\n\n<p>But it&#39;s not mechanical, there&#39;s no explanation of how particles can act at distance. So Maxwell proposes another theory.</p>\n\n<p>How is this force working? - By interaction of&nbsp;actions/motions going on in surrounding medium as well as in excited bodies. Electromagnetic field is that part of space which contains and surrounds bodies in electric or magnetic state.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>What is this space filled with? - Anything, maybe even empty of all gross matter. However, not completely empty. But we can observe that when transparent bodies of measurable densities are replaced by so-called vaccum, the transmission of radiations is not much altered. So, it must be that undulations of light/heat are those of aetherial medium instead of gross matter.</p>\n\n<p>So, if it is not completely empty, how much (gross) matter does it contain?&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>We observe that when heat leaves the source body, and the other body gets heated, in between the energy must be half in form of motion of medium and half in form of elastic resilience [W. Thomson&#39;s &quot;On Possible Density of the Luminiferous Medium...&quot;]. So, the density must be comparable to that of gross matter. Thomson even assigned a lower limit to the density of this medium.</p>\n\n<p>So, in this medium, motion of one part causes motion in another part. The parts are connected, and these connections must have some elastic yielding, otherwise communication would have been instantaneous.</p>\n\n<p>We can see it in form of two types of energies, &quot;actual&quot; and &quot;potential&quot;, and the propagation of undulations of heat/light consists in continual transformation of one of these forms of energy into other alternatively.</p>\n\n<p>Faraday Effect was already known:&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"font-size:9px;\">Diamagnetic: Things which get little bit of magnetism in presence of external magnetic field. The tend to repulse the external magnet. Paramagnetic: Similar to diamagnetic, but instead of getting repulsive, they get attracted to external magnet.&nbsp;</span>When a plane polarized ray traverses a transparent diamagnetic medium in the direction of the lines of magnetic force produced by magnets or currents in the neighborhood, the plane of polarization is caused to rotate.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>The rotation of polarized ray is in direction in which positive electricity must be carried round the diamagnetic body in order produce the actual magnetization of the field. However, if the diamagnetic body is substituted for a paramagnetic one, the direction of rotation reverses. [M Verdet&#39;s Comtes Rendus]</p>\n\n<p>So, how do we explain this?</p>\n\n<p>W. Thomson pointed that we have to assume the existence of a motion in the medium depending on the magnetization, in addition to the vibratory motion which constitutes light.</p>\n\n<p>Is it fair to assume the motion of ethereal medium?</p>\n\n<p>Although the rotation of magnetism has been of plane of polarization has been observed only in media of considerable density, but the properties of magnetic field are not so much altered by the substituting media with another medium, or by &quot;vaccum&quot;. So, it&#39;s fair to inquire &quot;can there be a motion of ethereal medium going on wherever magnetic effects are observed&quot;, and we have some reason to suppose that this motion is actually rotation, having the direction of magnetic force as its axis.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Another observation is of what&#39;s called <strong>Electromotive Force</strong>:</p>\n\n<p>When a body is moved across the lines of magnetic force, current is produced in the body. When EMF is removed, a counter current is produced and the body is restored to its original electrical state. When strong enough, such force can decompose certain compunds and move their components&nbsp;towards opposite ends. A third state is when neither current is generated, nor the body is decomposed but opposite extremeties of the body are oppositely electrified, as long as EMF is active.</p>\n\n<p>So, how does it happen?</p>\n\n<p>In a Dielectric body, molecules&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n", "authorId": 1, "subject": "natural-science", "tags": [], "img": "", "summary": "", "lastUpdated": "2021-07-04 23:07:37.377493"}
