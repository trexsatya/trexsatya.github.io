This is dishonest, but what&#39;s sinister is the cumulative effect that such dishonesty has on us: since it offers a perfect facsimile or simulacrum of goodwill without goodwill&#39;s real spirit, it messes with our heads and eventually starts upping our defenses even in cases of genuine smiles and real art and true goodwill. It makes us feel confused and lonely and impotent and angry and scared. It causes despair.&nbsp; - David Foster Wallace</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/150224-style-is-the-answer-to-everything-a-fresh-way-to\" target=\"_blank\">Bukowski&#39;s Style</a></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.poemhunter.com/poem/the-shoelace/\" target=\"_blank\">Its not the large things that send a man to a madhouse...its the continuing series of small tragedies.</a> - Bukowski</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Find What You Love And Let It Kill You - Bukowski</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>&quot;Whoever wants to live well (<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eudaimonia\" title=\"Eudaimonia\">eudaimonia</a>) must consider these three questions: First, how are&nbsp;<i>pragmata</i>&nbsp;(ethical matters, affairs, topics) by nature? Secondly, what attitude should we adopt towards them? Thirdly, what will be the outcome for those who have this attitude?&quot; Pyrrho&#39;s answer is that &quot;As for&nbsp;<i>pragmata</i>&nbsp;they are all&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adiaphora\" title=\"Adiaphora\">adiaphora</a>&nbsp;(undifferentiated by a logical differentia),&nbsp;<i>astathmēta</i>&nbsp;(unstable, unbalanced, not measurable), and&nbsp;<i>anepikrita</i>&nbsp;(unjudged, unfixed, undecidable). Therefore, neither our sense-perceptions nor our&nbsp;<i>doxai</i>&nbsp;(views, theories, beliefs) tell us the truth or lie; so we certainly should not rely on them. Rather, we should be&nbsp;<i>adoxastoi</i>&nbsp;(without views),&nbsp;<i>aklineis</i>&nbsp;(uninclined toward this side or that), and&nbsp;<i>akradantoi</i>&nbsp;(unwavering in our refusal to choose), saying about every single one that it no more is than it is not or it both is and is not or it neither is nor is not.</p>\n\n<p style=\"margin-left: 480px;\"><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pyrrho\" title=\"Pyrrho\">Pyrrho</a></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>References:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.gutenberg.org/files/58585/58585-h/58585-h.htm#link15\" target=\"_blank\">Kahlil Gibran&#39;s The Prophet</a></p>\n\n<h2>Skepticism, Criticism&nbsp; of human affairs</h2>\n\n<p>The&nbsp;most prominent of critics of &quot;normal&quot; and &quot;virtuous&quot; affairs of humans are:&nbsp;La Rochefoucauld, Friedrich Nietzsche, and Pascal.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Their critique seems to be depressive and pessimist, but they probably contain more truth than anything else.</p>\n\n<p>Rochefoucauld on passions, virtues etc</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Nietzsche on truth, virtue etc</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Pascal on natural miserable human condition etc</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n","authorId":null,"subject":"philosophy","tags":null,"img":"/images/philosophy.jpg","summary":"See some of the finest quotes on Love, Politics, Education, Knowledge, Life which stand valid in all (or most) contexts.","lastUpdated":"2020-06-13T07:39:19.034+0000"}
