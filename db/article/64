They quite literally can&rsquo;t mean what they say, quite literally. And if you notice in many traditions, the attempt to communicate through a parable is the attempt to communicate a truth that, as it were, could not possibly be communicated in another, sort of, more linear form without, as it were, the aid of a story. E.g. Christ uses parables in New Testament.</p>\n\n<p>And perhaps it&rsquo;s because the tradition of the parable is one in which the listener is forced to tap into their own autonomy and their own self creation in order to engage the parable at all.</p>\n\n<p>There is a sociological dimension to the Death of God parable. And by that I mean that the Death of God &ndash; for Nietzsche &ndash; is a trope, or a metaphor that signals some perhaps still on its way &ndash; you noticed? If you listened to the parable carefully &ndash; perhaps still on its way event. One that has still&hellip; it&rsquo;s already happened, but it&rsquo;s still on its way in the sense that it is yet to become understood in all its dimensions, in its fullness.</p>\n\n<p>Weber&rsquo;s point was that religion, when it became one compartment of life. And the best way to understand that in modern society is there are five days when you work, and there is a day where you play, there&rsquo;s a day where you have to do jury duty, a day when you have to vote, and then a day to go to church, and our lives become, as it were, fragmented and compartmentalised into these spheres. As that happened &ndash; which Weber saw as a process of secularisation &ndash; as religion became, as it were, shrunken to this one day a week observance, okay. This is sort of regardless of individuals. You could feel like you are doing it every day but it&rsquo;s awfully hard, as I think a rather minor rock&rsquo;n&rsquo;roll star said &ldquo;It&rsquo;s awfully hard to be a saint in the city&rdquo;. It&rsquo;s very difficult to be a Christian under those cultural and social conditions.</p>\n\n<p>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/It%27s_Hard_to_Be_a_Saint_in_the_City</p>\n\n<p>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean_Streets</p>\n\n<p>Better than Bruce Springsteen&rsquo;s &ldquo;<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/It%27s_Hard_to_Be_a_Saint_in_the_City\" onclick=\"_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/It%27s_Hard_to_Be_a_Saint_in_the_City', 'Saint in the City']);\">Saint in the City</a>&rdquo; is <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Scorsese\" onclick=\"_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Scorsese', 'Martin Scorseseâ€™s']);\">Martin Scorsese&rsquo;s</a> brilliant film &ldquo;<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean_Streets\" onclick=\"_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean_Streets', 'Mean Streets']);\">Mean Streets</a>&ldquo;, where one of the characters has for a hero <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint_Francis_of_Assisi\" onclick=\"_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint_Francis_of_Assisi', 'Saint Francis of Assisi']);\">Saint Francis of Assisi</a>, but what does he do? Well, he runs a little numbers, hangs out with a few minor <a href=\"http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/hoodlum\" onclick=\"_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/hoodlum', 'hoods']);\">hoods</a> and tries to get by in the city. And Scorsese wants to highlight for us this process by which this otherwise exemplary character cannot realise himself under those conditions.</p>\n\n<p>So the sociological remark is something really profound has changed in the world. Weber called it the &ldquo;disenchantment of the world&rdquo;, and even though its old fashioned to mention his name now &ndash; in the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_world_order_(politics)\" onclick=\"_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_world_order_(politics)', 'New World Order']);\">New World Order</a> &ndash; <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marx\" onclick=\"_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marx', 'Marx']);\">Marx</a> also noticed a profound change from the feudal to the capitalist mode of production.</p>\n\n<p>And he talked about the way that all fast frozen relations in feudalism, all these fixed systems of thought and enquiry &ndash; and there were systems of thought and enquiry &ndash; and world views in the medieval period were being rapidly torn asunder by the new forces of production, and the new developments and technologies under capitalism, which Marx praises in the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Communist_Manifesto\" onclick=\"_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Communist_Manifesto', 'Manifesto']);\">Manifesto</a> as being &ndash; in that regard &ndash; progressive. He says all those ancient feudal ties of blood and all these ancient feudal relations, they had to be mercilessly ripped apart, and then Marx points out correctly, they <em>were</em> mercilessly ripped apart.</p>\n\n<p>So in fact the whole tradition of sociology is born from the attempt to understand the transition that was widely felt, not just by intellectuals, but people in their ordinary lives that had occurred between one massive way of producing and organising life and another.</p>\n\n<p>Nietzsche&rsquo;s question is: &ldquo;Is your life of that kind that you would be willing to repeat it over and over again&rdquo;. Eternal Recurrence.</p>\n\n<p>This question Nietzsche finds horrifying, in part, because the world has changed in such a way, and among its changes are the everyday&hellip; And I should, I have got to mention this tension between Nietzsche and the everyday, what I called last time the, sort of, everyday boring, crappy world of the bourgeoisie. We are bought and sold on the marketplace every day. I mean that&rsquo;s where the madman goes, is to the marketplace, to give his news. You had better go to the marketplace to give your news or you won&rsquo;t get heard, right? You know.</p>\n\n<p>Nietzsche&rsquo;s challenge is more than just to change jobs from accounting to banking, to even being, sort of, the captain of a little skiff for a year on your, you know, say, on your savings or whatever. It&rsquo;s to live a life that is in some sense &ndash; and I don&rsquo;t, here I don&rsquo;t want to even &ndash; I hate to use the word &ldquo;art&rdquo;, because that trivialises it. But in a way to live a life that&rsquo;s like a work of art. Like Hamlet in a sense, that you&rsquo;d be willing to play that part again. &ldquo;Yeah I did well enough I want to play it again&rdquo;.</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;What is the best kind of life for human beings?&rdquo;. Nietzsche thinks there is no general answer to that question, but he thinks it&rsquo;s a supremely important question. But he doesn&rsquo;t&hellip; By &ldquo;general answer&rdquo;, that means there is not one answer that I can find and then I give you the argument and all of you go: &ldquo;Oh yeah, that&rsquo;s right, that&rsquo;s the best one, we&rsquo;ll all do it&rdquo;. No.</p>\n\n<p>In any case, this challenge to create oneself is a magnificent one and it bears, as I say, a striking resemblance to artistic creation, however the level of self consciousness involved is perhaps even greater.</p>\n\n<p>Another motto that grows out of this notion of The Eternal Recurrence is Nietzsche&rsquo;s motto that he was in love with fate, or loved fate. The love of fate. Because for Nietzsche there is something all so fateful about where you find yourself.</p>\n\n<p>Thinking about the great majority that toil anonymously day in and day out, it&rsquo;s hard to imagine a life worth living even the first time, not to mention twice.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Nietzsche Will To Power:</strong></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n","authorId":null,"subject":"hidden","tags":null,"img":null,"summary":null,"lastUpdated":null}
