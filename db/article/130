{"name":"Analysis of online conversations","id":130,"content":"<p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PagNM_oxssE\">Rubin Report - Eric Weinstein, Jordan Peterson, Ben Shapiro</a></p>\n\n<p>Why are these people okay with disagreements and other people are not?</p>\n\n<p>Eric - Because they are able to accept when they are wrong, as long as everyone plays in an honest fashion and to their full capacity.</p>\n\n<p>Ben - He is interested in best versions of arguments rather than <em>stupid</em> ones.</p>\n\n<p>Jordan - Such conversations make his arguments better, and arguments guide his actions, so effectively they make him better person. So, he likes to hear the best version of arguments that go against his, so that he could improve.</p>\n\n<p>Eric - Everybody in this group is non-egoistic.</p>\n\n<p>Jordan - They explore ideas with the audience, audience participates in it. Gives example of his talk with Sam Harris in Vancouver. And this is true art, going on an unknown journey like in the novels of&nbsp;<span>Dostoevsky. Gives example of Joe Rogan, he does the same thing, because he knows that there are lots of things he doesn&#39;t know, and he isn&#39;t afraid to explore those things, and that makes him successful.</span></p>\n\n<p><span>We offer interesting discussions rather than useless talks in favour or against someone like Trump.</span></p>\n\n<p><span>Ben - We are engaging in kind of a collective form of Cognitive Behavioral Therapy. Reasonings that we offer can be used in solving self-help problems as well as societal problems. Everybody is depressed but they don&#39;t know why they are depressed. People somehow know that there&#39;s crisis (of fascism for example), but they also think that the system is </span><span jsslot=\"\"><span data-dobid=\"hdw\">irrevocably broken, they are not willing to do anything, that&#39;s where we come in.</span></span></p>\n\n<p>Eric - Difers radically. Somehow the message that you should improve your own life got conflated with if your own life isn&#39;t awesome, it&#39;s because you failed to make it so, that was more true in a period of uniform high growth like 1945-1970 when hard work actually paid off. Now things are more complicated, and the message should be that even if you can&#39;t solve the whole problem, solve the portions of it. And also if more people get onboard with this idea, they should at least try to solve their own problem (or portion of problem) before demanding that someone from outside will do.</p>\n\n<p>Ben - Most of the problems that people (in America) face, are self-inflicted. Althoug, he doesn&#39;t think that all problems can be solved just because you have communal power behind it.</p>\n\n<p>Jordan - Even if (some) problems are not self-created like mental illness combined with homelessness, we don&#39;t know how to solve those, even at communal level (involvement of community).</p>\n\n<p>Ben - One problem is that people tend to incline towards Utopianism. Gives example of someone who promised Universal healthcare, universal pay,... How are you gonna bring that...</p>\n\n<p>Jordan - You need a system that has capacity to fulfil those wishes, the system that can grow.</p>\n\n<p>Ben - Free markets certainly are not Utopian. But they at least have certain degree of respect for human labour dignity and individuality, and collectivist Utopia certainly do not.</p>\n\n<p>Jordan - They also have some distributive quality. Even if a bad decision is made, they often are self-correcting and mostly they operate locally.</p>\n\n<p>Eric - After 1970s, we have seen the growth of man&#39;s median income depart from the GDP growth rate. And it is sort of a systemic problem. The problem with exponential growth obligations which appears in many places, gives examples of number of PhDs, the growth rate etc, is that it can&#39;t continue forever. And institutions still continue to lie just to keep them afloat. An example in case of law firms where associates are told that if they work hard they will become partners, in colleges students are told that if they work hard they will become professors with 20 students under them and so on.</p>\n\n<p>Jordan - Measurements are complicated. Even though man&#39;s income has not grown accordingly, man of current age is much better than past. Even if an average American is not richer, the world around him is, that&#39;s a form of accrued wealth. You are actually safer when the quarter of Chinese or Indians are not starving. Is this Local (wage) stagnation even true, we (an averge person) is certainly richer than before, in terms of access to information</p>\n\n<p>Eric - Humans are very focussed on things like status. (Eric was interrupted)</p>\n\n<p>Jordan - Perhaps in 1945-72 people weren&#39;t provided a standard of living higher than we have now, but a trajectory of development that appeared more stable and believable [Eric - and low variance]. What do you actually want, that sort of stable trajectory or higher standard of living?</p>\n\n<p>Eric - I want predictability, like I should be able to make 30 year plan for my retirement etc.</p>\n\n<p>Ben - The problem seems to be that even though the change in system and technology is unpredictable, but if someone feels worse off because someone else is earning more even though he has more than what he had five years ago, is lack of basic morality. So, people should control their reactions to the change, if they can&#39;t control the change itself.</p>\n\n<p>Jordan - How do we tolerate all these changes given that we are also deriving substantial benefit from it, we don&#39;t mess it up. You do that by getting your act together as much as you can, so that you are prepared for anything and everything that comes.</p>\n\n<p>Eric - The idea that personal responsibility is something that we need, and also something that we can&#39;t have is too dangerous. If the money is so important, which it is now, then people should not be given message like &quot;Be a good person and work hard&quot; A lot of this doesn&#39;t work the way it used to, and lying about it offends Eric.</p>\n\n<p>Jordan - If you take control of your own life, then you can make a stronger case against systemic failures. Right says that &quot;well if you just get your act together you can make it&quot; and the left tends to think that &quot;everybody is same and if you remove systemic impediments then everybody could do what they needed to do&quot;. Both of them are wrong, left is wrong because there&#39;s real difference in IQ and effect of IQ is real. Psychometric data suggests that if you have IQ less than 90 (that is about 15 percent of the population), you have hard time following the instruction. You might think that we can change that with education, but the evidence for that working is very slim. So even if the society is meritocratic, it&#39;s gonna produce unequal outcomes.</p>\n\n<p>Eric - The thing that he doesn&#39;t like about personal responsibility issues is that individuals should not be solving the problems of let&#39;s say tech groups getting together and say we will not poach each other&#39;s employees. The market has to work for people not just institutions. And if you are in a sector in which you can make market work for you, you have this feeling that anybody can do this, and in fact what you need to do is that you need to migrate into these sectors. So a lot of high IQ smart people find themselves fighting forces which they don&#39;t even understand [and shouldn&#39;t be fighting]. When you have bad behavior by institutions, it is pathological to put that responsibility on individuals&#39; shoulders. Gives example of Len Bolle who saw a disaster (2008 crisis) coming and got involved with Banks&#39; game.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>More to read: <a href=\"https://medium.com/@kevinshau/on-anthropic-capitalism-a-response-to-eric-weinstein-1153b55777b5\">https://medium.com/@kevinshau/on-anthropic-capitalism-a-response-to-eric-weinstein-1153b55777b5</a></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n","authorId":null,"subject":"philosophy","tags":null,"img":null,"summary":null,"lastUpdated":"2020-06-21T18:06:42.329+0000"}
