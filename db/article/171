{"name":"The Limitations Of Human Mind","id":171,"content":"<p><span style=\"color:#8e44ad;font-size:20px;font-family:Condiment;letter-spacing: 2.5;\">We rely heavily on our senses and the human sensors&nbsp;are most sophisticated by design, but still its easy to fool any of them because of the way the mind works.</span></p>\n\n<p>The human body is a very sophisticated system.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;From Wikipedia:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p><cite>&nbsp;</cite>The human eye can differentiate between about 10 million colors<sup id=\"cite_ref-business_1-0\"><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_eye#cite_note-business-1\">[1]</a></sup>&nbsp;and is possibly capable of detecting a single&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photon\" title=\"Photon\">photon</a>.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>But still human mind is limited, it cannot focus for a very long time, it cannot focus on all the things in front of it (See some tests which confirm this: <u><a href=\"https://youtu.be/nJyWIghprxI\" target=\"_blank\">Selective Attention Tests</a> </u>).&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Our brain creates abstractions of everything. It creates an abstraction of ideas (i.e. Concepts), it creates an abstraction of the world around us, it creates an abstraction of future (expectations), and processes the incoming information in these&nbsp;realms of abstractions.</p>\n\n<p>Our senses are not completely reliable. For example, we have a clear understanding of the concept of length, size, and color but still, our mind is fooled in some situations. See these videos for a demo: <u><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7efEqgpIrE\" target=\"_blank\">Optical Illusions About Space (dimensions), Size, and Colors</a></u></p>\n\n<p>According to <u>estimations</u>,&nbsp;vision is so important for primates and people, that when people estimate how much of the neocortex is devoted to different modalities, a common estimate is that <strong>about half of the brain</strong> is primarily devoted to vision-- 11% to touch, 3% to audition.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>About half of the brain is devoted to vision and yet it drives away from reality in many cases, as observed in these illusions:</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#8e44ad;\"><strong>The point is, if half of the brain power is not able to show (with 100% reliability) even the physical reality, then think what about the abstract concepts that we humans have created like: nation, money, status and&nbsp;maybe god; how easily our brain can be driven towards illusions.</strong></span></p>\n\n<p>Take this illusion (known as Ebbinghaus illusion) for example:&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"http://michaelpawlicki.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/Ebbinghaus-Illusion.jpg\" style=\"width: 500px; height: 167px; float: left;\" />&nbsp;The two circles are exactly identical in REALITY. But they appear to be different in size because of their surroundings. Apply this illusion to the social status (an abstract concept) that people talk about.</p>\n\n<p>When reality comes, the two people who suppose to be having different status turn out to be the same.</p>\n\n<p>Is it not possible that when you consider someone inferior to you, you actually are in an illusion?</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p style=\"margin-left: 280px;\"><img alt=\"\" dir=\"rtl\" src=\"https://i.pinimg.com/originals/59/8b/cf/598bcf74a5b6c4931902b8e467620a4c.jpg\" style=\"width: 300px; height: 200px;\" /></p>\n\n<p style=\"margin-left: 160px;\">&nbsp;All the dots are white in this image, but still, your mind thinks some of them are black/dark.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p style=\"margin-left: 160px;\">Is it not possible that when you differentiate people based on color, caste; you are missing the point that they all are same, it&#39;s just your perception?</p>\n\n<p><br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d2/Caf%C3%A9_wall.svg/1200px-Caf%C3%A9_wall.svg.png\" style=\"width: 300px; height: 193px;\" />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>\n\n<p style=\"margin-left: 120px;\">&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p style=\"margin-left: 120px;\">Believe it or not, there are only straight lines in this image.</p>\n\n<p style=\"margin-left: 120px;\">So, is it not possible that life is straight and you are perceiving it in a zig-zag fashion, and that life is so simple, but we perceive it differently?</p>\n\n<p style=\"margin-left: 120px;\">&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Let&#39;s see how you are constantly being manipulated by the outside world:</p>\n\n<p>Do you see anything in the below picture?</p>\n\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/brain-and-cognitive-sciences/9-00sc-introduction-to-psychology-fall-2011/vision-ii/discussion-vision/Expectations-Changing-Perce.jpg\" style=\"width: 290px; height: 216px;\" /></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>What???
