{"name":"Interpersonal Psychology","id":219,"content":"<div class=\"box1\">\n<p>Interpersonal Communication.</p>\n\n<p>Why/how do two people build a rapport? Why do we like someone, why do we not like someone? How to make someone talk about themselves?<br />\nYou think you only talk/communicate by speaking?</p>\n</div>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Such questions have been studied in pseudo-scientific way for many years. There are theories, courses, principles etc.. The implications are everywhere: in mating, in social life, in business (especially sales and marketing), in education etc.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuro-linguistic_programming\" target=\"_blank\">Neuro-Linguistic Programming</a>:</p>\n\n<p>It is an observable fact that physiology and psychology are interrelated. <em>Notice that when you are happy you automatically tend to smile more, and notice that if you force yourself to smile or someone does something that forces you to smile you automatically become happy.</em></p>\n\n<p>Our brain resists what people tells us, not what it concludes is true. <em>(This is basically Cognitive Dissonance)</em></p>\n\n<p>This fact can be used to get someone to agree with you, or to make someone like you or believe you. You just have to frame what you are saying in a way that the conflict with their mental model of the world is minimized.</p>\n\n<p>Also, remember whatever gets in person&#39;s memory first has most influence consciously or subconsciously, that is the frame of reference. Like you see the world as per the context that was set up during your childhood.</p>\n\n<p>When you try to persuade someone or present yourself to someone, there are 3 categories of resistance that come into play:</p>\n\n<ol>\n\t<li>How we see ourselves</li>\n\t<li>How we think others see us</li>\n\t<li>What we think to be true</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Everybody has some defence mechanism. You have to sneak into that mechanism.</p>\n\n<p>Just like physical resistance, when someone tries to push, your body automatically pulls, and vice-versa; psychological self also does the same thing.</p>\n\n<p>Object-Relation Theory:<br />\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Your brain is influenced by the objects all around.<br />\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;So in case of Hypnosis, you are also part of the context when you are interacting with someone else. To control them you have to control yourself as well. &quot;Who do you have to be yourself to make them be what you want them to be, so that they do what you want them to do&quot;</p>\n\n<p>Physiology (posture, breathing rate) &lt;--&gt; Emotion<br />\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;It is easier to affect the mind using body, however vice-versa is also possible.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And it&#39;s not even just about you, your physiology can affect their emotion, their emotion can affect your physiology, your emotions can affect their physiology and emotion etc.</p>\n\n<p>Matching v/s Mirroring<br />\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Matching for example A puts up left hand, you also put left hand. Mirroring will be if you put up right hand.</p>\n\n<p>When you have a rapport with someone Mirroring/Matching can naturally occur. When you Mirror/Match a rapport might create.</p>\n\n<p>Are you worried that NLP is like faking, that this is like unnatural?</p>\n\n<p><strong>Difference b/w Natural and Learned?</strong></p>\n\n<p>4 Stages of learning:<br />\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;1. We don&#39;t know that we don&#39;t know<br />\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;2. We know that we don&#39;t know<br />\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;(Here Cognitive Dissonance occurs)<br />\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;3. We know how to do it<br />\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;4. It becomes like breathing, we don&#39;t know how we do it (or it doesn&#39;t matter)</p>\n\n<p>At the 4th stage, it becomes Natural. Afterall</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>&quot;What are our natural principles but principles of custom?&quot;&nbsp; - Pascal</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injection_locking#Entrainment\" target=\"_blank\">Law of Entrainment</a><br />\nmay also works on psychological level</p>\n\n<h2>3 Magic Question</h2>\n\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1. Location/Occasion (Generates attraction, Elicits information) Ask open-end questions like &quot;What brought you here (to this location/occasion)?&quot;<br />\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;2. Career, Passion, ....<br />\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;How do you get somebody to talk more about them, by giving them cue words/concepts which are part of their self.<br />\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;How do you get those cue words? =&gt; By midful listening to them. Their words, their gestures, pauses, tones, .....</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;3. Past pleasant childhood experiences</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;All of it must not sound like Interrogation (to which people will be reluctant). You need to soften it.</p>\n\n<p><br />\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Most of us are in Internal, Dissociative state (inside our head, not linked to surrounding). We need reverse of it for establishing a rapport.</p>\n\n<p>Sometimes people will disagree with you (or they would think so) even though you are both saying the same thing. You must use their exact words to give them back.</p>\n\n<p>It&#39;s not about what you say, it&#39;s about how you say it.</p>\n\n<p>If a woman is not interested in interaction (not sexual but any interaction at all), she will systematically remove you from her environment (even in an elevator)<br />\nAny kind of attention from woman is an invitation to interact (not an invitation to sex).<br />\nWoman what they think is obvious sign, is normally subtle for the men. And men, what they think is subtle sign for woman is actually &#39;in your face&#39;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n","authorId":null,"subject":"psychology","tags":null,"img":null,"summary":"","lastUpdated":null}
