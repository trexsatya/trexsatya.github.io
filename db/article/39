{"name":"Automate Your Builds With Jenkins","id":39,"content":"<h2>Objective</h2>\n\n<p>Suppose you have created a project and put it in a Git repository. Now whenever you make changes to the project, you want to deploy it on the server and perform testing on it, and release it to the customers. But there are lots of steps involved in this, so it is wise to automate this process. That&#39;s what&nbsp;<em><strong>continuous delivery</strong> pipeline</em>&nbsp;is for.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Jenkins has made a lot of progress recently, its functionalities and UI have improved a lot.</p>\n\n<p>We will see how can we use Jenkins to setup&nbsp;<em><strong>continuous delivery</strong> pipeline.</em>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Place a&nbsp;<em>Jenkinsfile</em> in the root folder of your project in the git repository.</p>\n\n<p>An example of Jenkins file for a Java project.</p>\n\n<pre>\n<code class=\"language-python\">pipeline {\n    agent { docker { image 'maven:3.3.3' } }\n    stages {\n        stage('build') {\n            steps {\n                sh 'mvn --version'\n            }\n        }\n    }\n}</code></pre>\n\n<p>Create a new item on the Jenkins dashboard. Visit this documentation which explains the process.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://jenkins.io/doc/pipeline/tour/hello-world/\" target=\"_blank\">https://jenkins.io/doc/pipeline/tour/hello-world/</a></p>\n\n<p>Jenkins is a cluster based system, you can have multiple Jenkins agents running. These agents checkout the source code from Git repository into a &quot;<em>Workspace&quot;</em> folder, run the actual steps in the pipeline.</p>\n\n<p>Inside Jenkins file you can declare which commands to retry if they fail, and specify timeout, handle success, failure of the steps.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://jenkins.io/doc/pipeline/tour/running-multiple-steps/\" target=\"_blank\">https://jenkins.io/doc/pipeline/tour/running-multiple-steps/</a></p>\n\n<p>You can also publish test results. Publish generated artifacts (e.g. JAR) to an artifactory repository.</p>\n\n<p>You can add a step for deployment, and also ask for human input in the step if required e.g. to ask whether test results look good enough to continue deployment.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n","authorId":null,"subject":"devops","tags":["basic"],"img":"/images/teamcity.png","summary":"","lastUpdated":"2020-05-10T17:02:00.472+0000"}
