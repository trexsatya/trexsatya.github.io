What does it mean to have &quot;life&quot;?</li>\n\t<li>Are these three related: Life, Consciousness, Intelligence?</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n\n<p><br />\nOkay, we know robots are created by us, we have seen them create it (using metals, softwares etc). But what if the robot is created using substances that we don&#39;t know about; and it acts, behaves, reacts just like dog-like animals. Does it have a life? Or, what if robot is created using something that looks exactly like flesh and bone?</p>\n\n<p>Okay, you say that it does not have life because it doesn&#39;t make children. What if it can somehow replicate, not exactly in a sexual way, but somehow it is able to replicate. <em>(Many animals replicate in non-sexual way)</em>. What then, does it have life?</p>\n\n<p>What if the robot is made of something that is exactly like flesh, bone and blood etc with same anatomy as people have, acts and reacts like people do, can learn a few things, talk to you, can laugh, cry, smile etc, can replicate in the same way as people do. Does it have a life?</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#0066cc;\">If the answer to the above question is yes, then what&#39;s the difference between such life-like robots and people that you interact with in your life?</span></p>\n\n<h3>&nbsp;</h3>\n\n<h3>Consciousness</h3>\n\n<p>I sense something, feel something, experience something and I&#39;m aware of it and I&#39;m aware that I&#39;m aware of the awareness itself. By looking at others&#39; actions and reactions which are similar to mine I conclude that they are also capable of doing all these things.</p>\n\n<p>But how would I be sure that they are also experiencing something (and more precisely the same things that I experience), that they also feel same things, and they are also aware of it? Just by looking at the actions, reactions?</p>\n\n<p>What if in future, we are able to create robots which can display emotions, and seem like they are experiencing, they communicate with us, make conversations about feelings, experiences etc.. but since we are the creators of robots we know that they are different. Are they also conscious like us?</p>\n\n<p>What are you aware of? Just the things that you gather by senses? What about memories? What about narratives of consciousness communicated in verbal or non-verbal ways from others (second person, third person)?</p>\n\n<p><strong>The Problem of Consciousness:</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>The Descriptive Question: <em>What</em> is consciousness? What are its principal features? And by what means can they be best discovered, described and modeled?</li>\n\t<li>The Explanatory Question: <em>How</em> does consciousness of the relevant sort come to exist? Is it a primitive aspect of reality, and if not how does (or could) consciousness in the relevant respect arise from or be caused by nonconscious entities or processes?</li>\n\t<li>The Functional Question: <em>Why</em> does consciousness of the relevant sort exist? Does it have a function, and if so what is it? Does it act causally and if so with what sorts of effects? Does it make a difference to the operation of systems in which it is present, and if so why and how?</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>These are inter-dependent questions.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h2>Concepts of Consciousness</h2>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>Creature Consciousness</strong></p>\n\n<hr />\n<p>Does every creature (natural or artificial) which can sense and react (<em>sentients</em>) have some degree of consciousness? If yes, what sort of senses make something conscious? Is a fish conscious? What about bees, shrimps?</p>\n\n<p>When one&#39;s asleep, when one&#39;s dreaming, when one&#39;s hallucinating, when one&#39;s in coma, when one is hypnotized is he conscious in these stages? <em>(What about when one is under someone else&#39;s control by whatever means?)</em></p>\n\n<p>Granted that animals (other than humans) are conscious, are they self-conscious? That is, are they aware of their consciousness? Even in case of humans, are all humans conscious in this sense?</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>State Consciousness</strong></p>\n\n<hr />\n<p>Are you aware of your mental states? Do you know when you are angry? Do you know when you feel beauty, love?</p>\n\n<p>What about you love when you love it? What about you angry about your anger? <span style=\"color:#0066cc;\"><em>Meta-mentality, Meta-intentionality</em></span>.</p>\n\n<p>What about that feeling, taste when you drink that tea or coffee? <span style=\"color:#0066cc;\"><em>Qualia</em></span>.</p>\n\n<p>What about awareness of space, time, organization of the world in general? <span style=\"color:#0066cc;\"><em>Phenomenal</em></span></p>\n\n<p>You basically see something and it invokes some memories, thoughts, etc. One invocation leads to another. So if a machine that is accessing/navigating data in this format (suppose the interactions, connections is rich enough), is that machine conscious? Is there consciousness because of these connections, or are there connections because we have consciousness? Afterall, these links are hidden, even <s>if they are in memory</s>, if we are not aware of it.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h2>How Life, Mind, Intelligence Emerges</h2>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#0000cc;\">Can Life, Consciousness, Intelligence emerge out of purely physical things like atoms and molecules?</span></p>\n\n<p>See this <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Njuso5A2jts\" target=\"_blank\">podcast</a>. The theory in basic form is this: Random soup of chemicals on earth, out of randomness some pattern occurs, but patterns happen to be sustainable, once a pattern arises there is some kind of information stored in the context, which makes the replication of pattern possible, and not only the pattern can be replicated then, it can introduce slight complexity during replication. Once we reach the stage where we have DNA for the storage mechanism, single-cell organism, then Theory of Evolution works further for the genesis of complex organisms.</p>\n\n<p>.....</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#0000cc;\">Or, are there any purely physical things at all? How are we so sure that atoms and molecules are purely physical?</span></p>\n\n<p>.....</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#0033cc;\">Why did any entity (although we are convinced that only humans do this) start thinking? And we know that thinking is what led to intelligence.</span></p>\n\n<p>Can the answer of this &#39;why&#39; be captured in any mathematical equation? Or can we simulate this somehow?&nbsp;- If yes, then we, definitely, can create intelligence.</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#000099;\">Consciousness manifests itself as life or life manifests consciousness?</span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#000099;\">Consciousness is the cause of things or consciousness emerges from arrangement of things? Or, are both consciousness and matter caused by something else?</span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#000099;\">How did the first mental event arise/emerge?</span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#000099;\">If consiousness emerges from an arrangement of matter, then does consciousness end when the arrangement is disintegrated (i.e. when the body dies)? Is it destroyed completely, or does something survive?</span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#0000cc;\">If one form of arrangement creates one form of life, can other forms of life exist? What would they be?</span></p>\n\n<p>If the consciousness runs as a stream, a cycle of cause and effect, is <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nirvana\" target=\"_blank\">Nirvana</a> even possible? Buddhists say yes, if you remove all the karmic memory, but where does this karmic memory get stored anyway, and as long as you exist in any possible way, how is it possible to not leave karmic imprints?</p>\n\n<p>If someone claims to have seen their past lives through <span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Parapsychological_evidence\">Parapsychological events, can we eliminate the possibility that it&#39;s not just a mental formation?</span></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<hr />\n<h2>Alan Turing&#39;s Paper: Computing Machinery and Intelligence</h2>\n\n<p>Can Machines Think? Two terms are involved here. These terms are ambiguous, so I will rephrase the question.</p>\n\n<p>The problem is now represented in the form of a game (Imitation Game): It is played with three people a man (A), a woman (B), and an interrogator (C) who may be of either sex. The interrogator stays in the room apart from the other two. The object of the interrogator is to determine which of the other two is man, and which is the woman. The interrogator is allowed to put questions to A and B thus:</p>\n\n<p>Will X please tell me the length of his or her hair? Now suppose X is actually A, then A must answer. It is A&#39;s object in the game to try and cause C to make the wrong identification. His answer might therefore be: &#39;My hair is shingled, and longest strands are about nine inches long&#39;. The answers must be typewritten so to not give away by tone or handwriting patterns. <em>[Or just remove the immediate give-away anyhow.]</em></p>\n\n<p>The object of the game for the third player B is to help the interrogator. The best strategy for her is to probably give truthful answers. She can add such things as &#39;I am the woman, don&#39;t listen to him!&#39; to her answers, but it will avail nothing as the man can make the similar remarks.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>We now ask the question, &#39;What will happen when a machine takes part of A in this game?&#39; Will the interrogator decide wrongly as often as when the game is played like this as he does when the game is played between man and woman?</p>\n\n<p>Is this question even worthwhile?</p>\n\n<p>Yes, the new problem has advantage of drawing a fairly sharp line between the physical and the intellectual capacities of a man.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><em>[Any question can be asked. The machine has the objective to answer as much humanly as possible]</em></p>\n\n<p>It can also be rephrased as &quot;Are there imaginable digital computers which can do well in the imitation game&quot;?</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Are there discrete machines which will do well?&quot; (in more general sense)</p>\n\n<p>I believe in about 50 yrs time <em>[this was in 1950]</em> it will be possible to programme computers to make them play the imitation game so well that an average interrogator will not have more than 70% chance of making the right identification after 5 minutes of questioning. The original question, &#39;Can machines think?&#39; I believe to be too meaningless to deserve discussion. Nevertheless I believe that at the end of the century the use of words and general educated opinion will have altered so much that one will be able to speak of machines thinking without expecting to be contradicted.</p>\n\n<p>Turing considers following arguments in his paper:</p>\n\n<ol>\n\t<li><span style=\"color:#0066cc;\">Theological objections</span>:<br />\n\tGod created humans different from animals. Only humans have thinking capability, no machines or animals can have it.<br />\n\t<em>Why believe that God has no further plan?</em><br />\n\t&nbsp;</li>\n\t<li><span style=\"color:#0066cc;\">The Heads in The Sand objection:</span><br />\n\tConsequences of machines being able to think will be dreadful. Let us hope and believe that they cannot do so.<br />\n\t<em>Why is that? Is it because men do not want to lose their superiority?</em><br />\n\t&nbsp;</li>\n\t<li><span style=\"color:#0066cc;\">The mathematical objections:</span><br />\n\tMathematical logic system tells us that there are limitations to the powers of discrete-state machines.&nbsp;G&ouml;del&#39;s theorem, Church-Turing thesis show us that. Specifically the kind of questions they cannot answer is this: &quot;Consider the machine specified as follows.... Will this machine ever answer &#39;Yes&#39; to any question?&quot;<br />\n\tBut it&#39;s not that all machines will not be able to answer particualr question. There might be other machines which are able to answer it. It&#39;s the same thing with humans. Also there is no proof that there are no questions that humans are unable to answer.<br />\n\t&nbsp;</li>\n\t<li><span style=\"color:#0066cc;\">The Argument from Consciousness:</span><br />\n\t&quot;Not until a machine can write a sonnet or compose a concerto because of thoughts and emotions felt, and not by the chance fall of symbols, could we agree that machines equals brain - i.e. not only write but know that it had written it. No mechanism could feel (and not merely artificially signal, an easy contrivance) pleasure at its successes, grieves when its valves fuse, be warmed by flattery, be made miserable by its mistakes, be charmed by sex, be angry of get depressed when it cannot get what it wants&quot;<br />\n\t<br />\n\t<em>Then only way to know whether a machine thinks is to be the machine and feel oneself thinking.&nbsp;<br />\n\tHow do you even know that other people are thinking?</em><br />\n\t&nbsp;</li>\n\t<li><span style=\"color:#0066cc;\">Argument from various disabilities:</span><br />\n\tA machine will never be able to do things like: &#39;be kind, resourceful, friendly&#39;, &#39;tell right from wrong&#39;, &#39;make someone fall in love with it&#39;, &#39;learn from experience&#39;, &#39;use words properly&#39;, &#39;be the subject of its own thought&#39;, &#39;do something really new&#39;, &#39;have as much diversity as man&#39;,... Most of these objections are disguised arguments from Consciousness.<br />\n\t<br />\n\t<em>Why is that? Just because so far we have not seen machines do that?</em>&nbsp;<br />\n\t&nbsp;</li>\n\t<li><span style=\"color:#0066cc;\">Lady Lovelace&#39;s objection:</span><br />\n\tCharles Babbage&#39;s Analytical Engine was a kind of universal machine. Lady Lovelace writes &quot;The Analytical Engine has no pretensions to <em>originate</em> anything. It can do <em>whatever we know how to</em> order it to perform&quot;.<br />\n\t<br />\n\tThis does not imply that it may not be possible to construct electronic equipment which will &#39;think for itself&#39;, or in which, in biological terms, one could setup a conditioned reflex, which would serve as a basis for learning.<br />\n\t<br />\n\tThis can be rephrased as &#39;machines can never do anything really new&#39; or &#39;a machine can never take us by surprise&#39;.<br />\n\t<br />\n\t<em>Really, why? How does anyone arrive at any conception? Is it not from older ideas? What is new? Is it not result from growth of some seed sown by a teacher or by following some general principles? Is it not because of a fallacy which is the assumption that as soon as fact is presented to a mind, all consequences of that fact spring into the mind simultaneously?</em><br />\n\t&nbsp;</li>\n\t<li><span style=\"color:#0066cc;\">Argument from the Continuity in the Nervous System:</span><br />\n\tThe nervous system is not a discrete-state machine, hence the outcome/capabilities&nbsp;of a discrete-state machine must be different.<br />\n\t<br />\n\t<em>But it does not help interrogator in this imitation game.&nbsp;</em><br />\n\t&nbsp;</li>\n\t<li><span style=\"color:#0066cc;\">Argument from Informality of Behavior:</span><br />\n\tIt is not possible to produce a set of rules puporting to describe what a man should do in every conceivable set of circumstances. Otherwise man would just become a machine.<br />\n\t<br />\n\t<em>When do we know that there are no such rules?</em><br />\n\t&nbsp;</li>\n\t<li><span style=\"color:#0066cc;\">Argument from Extra-Sensory Perception:</span><br />\n\tTelepathy, Clairvoyance, Precognition, and Psycho-Kinesis.&nbsp;<br />\n\tThese phenomena defy all our scientific ideas.<br />\n\t<br />\n\tHowever the idea of telepathy weakens the efficiency&nbsp;of this game, a telepathy-proof room would satisfy all requirements.<br />\n\t&nbsp;</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n","authorId":null,"subject":"philosophy","tags":null,"img":null,"summary":"Is it possible to create human-like intelligence, consciousness and artificial life?
