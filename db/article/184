This is seen in most of the organisms.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h2>Basic Form of Animal Intelligence:</h2>\n\n<p>(Intelligence revolving around the individual benefit of the animal)</p>\n\n<p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\"><strong>Goal Oriented Intelligence: (Driven by survival instincts)</strong></p>\n\n<p style=\"margin-left: 80px;\">Ex. there is a monkey [who is hungry], there is a ladder, there is a table, there are bananas hanging on the ceiling.&nbsp;<br />\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;All the conscious (<em>partially or fully</em>) efforts that bring the&nbsp;monkey&nbsp;closer to the banana exhibits &quot;intelligence&quot;.</p>\n\n<p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\"><strong>Experimental (playful?) Intelligence: (Driven by experiments of the actor)</strong></p>\n\n<p style=\"margin-left: 80px;\">Ex. there is a monkey [who is not hungry], there is a rope, there is a ladder, there is a table, there are bananas hanging on the ceiling.<br />\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Monkey has no intention of eating the banana, but because the monkey is familiar with it, it is fascinating. Monkey has not even intention of going closer to the banana. But experiments with rope, ladder, table and finds itself closer to the banana. Maybe due to all the experiments he becomes hungry and the reward is there (in the form of bananas), hence monkey stores the steps in memory.&nbsp;<br />\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Next time monkey gets hungry, he can just replay these actions using memory. This exhibits &quot;intelligence&quot;.</p>\n\n<p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\"><strong>Accidental Intelligence: (Driven by environment)</strong></p>\n\n<p style=\"margin-left: 80px;\">Ex. there is a monkey [who is not hungry], there is a rope, table, and ladder. There is a banana on the ceiling.<br />\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Due to some accident ladder falls right close to banana, and (maybe due to some accident) monkey climbs up the ladder. Now monkey if the monkey has observed the falling of the ladder, and closing the gaps between him and something that is desirable. This gets registered in memory.</p>\n\n<p style=\"margin-left: 80px;\">Next time when the monkey wants a banana, he will try to manipulate the ladder to reach the banana.<br />\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;This exhibits &quot;intelligence&quot;.</p>\n\n<p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">Bear in mind that many activities/experiments can go unfruitful.</p>\n\n<h2>&nbsp;</h2>\n\n<h2>Swarm Intelligence:</h2>\n\n<p>&nbsp;When individuals act in a group, and each individual follows only a certain set of rules, and behaves accordingly.<br />\n&nbsp;But the outcome that emerges, is not simple, and displays certain form of &quot;intelligence&quot;.<br />\n&nbsp;Examples of swarm intelligence in natural systems include&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ant_colony\" title=\"Ant colony\">ant colonies</a>, bird&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flocking_(behavior)\" title=\"Flocking (behavior)\">flocking</a>, animal&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herding\" title=\"Herding\">herding</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bacteria#Growth_and_reproduction\" title=\"Bacteria\">bacterial growth</a>, fish&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shoaling_and_schooling\" title=\"Shoaling and schooling\">schooling</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microbial_intelligence\" title=\"Microbial intelligence\">microbial intelligence</a>.</p>\n\n<h2><br />\nCrowd Intelligence:</h2>\n\n<p>A.K.A. &quot;Wisdom of the Crowd&quot; is the idea that the opinions of a group of people, when averaged out, can be better than the opinion of a single expert.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>For this wisdom to show up, it is required that the individuals give opinions independent of each other, they might have their individual biases but not general biases.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wisdom_of_the_crowd\" target=\"_blank\">Wikipedia</a></p>\n\n<h2>Human Intelligence:</h2>\n\n<p>&nbsp;(1) One single gene (or even a certain set of genes) doesn&#39;t decide the intelligence, but genetics definitely influences the IQ.<br />\n&nbsp;(2) Less intelligent implies more prejudice by correlation.<br />\n&nbsp;(3) Intelligence implies more drinking, less sexual interests by correlation.<br />\n&nbsp;(4) Those with higher IQ tend to worry more.<br />\n&nbsp;<br />\n&nbsp;Intelligence can be categorised in three broad categories:<br />\n&nbsp;(1) analytic, (2) creative, and (3) practical.&nbsp;<br />\n&nbsp;Going deeper, we can see 7 types of intelligence:</p>\n\n<ol>\n\t<li>&nbsp;linguistic,&nbsp;</li>\n\t<li>&nbsp;logical-mathematical,&nbsp;</li>\n\t<li>&nbsp;musical,&nbsp;</li>\n\t<li>&nbsp;bodily-kinesthetic,&nbsp;</li>\n\t<li>&nbsp;spatial,&nbsp;</li>\n\t<li>&nbsp;interpersonal,&nbsp;</li>\n\t<li>&nbsp;intrapersonal</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>&nbsp;<br />\n&nbsp;Creativity can be done in anything: mathematics, science, body, language (in form of prose, poetry, linguistic humour), space, etc...<br />\n&nbsp;Imagination is another realm of intelligence, which takes future into account.</p>\n\n<div class=\"math\">&nbsp;F = T \\nabla S_{\\tau}</div>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Intelligence is a force, F, that acts so as to maximize future freedom of action. It acts to maximize future freedom of action, or keep options open, with some strength T, with the diversity of possible accessible futures, S, up to some future time horizon, &tau;.
