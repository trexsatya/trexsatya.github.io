There are four varieties of it:</li>\n</ul>\n\n<ol style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">\n\t<li>Savitarka, when the mind meditates upon an object again and again, by isolating it from other objects.&nbsp; There are two sorts of objects for meditation, the categories of nature, and the Purusa.&nbsp;Again, the categories are of two varieties; the twenty-four categories are insentient, and the one sentient is the Purusa.&nbsp;When the mind thinks of the elements of nature by thinking of their beginning and their end, this is one sort of Savitarka. According to Sankhya philosophy, the&nbsp;mind-stuff (<em>Chitta</em>) takes in the forces of nature and projects them as thought. There must be something, again, where both force and matter are one. This is called Avyaktam, the unmanifested state of nature, before creation, and to which, after the end of a cycle, the whole of nature returns, to again come out after another period.</li>\n\t<li>Savitarka,&nbsp;Nirvitarka -&nbsp;That sort of meditation where the external gross elements are the objects is called Savitarka.&nbsp;Tarka means question, Savitarka with-question. Questioning the elements, as it were, that they may give up their truths and their powers to the man who meditates upon them.&nbsp;Nirvitarka -&nbsp;Again, in the very same meditation, when one struggles to take the elements out of time and space, and think of them as they are, it is called Nirvitarka, without-question</li>\n\t<li>Savichara,&nbsp;Nirvichara -&nbsp;When the meditation goes a step higher, and takes the Tanmatras as its object, and thinks of them as in time and space, it is called Savichara, with-discrimination, and when the same meditation gets beyond time and space and thinks of the fine elements as they are, it is called Nirvichara, without-discrimination.</li>\n\t<li>Sanandam,&nbsp;Asmita Samadhi -&nbsp;The next step is when the elements are given up, either as gross or as fine, and the object of meditation is the interior organ, the thinking organ, and when the thinking organ is thought of as bereft of the qualities of activity, and of dullness, it is then called Sanandam, the blissful Samadhi.&nbsp;In that Samadhi, when we are thinking of&nbsp;the mind as the object of meditation, before we have reached the state which takes us beyond the mind even, when it has become very ripe and concentrated, when all ideas of the gross materials, or fine materials, have been given up, and the only object is the mind as it is, when the Sattva state only of the Ego remains, but differentiated from all other objects, this is called Asmita Samadhi</li>\n</ol>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>Asamprajnata.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>18. \u0923\u0935\u092f\u093e\u092d\u092a\u094d\u0930\u0924\u094d\u092f\u092e\u093e\u092d\u094d\u092f\u093e\u0938\u0929\u0935\u0942 \u094d \u092f \u0938\u0938\u094d\u0915\u0902 \u093e\u092f\u0936\u0937\u0947\u094b\u093d\u0928\u094d\u092f\u094d \u0965 \u0967\u096e\u0965 <span style=\"color:#2980b9;\"><em>viramapratyayabhyasapoorvah sanskarashesho anyah </em></span></p>\n\n<p>There is another Samadhi which is attained by the constant practice of cessation of all mental activity, in which the Chitta retains only the unmanifested impressions.</p>\n\n<p>Its method is to hold the mind as the object, and whenever through comes, to strike it down, allowing no&nbsp;thought to come into the mind, thus making it an entire vacuum. When we can really do this, in that moment we shall attain liberation.&nbsp;When persons without training and preparation try to make their minds vacant they are likely to succeed only in covering themselves with Tamas, the material of ignorance, which makes the mind dull and stupid, and leads them to think that they are making a vacuum of the mind. To be able to really do that is a manifestation of the greatest strength, of the highest control.&nbsp;What will be the result of the constant practice of this higher&nbsp;concentration? All old tendencies of restlessness, and dullness, will be destroyed, as well as the tendencies of goodness too.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>According to the Sankhya Philosophy, there is no God. It says that there cannot be any God of this universe, because if there were He must be a Soul, and a Soul must be one of two things, either bound or free. How can the soul that is bound by nature, or controlled by nature, create? It is itself a slave. On the other hand, what business has the soul that is free to create and manipulate all these things? It has no desires, so cannot have&nbsp;any need to create. Secondly, it says the theory of God is an unnecessary one; nature explains all. What is the use of any God?</p>\n\n<p>But Kapila teaches that there are many souls, who, through nearly attaining perfection, fall short because they cannot perfectly renounce all powers. Their minds for a time merge in nature, to re-emerge as its masters. We shall all become such gods, and, according to the Sankhyas, the God spoken of in the Vedas really means one of these free souls. Beyond them, there is not an eternally free and blessed Creator of the universe.</p>\n\n<p>On the other hand, the Yogis say, &ldquo;Not so, there is a God; there is one Soul separate from all other souls, and He is the eternal Master of all creation, the Ever Free, the Teacher of all teachers.&rdquo; The Yogis admit that those the Sankhyas called &ldquo;merged in nature&rdquo; also exist.

By practice, the Yogi gets established in all these meditations.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>42. \u0924\u0924\u094d\u0930 \u0936\u092c\u094d\u0926\u093e\u0925\u093b \u092f \u093e\u0928\u0923\u0935\u0915\u0932\u094d\u092a\u094d \u0948 \u0938\u0915\u0902 \u0940\u093f\u093e \u092f \u0938\u0923\u0935\u0924\u0915\u093e \u092f \u0938\u092d\u093e\u0929\u0923\u0924\u094d\u0924\u094d \u0965 \u096a\u0968\u0965 <span style=\"color:#2980b9;\"><em>tatra shabdarthajnanavikalpaih sankeerna savitarka samapattih </em></span></p>\n\n<p>Sound, meaning, and the resulting knowledge, being mixed up, is (called Samadhi) with reasoning.</p>\n\n<p>Sound here means vibration; meaning, the nerve currents which conduct it; and knowledge, reaction.

We can get rid of them. We will first try to understand what these three are. Here is the Chitta; you will always remember the simile of the lake, the mind-stuff, and the vibration, the word, the sound, like a pulsation coming over it. You have that calm lake in you, and I pronounce a word, &ldquo;cow.&rdquo; As soon as it enters through&nbsp;your ears there is a wave produced in your Chitta along with it. So that wave represents the idea of the cow, the form or the meaning as we call it. That apparent cow that you know is really that wave in the mind-stuff, and that comes as a reaction to the internal and external sound vibrations, and with the sound, the wave dies away; that wave can never exist without a word.&nbsp;You may ask how it is when we only think of the cow and do not hear a sound. You make that sound yourself. You are saying &ldquo;cow&rdquo; faintly in your mind, and with that comes a wave. There cannot be any wave without this impulse of sound, and when it is not from outside it is from inside, and when the sound dies, the wave dies. What remains?&nbsp;The result of the reaction, and that is knowledge. These three are so closely combined in our mind that we cannot separate them. When the sound comes, the senses vibrate, and the wave rises in reaction; they follow so closely upon one another that there is no discerning one from the other; when this meditation has been practiced for a long time, memory, the receptacle of all impressions, becomes purified, and we are able clearly to distinguish them from one another. This is called &ldquo;Nirvitarka,&rdquo; concentration without reasoning.</p>\n\n<p>44. \u090f\u0924\u092e\u0935 \u0948 \u0938\u0923\u0935\u091a\u093e\u092f\u093e \u0923\u0928\u0923\u0935\u091a \u092f \u093e\u092f\u093e \u091a \u0938\u0915\u094d\u0937\u094d\u092e\u0942 \u0923\u0935\u0937\u092e\u093e \u0935\u094d\u092f\u093e\u0916\u094d\u092f\u093e\u0924\u093e \u0965 \u096a\u096a\u0965 <span style=\"color:#2980b9;\"><em>etayaiva savichara nirvichara cha sookshmavishaya vyakhyata </em></span></p>\n\n<p>By this process (the concentrations) with discrimination and without discrimination, whose objects are finer, are (also) explained.</p>\n\n<p>A process similar to the preceding is applied again, only, the objects to be taken up in the former meditations are gross; in this they are fine.</p>\n\n<p>45. \u0938\u0915\u094d\u0937\u094d\u092e\u0942 \u0923\u0935\u0937\u092e\u0924\u094d\u0935\u0902\u091a\u093e\u0923\u0930\u0919\u094d\u0917\u0929\u092e\u0935 \u092f \u0938\u093e\u0928\u092d \u0965\u094d \u096a\u096b\u0965 <span style=\"color:#2980b9;\"><em>sookshmavishayatvan chalinggaparyavasanam </em></span></p>\n\n<p>The finer objects end with the Pradhana.</p>\n\n<p>The gross objects are only the elements, and everything manufactured out of them.

Holding the reins firmly while guiding this body and mind: not letting the body do anything it likes, but keeping them both in proper control. Study. What is meant by study in this case? Not study of novels, or fiction, or storybooks, but study of those books which teach the liberation of the soul. Then again this study does not mean controversial&nbsp;studies at all. The Yogi is supposed to have finished his period of controversy.&nbsp;He only studies to intensify his convictions. Vada and Siddhanta. These are the two sorts of Scriptural knowledge, Vada (the argumentative) and Siddhanta (the decisive).</p>\n\n<p>Books are infinite in number, and time is short; therefore this is the secret of knowledge, to take that which is essential. Take that out, and then try to live up to it. There is an old simile in India that if you place a cup of milk before a Raja Hamsa (swan) with plenty of water in it, he will take all the milk and leave the water. In that way, we should take what is of value in knowledge, and leave the dross. All these intellectual gymnastics are necessary at first. We must not go blindly into anything.</p>\n\n<p>The Yogi has passed the argumentative stage and has come to a conclusion, which is like the rocks, immovable. The only thing he now seeks to do is to intensify that conclusion. Do not argue, he say; if one forces arguments upon you, be silent. Do not answer any argument, but go away free, because arguments only disturb the mind. The only thing is to train the intellect, so what is the use of disturbing it anymore. The intellect is but a weak instrument, and can give only knowledge limited by the senses; the Yogi wants to go beyond the senses; therefore the intellect is of no use to him. He is certain of this, and therefore is silent, and does not argue.&nbsp;Every argument throws his mind out of balance, creates a disturbance in the Chitta, and this&nbsp;disturbance is a drawback. These argumentations and searchings of the reason are only on the way. There are much higher things behind them. The whole of life is not for schoolboy fights and debating societies. By &ldquo;surrendering the fruits of work to God&rdquo; is to take to ourselves neither credit nor blame, but to give both up to the Lord, and be at peace.</p>\n\n<p>2. \u0938\u092d\u093e\u0923\u0927\u092c\u093e\u0935\u0928\u093e\u0925\u094d \u092f \u093f\u0947\u0936\u0924\u0928\u0915\u0942 \u092f\u093f\u093e\u0925\u093f \u092f \u0965 \u0968\u0965 samadhibhavanarthah kleshatanookaranarthashch</p>\n\n<p>(They are for) the practice of Samadhi and minimizing the pain-bearing obstructions.</p>\n\n<p>Most of us make our minds like spoiled children, allowing them to do whatever they want.

There is no limit to man&rsquo;s desires; he goes on desring, and when he comes to a point where desire cannot be fulfilled, the result is pain.</p>\n\n<p>13. \u0938\u0923\u0924 \u092d\u0930\u0942 \u0947\u0924\u0923\u093f\u0929\u093e\u0915\u094b \u091c\u093e\u0924\u094d\u092f\u093e\u092e\u092c\u0941\u094b\u0917\u093e\u094d \u0965 \u0967\u0969\u0965 sati moole tadvipako jatyayurbhogah</p>\n\n<p>The root being there, the fruition comes (in the form&nbsp;of) species, life, and expression of pleasure and pain.</p>\n\n<p>14. \u0924\u0947\u0939\u094d\u0932\u093e\u0926\u0929\u0923\u092f\u0924\u093e\u0929\u092a\u0930\u093e\u094d \u0929\u0923\u094d\u0941\u092e\u093e\u0929\u0923\u094d\u0941\u092e\u0939\u0924\u0947 \u0924\u094d\u0935\u0941 \u093e\u0924 \u0965\u094d \u0967\u096a\u0965 te hladaparitapafalah punyapunyahetutvat</p>\n\n<p>They bear fruit as pleasure or pain, caused by virtue or vice.</p>\n\n<p>15. \u0929\u0923\u092f\u093f\u093e\u092d\u0924\u093e\u0929\u0938\u0938\u094d\u0915\u0902 \u093e\u092f\u0926\u0941\u094d\u0916\u0917 \u0948 \u093f \u092f\u0941\u0935\u0923\u0943\u0924\u094d\u0924\u0923\u0935\u092f\u094b\u0927\u093e\u091a\u094d\u091a \u0926\u0941\u094d\u0916\u092d \u090f\u094d\u0935 \u0938\u0935 \u0902 \u0923\u0935\u0935\u0923\u0947\u0915\u0928\u094d \u0965 \u0967\u096b\u0965 parinamatapasanskaraduhkhairgunnavritti - virodhaccha duhkham eva sarvan vivekinah</p>\n\n<p>To the discriminating, all is, as it were, painful on account of everything bringing pain, either in the consequences, or in apprehension, or in attitude caused by impressions, also on account of the counter action of qualities.</p>\n\n<p>Even love is selfish, and the Yogi says that, in the end, we shall find that even the love of husbands and wives, and children and friends, slowly decays.

That the Purusa may gain experience. The Purusa has, as it were, forgotten its mighty, godly, nature.&nbsp;The Purusa does not live; it is life itself. It does not exist; it is existence itself. The Soul does not know; it is knowledge itself. It is an entire mistake to say that the Soul lives, or knows, or loves. Love and existence are not the qualities of the Purusa, but its essence.&nbsp;When they get reflected upon something you may call them the qualities of that something.

In this nature there are three sorts of materials, the Sattva, the Rajas, and the&nbsp;Tamas. The Tamas material is all that is dark, all that is ignorant and heavy; and the Rajas is activity. The Sattvas is calmness, light. When nature is in the state before creation, it is called by them Avyaktam, undefined, or indiscrete; that is, in which there is no distinction of form or name, a state in which these three materials are held in perfect balance. Then the balance is disturbed, these different materials begin to mingle in various fashions, and the result is this universe. In every man, also, these three materials exist.&nbsp;When the Sattva material prevails knowledge comes. When the Rajas material prevails activity comes, and when the Tamas material prevails darkness comes and lassitude, idleness, ignorance. According to the Sankhya theory, the highest manifestation of this nature, consisting of these three materials, is what they call Mahat, or intelligence, universal intelligence, and each human mind is a part of that cosmic intelligence.&nbsp;Then out of Mahat comes the mind. In the Sankhya Psychology there is a sharp distinction between Manas, the mind function, and the function of the Buddhi intellect. The mind function is simply to collect and carry impressions and present them to the Buddhi, the individual Mahat, and the Buddhi determined upon it. So, out of Mahat comes mind, and out of mind comes fine material, and this fine material combines and becomes the gross material outside&mdash;the external universe. The claim of the Sankhya philosophy is that beginning with the intellect, and coming down to a block of stone, all has come out of the same thing, only as finer or grosser states of existence.&nbsp;The Buddhi is the finest state of existence of the materials, and then comes Ahamkara, egoism, and next to the mind comes fine material, which they call Tanmatras, which cannot be seen, but which are inferred.&nbsp;These Tanmatras combine and&nbsp;become grosser, and finally produce this universe. The finer is the cause, and the grosser is the effect. It begins with the Buddhi, which is the finest material, and goes on becoming grosser and grosser, until it becomes this universe.&nbsp;According to the Sankhya philosophy, beyond the whole of this nature is the Purusa, which is not material at all. Purusa is not at all similar to anything else, either Buddhi, or mind, or the Tanmatras, or the gross material; it is not akin to any one of these, it is entirely separate, entirely different in its nature, and from this they argue that the Purusa must be immortal, because it is not the result of combination. That which is not the result of combination cannot die, these Purusas or Souls are infinite in number.&nbsp;Now we shall understand the Aphorism, that the states of the qualities are defined, undefined, and signless. By the defined is meant the gross elements, which we can sense. By the undefined is meant the very fine materials, the Tanmatras, which cannot be sensed by ordinary men. If you practice Yoga, however, says Patanjali, after a while your perception will become so fine that you will actually see the Tanmatras. For instance, you have heard how every man has a certain light about him; every living being is emanating a certain light, and this, he says, can be seen by the Yogi. We do not all see it, but we are all throwing out these Tanmatras, just as a flower is continuously emanating these Tanmatras, which enable us to smell it.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;the indicated only&rdquo; means the Buddhi, the intellect. &ldquo;The indicated only&rdquo; is the first manifestation of nature; from it all other manifestations proceed.</p>\n\n<p>The last is &ldquo;the signless.&rdquo;&nbsp;out of intelligence comes what we call gross matter. Modern philosophers say that intelligence is the last to come. They say that unintelligent things slowly evolve into animals, and from animals slowly evolve into men. They claim that instead of everything coming out of intelligence, intelligence is itself the last to come. Both the religious and the scientific statement, though seemingly directly opposed to each other, are true.&nbsp;Take an infinite series A&mdash;B&mdash;A&mdash;B&mdash;A&mdash;B, etc. The question is which is first, A or B. If you take the series as A&mdash;, you will say that A is first, but if you take it as B&mdash;A you will say that B is first. It depends on the way you are looking at it.&nbsp;Intelligence evolves, and becomes the gross material, and this again evolves as intelligence, and again evolves as matter once more.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Indian philosophy, however, goes beyond both intelligence and matter, and finds a Purusa, or Self, which is beyond all intelligence, and of which intelligence is but the borrowed light.</p>\n\n<p>20. \u0926\u094d\u0930\u0937\u094d\u091f\u093e \u0926\u0943\u0923\u0936\u092d\u093e\u0924\u094d\u0930\u094d \u0936\u0926\u094d\u0927\u0941\u094b\u093d\u0923\u0929 \u092a\u094d\u0930\u0924\u094d\u092f\u092e\u093e\u0928\u0929\u0941\u0936\u094d\u092e\u094d \u0965 \u0968\u0966\u0965 drashta drishimatrah shuddhopi pratyayanupashyah</p>\n\n<p>The seer is intelligence only, and though pure, seen through the colouring of the intellect.</p>\n\n<p>Certainly intelligence is manufactured, and that very fact shows us that there must be something beyond that, because it cannot be free. Everything connected with matter is in nature, and therefore bound for ever. Who is free? That free one must certainly be beyond cause and effect.&nbsp;If you say that the idea of freedom is a delusion, I will say that the idea of bondage is also a delusion.&nbsp;If one idea is a delusion, the other is also a delusion, because both stand upon the same basis&mdash;consciousness. The Yogi says both are true; that we are bound so far as intelligence goes, that we are free as far as the soul is concerned.&nbsp;Intelligence has no light of its own. Each organ has a particular centre in the brain; it is not that all the organs have one centre; each organ is separate. Why do all these perceptions harmonise, and where do they get their unity? If it were in the brain there would be one centre only for the eyes, the nose, the ears, while we know for certain that there are different centres for each. But a man can see and hear at the same time, so a unity must be back of intelligence.&nbsp;Intelligence is eternally connected with the brain, but behind even intelligence stands the Purusa, the unit, where all these different sensations and perceptions join and become one.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>21. \u0924\u0926\u0925 \u092f \u090f\u0935 \u0926\u0943\u0936\u094d\u092e\u0938\u094d\u092f\u093e\u0924\u094d\u092e\u093e \u0965 \u0968\u0967\u0965 tadarth eva drishyasyatma</p>\n\n<p>The nature of the experience is for him.</p>\n\n<p>22. \u0915\u0943\u0924\u093e\u0925 \u0902 \u092a\u094d\u0930\u0923\u0924 \u0928\u0937\u094d\u091f\u092d\u092a\u094d\u092f\u0928\u0937\u094d\u091f\u0902\u0924\u0926\u0928\u094d\u092f\u0938\u093e\u0927\u093e\u092f\u093f\u0924\u094d\u0935\u093e\u0924 \u0965\u094d \u0968\u0968\u0965 kritarthan prati nashtam apyanashtan tadanyasadharannatvat</p>\n\n<p>Though destroyed for him whose goal has been gained, yet is not destroyed, being common to others.</p>\n\n<p>23. \u0938\u094d\u0935\u0938\u094d\u0935\u093e\u0923\u092d\u0936\u0915\u094d\u0924\u094d\u092f\u094b\u094d \u0938\u094d\u0935\u0930\u0942\u0929\u094b\u0929\u0930\u0923\u092c\u094d\u0927\u0939\u0924\u0947 \u094d\u0941\u0938\u092e\u0902 \u094b\u0917\u094d \u0965 \u0968\u0969\u0965 svasvamishaktyoh svaroopopalabdhihetuh sanyogah</p>\n\n<p>Junction is the cause of the realisation of the nature of&nbsp;both the powers, the experienced and its Lord.</p>\n\n<p>24. \u0924\u0938\u094d\u092f \u0939\u0924\u0947 \u092f\u0941\u0923\u0935\u0926\u094d\u092f\u093e \u0965 \u0968\u096a\u0965 tasya heturavidya</p>\n\n<p>Ignorance is its cause.</p>\n\n<p>25. \u0924\u0926\u092c\u093e\u0935\u093e\u0924 \u0938\u094d \u092e\u0902 \u094b\u0917\u093e\u092c\u093e\u0935\u094b \u0939\u093e\u0928\u0902\u0924\u0926\u094d\u0926\u0943\u0936\u094d\u0947 \u0915 \u0948 \u0935\u0932\u094d\u092f\u092d \u0965\u094d \u0968\u096b\u0965 tadabhavat sanyogabhavo hanan taddrisheh kaivalyam</p>\n\n<p>There being absence of that (ignorance) there is absence of junction, which is the thing-to-be-avoided; that is the independence of the seer.</p>\n\n<p>26. \u0923\u0935\u0935\u0915\u0947 \u0916\u094d\u092f\u093e\u0923\u0924\u092f\u0923\u0935\u092a\u094d\u0932\u0935\u093e \u0939\u093e\u0928\u094b\u0929\u093e\u092e\u094d \u0965 \u0968\u096c\u0965 vivekakhyatiraviplava hanopayah</p>\n\n<p>The means of destruction of ignorance is unbroken practice of discrimination.</p>\n\n<p>27. \u0924\u0938\u094d\u092f \u0938\u092a\u094d\u0924\u0927\u093e \u092a\u094d\u0930\u093e\u0928\u094d\u0924\u092c\u0923\u0942\u092d\u094d \u092a\u094d\u0930\u093b\u093e \u0965 \u0968\u096d\u0965 tasya saptadhaa prantabhoomih prajna</p>\n\n<p>His knowledge is of the sevenfold highest ground.</p>\n\n<p>The first to appear will be that we have known what is to be known.
