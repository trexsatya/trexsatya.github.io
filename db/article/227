Memory is another class of Vrttis,&nbsp;which is called Smrti.</p>\n\n<p>11. अनबुतूणवषमासप्रं भोष् स्मणृत् ॥ ११॥ <span style=\"color:#2980b9;\"><em>anubhoot-avishayasan-pramoshah smritih </em></span></p>\n\n<p>Memory is when the (Vrttis of) perceived subjects do not slip away (and through impressions come back to consciousness).</p>\n\n<p>So in sleep. When the peculiar kind of ripple called sleep throws the Chitta into a ripple of memory it is called a dream.

These three qualities manifest themselves in the physical world as attraction, repulsion, and control.</p>\n\n<p>Everything that is in nature, all these manifestations, are combinations and recombinations of these three forces.</p>\n\n<p>17. णवतक यणवचायानन्दाणस्मतारूऩानगुभात स् प्रं ऻात् ॥ १७॥ <span style=\"color:#2980b9;\"><em>vitarkavicharanandasmitaroopanugamat sanprajnatah </em></span></p>\n\n<p>The concentration called right know-ledge is that which is followed by reasoning, discrimination, bliss, unqualified ego.</p>\n\n<p>This Samadhi is divided into two varieties:</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>Samprajnata:&nbsp;In this Samadhi come all the powers of controlling nature. There are four varities of it:</li>\n</ul>\n\n<ol style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">\n\t<li>Savitarka, when the mind meditates upon an object again and again, by isolating it from other objects.&nbsp; There are two sorts of objects for meditation, the categories of nature, and the Purusa.&nbsp;Again, the categories are of two varieties; the twenty-four categories are insentient, and the one sentient is the Purusa.&nbsp;When the mind thinks of the elements of nature by thinking of their beginning and their end, this is one sort of Savitarka. According to Sankhya philosophy, the&nbsp;mind-stuff (<em>Chitta</em>) takes in the forces of nature, and projects them as thought. There must be something, again, where both force and matter are one. This is called Avyaktam, the unmanifested state of nature, before creation, and to which, after the end of a cycle, the whole of nature returns, to again come out after another period.</li>\n\t<li>Savitarka,&nbsp;Nirvitarka -&nbsp;That sort of meditation where the external gross elements are the objects is called Savitarka.&nbsp;Tarka means question, Savitarka with-question. Questioning the elements, as it were, that they may give up their truths and their powers to the man who meditates upon them.&nbsp;Nirvitarka -&nbsp;Again, in the very same meditation, when one struggles to take the elements out of time and space, and think of them as they are, it is called Nirvitarka, without-question</li>\n\t<li>Savichara,&nbsp;Nirvichara -&nbsp;When the meditation goes a step higher, and takes the Tanmatras as its object, and thinks of them as in time and space, it is called Savichara, with-discrimination, and when the same meditation gets beyond time and space, and thinks of the fine elements as they are, it is called Nirvichara, without-discrimination.</li>\n\t<li>Sanandam,&nbsp;Asmita Samadhi -&nbsp;The next step is when the elements are given up, either as gross or as fine, and the object of meditation is the interior organ, the thinking organ, and when the thinking organ is thought of as bereft of the qualities of activity, and of dullness, it is then called Sanandam, the blissful Samadhi.&nbsp;In that Samadhi, when we are thinking of&nbsp;the mind as the object of meditation, before we have reached the state which takes us beyond the mind even, when it has become very ripe and concentrated, when all ideas of the gross materials, or fine materials, have been given up, and the only object is the mind as it is, when the Sattva state only of the Ego remains, but differentiated from all other objects, this is called Asmita Samadhi</li>\n</ol>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>Asamprajnata.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>18. णवयाभप्रत्यमाभ्यासऩवू ् य सस्कं ायशषेोऽन्य् ॥ १८॥ <span style=\"color:#2980b9;\"><em>viramapratyayabhyasapoorvah sanskarashesho anyah </em></span></p>\n\n<p>There is another Samadhi which is attained by the constant practice of cessation of all mental activity, in which the Chitta retains only the unmanifested impressions.</p>\n\n<p>Its method is to hold the mind as the object, and whenever through comes, to strike it down, allowing no&nbsp;thought to come into the mind, thus making it an entire vacuum. When we can really do this, in that moment we shall attain liberation.&nbsp;When persons without training and preparation try to make their minds vacant they are likely to succeed only in covering themselves with Tamas, material of ignorance, which makes the mind dull and stupid, and leads them to think that they are making a vacuum of the mind. To be able to really do that is a manifestation of the greatest strength, of the highest control.&nbsp;What will be the result of constant practice of this higher&nbsp;concentration? All old tendencies of restlessness, and dullness, will be destroyed, as well as the tendencies of goodness too.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>According to the Sankhya Philosophy there is no God. It says that there cannot be any God of this universe, because if there were He must be a Soul, and a Soul must be one of two things, either bound or free. How can the soul that is bound by nature, or controlled by nature, create? It is itself a slave. On the other hand, what business has the soul that is free to create and manipulate all these things? It has no desires, so cannot have&nbsp;any need to create. Secondly, it says the theory of God is an unnecessary one; nature explains all. What is the use of any God?</p>\n\n<p>But Kapila teaches that there are many souls, who, through nearly attaining perfection, fall short because they cannot perfectly renounce all powers. Their minds for a time merge in nature, to re-emerge as its masters. We shall all become such gods, and, according to the Sankhyas, the God spoken of in the Vedas really means one of these free souls. Beyond them there is not an eternally free and blessed Creator of the universe.</p>\n\n<p>On the other hand the Yogis say, &ldquo;Not so, there is a God; there is one Soul separate from all other souls, and He is the eternal Master of all creation, the Ever Free, the Teacher of all teachers.&rdquo; The Yogis admit that those the Sankhyas called &ldquo;merged in nature&rdquo; also exist. They are Yogis who have fallen short of perfection, and though, for a time debarred from attaining the goal, remain as rulers of parts of the universe.</p>\n\n<p>19. बवप्रत्यमो णवदहेप्रकृणतरमानाभ ॥् १९॥ <span style=\"color:#2980b9;\"><em>bhavapratyayo videhaprakritilayanam </em></span></p>\n\n<p>(This Samadhi, when not followed by extreme non-attachment) becomes the cause of the re-manifestation of the gods and of those that become merged in nature.</p>\n\n<p>20. श्रद्धावीमस्म य णृतसभाणधप्रऻाऩवूक य इतयषेाभ ॥् २०॥ <span style=\"color:#2980b9;\"><em>shraddhaviryasmritisamadhiprajnapoorvaka itaresham </em></span></p>\n\n<p>To others (this Samadhi) comes through faith, energy, memory, concentration, and discrimination of the real. These are they who do not want the position of gods, or even that of rulers of cycles.

The Yogis, however, avoid many ideas about God, such as creating. God as the Creator of the Universe is not meant by the Isvara of the Yogis, although, according to the Vedas, Isvara is the Creator of the universe. Seeing that the universe is harmonious, it must be the manifestation of one will. The Yogis and Sankhyas both avoid the question of creation. The Yogis want to establish a God, but carefully avoid this question; they do not raise it at all. Yet you will find that they arrive at God in a peculiar fashion of their own. They say:</p>\n\n<p>25. तत्र णनयणतशमंसवऻ य त्वफीजभ ॥् २५॥ <span style=\"color:#2980b9;\"><em>tatra niratishayan sarvajntvabijam </em></span></p>\n\n<p>In Him becomes infinite that all-knowing-ness which in others is (only) a germ.</p>\n\n<p>26. स ऩवूष े ाभ ् अणऩ गरुु् कारेनानवच्छदेात ॥् २६॥ <span style=\"color:#2980b9;\"><em>sa poorvesham api guruh kalenanavachchhedat </em></span></p>\n\n<p>He is the Teacher of even the ancient teachers, being not limited by time.</p>\n\n<p>We cannot find any knowledge without teacher, if there are men teachers, god teachers, or angel teachers, they are all limited; who was the teacher before them? We are forced to admit, as a last conclusion, One Teacher, Who is not limited by time, and that One Teacher or infinite knowledge, without beginning or end, is called God.</p>\n\n<p>27. तस्य वाचक् प्रिव् ॥ २७॥ <span style=\"color:#2980b9;\"><em>tasya vachakah prannavah </em></span></p>\n\n<p>His manifesting word is Om.</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;Although the relation between thought and word is perfectly natural, yet it does not mean a rigid connection between one sound and one idea.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>Is there any material sound of which all other sounds&nbsp;must be manifestations, one which is the most natural sound? Om (Aum) is such a sound, the basis of all sounds.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>28. तज्जऩस्तदथब य ावनभ ॥् २८॥ <span style=\"color:#2980b9;\"><em>tajjapastadarthabhavanam </em></span></p>\n\n<p>The repetition of this (Om) and meditating on its meaning (is the way).</p>\n\n<p>29. तत् प्रत्यक्चेतनाणधगभोऽप्यन्तयामाबावि ॥ २९॥<span style=\"color:#2980b9;\"><em> tatah pratyakchetanadhigamopyantarayabhavashch </em></span></p>\n\n<p>From that is gain (the knowledge of) introspection, and the destruction of obstacles.</p>\n\n<p>What are the obstacles to the Yogi?</p>\n\n<p>30. व्याणधस्त्यानसशं मप्रभादारस्याणवयणतभ्राणन्तदशन य ारब्धबणूभक - त्वानवणस्थतत्वाणन णचत्तणवऺऩेास्तऽेन्तयामा् ॥ ३०॥ <span style=\"color:#2980b9;\"><em>vyadhistyanasanshayapramadalasyaviratibhrantidar shanalabdhabhoomikatvanavasthitatvani chittavikshepastentarayah </em></span></p>\n\n<p>Disease, mental laziness, doubt, calmness, cessation, false perception, non-attaining concentration, and falling away from the state when obtained, are the obstructing distractions.</p>\n\n<p>31. दु्खदौभन य स्याङ्गभजे मत्वश्वासप्रश्वासा णवऺऩेसहबवु् ॥ ३१॥ <span style=\"color:#2980b9;\"><em>duhkhadaurmanasyanggamejayatvashvasaprashvaa vikshepasahabhuvah </em></span></p>\n\n<p>Grief, mental distress, tremor of the body and irregular breathing, accompany non-retention of concentration.</p>\n\n<p>32. तत्प्रणतषधेाथभ य ए्कतत्त्वाभ्यास् ॥ ३२॥ <span style=\"color:#2980b9;\"><em>tatpratishedhartham ekatattvabhyasah </em></span></p>\n\n<p>To remedy this practice of one subject (should be made).</p>\n\n<p>(There are other ways also:)</p>\n\n<p>33. भत्र ैीकरुिाभणुदतोऩऺे िांसखु दु्खऩण्ुमाऩण्ुमणवषमािां बावनातणित्तप्रसादनभ ॥् ३३॥ <span style=\"color:#2980b9;\"><em>maitreekarunamuditopekshanan sukhaduhkhapunyapunyavishayanan bhavanatashchittaprasadanam </em></span></p>\n\n<p>Friendship, mercy, gladness, indifference, being thought of in regard to subjects, happy, unhappy, good and evil respectively, pacify the Chitta.</p>\n\n<p>34. प्रच्छदन य णवधायिाभ्यांवा प्रािस्य ॥ ३४॥ <span style=\"color:#2980b9;\"><em>prachchhardanavidharanabhyan va prannasya </em></span></p>\n\n<p>By throwing out and restraining the Prana.</p>\n\n<p>Prana is not exactly breath. It is the name for the energy that is in the universe.&nbsp;The whole universe is a combination of Prana and Akasa; so is the human body. Out of Akasa you get the different materials that you feel, and see, and out of Prana all the various forces.&nbsp;Now this throwing out and restraining the Prana is what is called&nbsp;Pranayama. Patanjali, the father of the Yoga Philosophy, does not give many particular directions about Pranayama, but later on other Yogis found out various things about this Pranayama, and made of it a great science.</p>\n\n<p>The Chitta, the mind-stuff, is the engine which draws in the Prana from the surroundings, and manufactures out of this Prana the various vital forces.&nbsp;First of all the forces that keep the body in preservation, and lastly thought, will, and all other powers.</p>\n\n<p>35. णवषमवती वा प्रवणृत्तरुत्पिा भनस् णस्थणतणनफणिनी ॥ ३५॥ <span style=\"color:#2980b9;\"><em>vishayavati va pravrittirutpanna manasah sthitinibandhini </em></span></p>\n\n<p>Those forms of concentration that bring extraordinary sense perceptions cause perseverance of the mind.</p>\n\n<p>the Yogis say, if the mind becomes concentrated on the tip of the nose one begins to smell, after a few days, wonderful perfumes.</p>\n\n<p>If it becomes concentrated at the root of the tongue one begins to here sounds; if on the tip of the tongue one begins to taste wonderful flavours; if on the middle of the tongue, one feels as if he were coming in contact with something. If one concentrates his mind on the palate he begins to see peculiar things. If a man whose mind is disturbed wants to take up some of these practices of Yoga, yet doubts the truth of them, he will have his doubts set at rest, when, after a little practice, these things come to him, and he will persevere.</p>\n\n<p>36. णवशोका वा ज्योणतष्मती ॥ ३६॥ <span style=\"color:#2980b9;\"><em>vishoka va jyotishmati </em></span></p>\n\n<p>Or (by the meditation on) the Effulgent One which is beyond all sorrow.</p>\n\n<p>This is another sort of concentration. Think of the lotus of the&nbsp;heart, with petals downwards, and ruunning through it the Sucumna; take in the breath, and while throwing the breat out imagine that the lotus is turned with the petals upwards, and inside that lotus is an effulgent light. Meditate on that.</p>\n\n<p>37. वीतयागणवषमंवा णचत्तभ ॥् ३७॥ <span style=\"color:#2980b9;\"><em>vitaragavishayan va chittam </em></span></p>\n\n<p>Or (by meditation on) the heart [of a holy person]&nbsp;that has given up all attachment to sense objects.</p>\n\n<p>38. स्वप्नणनद्राऻानारम्बनं वा ॥ ३८॥ <span style=\"color:#2980b9;\"><em>svapnanidrajnanalambanan va </em></span></p>\n\n<p>Or by meditating on the knowledge that comes in sleep.</p>\n\n<p>39. मथाणबभतध्यानाद ्वा ॥ ३९॥ <span style=\"color:#2980b9;\"><em>yathabhimatadhyanad va </em></span></p>\n\n<p>Or by meditation on anything that appeals to one as good.</p>\n\n<p>This does not mean any wicked subject, but anything good that you like, any place that you like best, any scenery that you like best, any idea that you like best, anything that will concentrate the mind.</p>\n\n<p>40. ऩयभािुऩयभभहत्त्वान्तोऽस्य वशीकाय् ॥ ४०॥ <span style=\"color:#2980b9;\"><em>paramanu paramamahattvantosya vashikarah </em></span></p>\n\n<p>The Yogi&rsquo;s mind thus meditating, becomes un-obstructed from the atomic to the Infinite.</p>\n\n<p>41. ऺीिवत्तृ येणबजातस्यवे भिर्ग्े ह य ीतर्ग्ृ हिर्ग्ाह्यषे ु तत्स्थतदञ्जनतासभाऩणत्त् ॥ ४१॥ <span style=\"color:#2980b9;\"><em>ksheennavritterabhijatasyev manergrahitrigrahannagrahyeshu tatsthatadangjanatasamapattih </em></span></p>\n\n<p>The Yogi whose Vrttis have thus become powerless (controlled) obtains in the receiver, receiving, and&nbsp;received (the self, the mind and external objects), concentratedness and sameness, like the crystal (before different coloured objects.)</p>\n\n<p>Here the Yogi sees the three things, the receiver, the received, and the receiving, corresponding to the Soul, the object, and the mind. There are three objects of meditation given us. Firs the gross things, as bodies, or material objects, second fine things, as the mind, the Chitta, and third the Purasa qualified, not the Purasa itself, but the egoism. By practice, the Yogi gets established in all these meditations.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>42. तत्र शब्दाथऻ य ानणवकल्प् ै सकं ीिा य सणवतका य सभाऩणत्त् ॥ ४२॥ <span style=\"color:#2980b9;\"><em>tatra shabdarthajnanavikalpaih sankeerna savitarka samapattih </em></span></p>\n\n<p>Sound, meaning, and resulting knowledge, being mixed up, is (called Samadhi) with reasoning.</p>\n\n<p>Sound here means vibration; meaning, the nerve currents which conduct it; and knowledge, reaction. All the various meditations we have had so far, Patanjali calls Savitarka (meditations with reasoning).</p>\n\n<p>43. स्मणृतऩणयशद्धुौ स्वरूऩशन्यू वेाथभ य ात्रणनबास य ा णनणवत य का य॥ ४३॥ <span style=\"color:#2980b9;\"><em>smritiparishuddhau svaroopashoonyevarthamatranirbhasa nirvitarka </em></span></p>\n\n<p>The Samadhi called without reasoning (comes) when the memory is purified, or devoid of qualities, expressing only the meaning (of the meditated object).</p>\n\n<p>It is by practice of meditation of these three that we come to the state where these three do not mix. We can get rid of them. We will first try to understand what these three are. Here is the Chitta; you will always remember the simile of the lake, the mind-stuff, and the vibration, the word, the sound, like a pulsation coming over it. You have that calm lake in you, and I pronounce a word, &ldquo;cow.&rdquo; As soon as it enters through&nbsp;your ears there is a wave produced in your Chitta along with it. So that wave represents the idea of the cow, the form or the meaning as we call it. That apparent cow that you know is really that wave in the mind-stuff, and that comes as a reaction to the internal and external sound-vibrations, and with the sound, the wave dies away; that wave can never exist without a word.&nbsp;You may ask how it is when we only think of the cow, and do not hear a sound. You make that sound yourself. You are saying &ldquo;cow&rdquo; faintly in your mind, and with that comes a wave. There cannot be any wave without this impulse of sound, and when it is not from outside it is from inside, and when the sound dies, the wave dies. What remains?&nbsp;The result of the reaction, and that is knowledge. These three are so closely combined in our mind that we cannot separate them. When the sound comes, the senses vibrate, and the wave rises in reaction; they follow so closely upon one another that there is no discerning one from the other; when this meditation has been practiced for a long time, memory, the receptacle of all impressions, becomes purified, and wwe are able clearly to distinguish them from one another. This is called &ldquo;Nirvitarka,&rdquo; concentration without reasoning.</p>\n\n<p>44. एतमव ै सणवचाया णनणवच य ाया च सक्ष्मू णवषमा व्याख्याता ॥ ४४॥ <span style=\"color:#2980b9;\"><em>etayaiva savichara nirvichara cha sookshmavishaya vyakhyata </em></span></p>\n\n<p>By this process (the concentrations) with discrim-ination and without discrimination, whose objects are finer, are (also) explained.</p>\n\n<p>A process similar to the preceding is applied again, only, the objects to be taken up in the former meditations are gross; in this they are fine.</p>\n\n<p>45. सक्ष्मू णवषमत्वंचाणरङ्गऩमव य सानभ ॥् ४५॥ <span style=\"color:#2980b9;\"><em>sookshmavishayatvan chalinggaparyavasanam </em></span></p>\n\n<p>The finer objects end with the Pradhana.</p>\n\n<p>The gross objects are only the elements, and everything manufactured out of them.

The first step, the preliminary step, is called Kriya Yoga. Literally this means work, working towards Yoga.</p>\n\n<p>What is meant&nbsp;by mortification? Holding the reins firmly while guiding this body and mind: not letting the body do anything it likes, but keeping them both in proper control. Study. What is meant by study in this case? Not study of novels, or fiction, or story books, but study of those books which teach the liberation of the soul. Then again this study does not mean controversial&nbsp;studies at all. The Yogi is supposed to have finished his period of controversy.&nbsp;He only studies to intensify his convictions. Vada and Siddhanta. These are the two sorts of Scriptural knowledge, Vada (the argumentative) and Siddhanta (the decisive).</p>\n\n<p>Books are infinite in number, and time is short; thereofre this is the secret of knowledge, to take that which is essential. Take that out, and then try to live up to it. There is an old simile in India that if you place a cup of milk before a Raja Hamsa (swan) with plenty of water in it, he will take all the milk and leave the water. In that way we should take what is of value in knowledge, and leave the dross. All these intellectual gymnastics are necessary at first. We must not go blindly into anything.</p>\n\n<p>The Yogi has passed the argumentative stage, and has come to a conclusion, which is like the rocks, immovable. The only thing he now seeks to do is to intensify that conclusion. Do not argue, he say; if one forces arguments upon you, be silent. Do not answer any argument, but go away free, because arguments only disturb the mind. The only thing is to train the intellect, so what is the use of disturbing it any more. The intellect is but a weak instrument, and can give only knowledge limited by the senses; the Yogi wants to go beyond the senses; therefore the intellect is of no use to him. He is certain of this, and therefore is silent, and does not argue.&nbsp;Every argument throws his mind out of balance, creates a disturbance in the Chitta, and this&nbsp;disturbance is a drawback. These argumentations and searchings of the reason are only on the way. There are much higher things behind them. The whole of life is not for schoolboy fights and debating societies. By &ldquo;surrendering the fruits of work to God&rdquo; is to take to ourselves neither credit nor blame, but to give both up to the Lord, and be at peace.</p>\n\n<p>2. सभाणधबावनाथ् य िेशतनकू यिाथि य ॥ २॥ samadhibhavanarthah kleshatanookaranarthashch</p>\n\n<p>(They are for) the practice of Samadhi and minimising the pain-bearing obstructions.</p>\n\n<p>Most of us make our minds like spoiled children, allowing them to do whatever they want. Therefore it is necessary that there should be constant practice of the previous mortifications, in order to gain control of the mind, and bring it into subjection. The obstructions to Yoga arise from lack of this control, and cause us pain. They can only be removed by denything the mind, and holding it in check, through these various means.</p>\n\n<p>3. अणवद्याणस्मतायागिषेाणबणनवशे ा् िेशा् ॥ ३॥ avidyasmitaragadveshabhiniveshah kleshaah</p>\n\n<p>The pain-bearing obstructions are - ignorance, egoism, attachment, aversion, and clinging to life.</p>\n\n<p>4. अणवद्या ऺत्रेभ उ्त्तयषेांप्रसप्तुतनणुवणच्छिोदायािाभ ॥् ४॥ avidya kshetram uttareshan prasuptatanuvichchhinnodaranam Ignorance is the productive field of all them that follow, whether they are dormant, attenuated, overpowered, or expanded (empowered).</p>\n\n<p>5. अणनत्याशणुचदु्खानात्मसुणनत्यशणुचसखु ात्मख्याणतयणवद्या ॥ ५॥ anityashuchiduhkhanatmasu nityashuchisukhatmakhyatiravidya</p>\n\n<p>Ignorance is taking that which is non-eternal, impure, painful, and non-Self, for the eternal, pure, happy, Atman (Self).</p>\n\n<p>6. दृग्दशन य शक्त्योयके ात्मतवेाणस्मता ॥ ६॥ drigdarshanashaktyorekatmatevasmita</p>\n\n<p>Egoism is the identification of the seer with the instrument of seeing.</p>\n\n<p>7. सखु ानशुमी याग् ॥ ७॥ sukhanushayi raagah Attachment is that which dwells on pleasure.</p>\n\n<p>8. दु्खानशुमी िषे् ॥ ८॥ duhkhanushayi dveshah</p>\n\n<p>Aversion is that which dwells on pain.</p>\n\n<p>9. स्वयसवाही णवदुषोऽणऩ तथारूढोऽणबणनवशे ् ॥ ९॥ svarasavahi vidushopi tatharoodho bhiniveshah</p>\n\n<p>Flowing through its own nature, and established even in the learned, is the clinging to life.</p>\n\n<p>Even in the most learned men, who know that this body will go, and who say &ldquo;never mind: we have hundreds of bodies; the soul cannot die&rdquo;&mdash;even in them, with all their intellectual conviction, we still find this clinging to life.</p>\n\n<p>10. तेप्रणतप्रसवहमे ा् सक्ष्मू ा् ॥ १०॥ te pratiprasavaheyah sookshmah</p>\n\n<p>They, to-be-rejected-by-opposite-modifications, are fine.</p>\n\n<p>For instance, when a big wave of anger has come into the mind, how are we to control that?

They are called pain-bearing obstructions, both happy and unhappy thoughts, because according to the Yogis, both, in the long run, bring pain. All happiness which comes from the senses will, eventually, bring pain. All enjoyment will make us thirst for more, and that brings pain as its result. There is no limit to man&rsquo;s desires; he goes on desring, and when he comes to a point where desire cannot be fulfilled, the result is pain.</p>\n\n<p>13. सणत भरू ेतणिऩाको जात्यामबुोगा् ॥ १३॥ sati moole tadvipako jatyayurbhogah</p>\n\n<p>The root being there, the fruition comes (in the form&nbsp;of) species, life, and expression of pleasure and pain.</p>\n\n<p>14. तेह्लादऩणयताऩपरा् ऩण्ुमाऩण्ुमहते त्वु ात ॥् १४॥ te hladaparitapafalah punyapunyahetutvat</p>\n\n<p>They bear fruit as pleasure or pain, caused by virtue or vice.</p>\n\n<p>15. ऩणयिाभताऩसस्कं ायदु्खग ै ि युवणृत्तणवयोधाच्च दु्खभ ए्व सव ं णववणेकन् ॥ १५॥ parinamatapasanskaraduhkhairgunnavritti - virodhaccha duhkham eva sarvan vivekinah</p>\n\n<p>To the discriminating, all is, as it were, painful on account of everything bringing pain, either in the consequences, or in apprehension, or in attitude caused by impressions, also on account of the counter action of qualities.</p>\n\n<p>Even love is selfish, and the Yogi says that, in the end, we shall find that even the love of husbands and wives, and children and friends, slowly decays. Decadence seizes everything in this life.&nbsp;It is only when everything, even love, fails, that, with a flash, man finds out&nbsp;how vain, how dream-like is this world.&nbsp;Never yet was there a great soul who had not to reject sense pleasures and enjoyments to become such.</p>\n\n<p>16. हमे ंदु्खभ अ् नागतभ ॥् १६॥ heyan duhkham anagatam</p>\n\n<p>The misery which is not yet come is to be avoided.</p>\n\n<p>17. द्रष्टृदृश्ममो् समं ोगो हमे हते ्ु॥ १७॥ drashtridrishyayoh sanyogo heyahetuh</p>\n\n<p>The cause of that which is to be avoided is the&nbsp;junction of the seer and the seen.</p>\n\n<p>18. प्रकाशणिमाणस्थणतशीरंबतूणेिमात्मकं बोगाऩवगाथ य ं दृश्मभ ॥् १८॥ prakashakriyasthitishilan bhootendriyatmakan bhogapavargarthan drishyam</p>\n\n<p>The experienced is composed of elements and organs, is of the nature of illumination, action and intertia, and is for the purpose of experience and release (of the experiencer).</p>\n\n<p>The experienced, that is nature, is composed of elements and organs&mdash;the elements gross and fine which compose the whole of nature, and the organs of the senses, mind, etc., and is of the nature of illumination, action, and intertia. These are what in Sanskrit are called Sattva (illumination), Rajas (action), and Tamas (darkness); each is for the purpose of experience and relase.&nbsp;What is the purpose of the whole of nature? That the Purusa may gain experience. The Purusa has, as it were, forgotten its mighty, godly, nature.&nbsp;The Purusa does not live; it is life itself. It does not exist; it is existence itself. The Soul does not know; it is knowledge itself. It is an entire mistake to say that the Soul lives, or knows, or loves. Love and existence are not the qualities of the Purusa, but its essence.&nbsp;When they get reflected upon something you may call them the qualities of that something. But they are not the qualities of the Purusa, but the essence of this great Atman, this Infinite Being, without birth or death, Who is established in His own glory.</p>\n\n<p>You have to get all this experience, but finish it quickly. We have placed ourselves in this net, and will have to get out. We have got ourselves caught in the trap, and we will have to work out our freedom. So get this experience of husbands and wives, and friends, and little loves, and you will get through them safely if you never forget what you really are. Never forget this is only a momentary state, and that we have to pass through it.&nbsp;We have to go through these experiences, but let us never forget the ideal.</p>\n\n<p>19. णवशषेाणवशषेणरङ्गभात्राणरङ्गाणन गिुऩवाणय ि ॥ १९॥ visheshavisheshalinggamatralinggani gunnaparvani</p>\n\n<p>The states of the qualities are the defined, the undefined, the indicated only, and the signless.</p>\n\n<p>According to the Sankhyas, nature is both the material and efficient cause of this universe. In this nature there are three sorts of materials, the Sattva, the Rajas, and the&nbsp;Tamas. The Tamas material is all that is dark, all that is ignorant and heavy; and the Rajas is activity. The Sattvas is calmness, light. When nature is in the state before creation, it is called by them Avyaktam, undefined, or indiscrete; that is, in which there is no distinction of form or name, a state in which these three materials are held in perfect balance. Then the balance is disturbed, these different materials begin to mingle in various fashions, and the result is this universe. In every man, also, these three materials exist.&nbsp;When the Sattva material prevails knowledge comes. When the Rajas material prevails activity comes, and when the Tamas material prevails darkness comes and lassitude, idleness, ignorance. According to the Sankhya theory, the highest manifestation of this nature, consisting of these three materials, is what they call Mahat, or intelligence, universal intelligence, and each human mind is a part of that cosmic intelligence.&nbsp;Then out of Mahat comes the mind. In the Sankhya Psychology there is a sharp distinction between Manas, the mind function, and the function of the Buddhi intellect. The mind function is simply to collect and carry impressions and present them to the Buddhi, the individual Mahat, and the Buddhi determined upon it. So, out of Mahat comes mind, and out of mind comes fine material, and this fine material combines and becomes the gross material outside&mdash;the external universe. The claim of the Sankhya philosophy is that beginning with the intellect, and coming down to a block of stone, all has come out of the same thing, only as finer or grosser states of existence.&nbsp;The Buddhi is the finest state of existence of the materials, and then comes Ahamkara, egoism, and next to the mind comes fine material, which they call Tanmatras, which cannot be seen, but which are inferred.&nbsp;These Tanmatras combine and&nbsp;become grosser, and finally produce this universe. The finer is the cause, and the grosser is the effect. It begins with the Buddhi, which is the finest material, and goes on becoming grosser and grosser, until it becomes this universe.&nbsp;According to the Sankhya philosophy, beyond the whole of this nature is the Purusa, which is not material at all. Purusa is not at all similar to anything else, either Buddhi, or mind, or the Tanmatras, or the gross material; it is not akin to any one of these, it is entirely separate, entirely different in its nature, and from this they argue that the Purusa must be immortal, because it is not the result of combination. That which is not the result of combination cannot die, these Purusas or Souls are infinite in number.&nbsp;Now we shall understand the Aphorism, that the states of the qualities are defined, undefined, and signless. By the defined is meant the gross elements, which we can sense. By the undefined is meant the very fine materials, the Tanmatras, which cannot be sensed by ordinary men. If you practice Yoga, however, says Patanjali, after a while your perception will become so fine that you will actually see the Tanmatras. For instance, you have heard how every man has a certain light about him; every living being is emanating a certain light, and this, he says, can be seen by the Yogi. We do not all see it, but we are all throwing out these Tanmatras, just as a flower is continuously emanating these Tanmatras, which enable us to smell it.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;the indicated only&rdquo; means the Buddhi, the intellect. &ldquo;The indicated only&rdquo; is the first manifestation of nature; from it all other manifestations proceed.</p>\n\n<p>The last is &ldquo;the signless.&rdquo;&nbsp;out of intelligence comes what we call gross matter. Modern philosophers say that intelligence is the last to come. They say that unintelligent things slowly evolve into animals, and from animals slowly evolve into men. They claim that instead of everything coming out of intelligence, intelligence is itself the last to come. Both the religious and the scientific statement, though seemingly directly opposed to each other, are true.&nbsp;Take an infinite series A&mdash;B&mdash;A&mdash;B&mdash;A&mdash;B, etc. The question is which is first, A or B. If you take the series as A&mdash;, you will say that A is first, but if you take it as B&mdash;A you will say that B is first. It depends on the way you are looking at it.&nbsp;Intelligence evolves, and becomes the gross material, and this again evolves as intelligence, and again evolves as matter once more.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Indian philosophy, however, goes beyond both intelligence and matter, and finds a Purusa, or Self, which is beyond all intelligence, and of which intelligence is but the borrowed light.</p>\n\n<p>20. द्रष्टा दृणशभात्र् शद्धुोऽणऩ प्रत्यमानऩुश्म् ॥ २०॥ drashta drishimatrah shuddhopi pratyayanupashyah</p>\n\n<p>The seer is intelligence only, and though pure, seen through the colouring of the intellect.</p>\n\n<p>Certainly intelligence is manufactured, and that very fact shows us that there must be something beyond that, because it cannot be free. Everything connected with matter is in nature, and therefore bound for ever. Who is free? That free one must certainly be beyond cause and effect.&nbsp;If you say that the idea of freedom is a delusion, I will say that the idea of bondage is also a delusion.&nbsp;If one idea is a delusion, the other is also a delusion, because both stand upon the same basis&mdash;consciousness. The Yogi says both are true; that we are bound so far as intelligence goes, that we are free as far as the soul is concerned.&nbsp;Intelligence has no light of its own. Each organ has a particular centre in the brain; it is not that all the organs have one centre; each organ is separate. Why do all these perceptions harmonise, and where do they get their unity? If it were in the brain there would be one centre only for the eyes, the nose, the ears, while we know for certain that there are different centres for each. But a man can see and hear at the same time, so a unity must be back of intelligence.&nbsp;Intelligence is eternally connected with the brain, but behind even intelligence stands the Purusa, the unit, where all these different sensations and perceptions join and become one.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>21. तदथ य एव दृश्मस्यात्मा ॥ २१॥ tadarth eva drishyasyatma</p>\n\n<p>The nature of the experience is for him.</p>\n\n<p>22. कृताथ ं प्रणत नष्टभप्यनष्टंतदन्यसाधायित्वात ॥् २२॥ kritarthan prati nashtam apyanashtan tadanyasadharannatvat</p>\n\n<p>Though destroyed for him whose goal has been gained, yet is not destroyed, being common to others.</p>\n\n<p>23. स्वस्वाणभशक्त्यो् स्वरूऩोऩरणब्धहते ्ुसमं ोग् ॥ २३॥ svasvamishaktyoh svaroopopalabdhihetuh sanyogah</p>\n\n<p>Junction is the cause of the realisation of the nature of&nbsp;both the powers, the experienced and its Lord.</p>\n\n<p>24. तस्य हते युणवद्या ॥ २४॥ tasya heturavidya</p>\n\n<p>Ignorance is its cause.</p>\n\n<p>25. तदबावात स् मं ोगाबावो हानंतद्दृश्े क ै वल्यभ ॥् २५॥ tadabhavat sanyogabhavo hanan taddrisheh kaivalyam</p>\n\n<p>There being absence of that (ignorance) there is absence of junction, which is the thing-to-be-avoided; that is the independence of the seer.</p>\n\n<p>26. णववके ख्याणतयणवप्लवा हानोऩाम् ॥ २६॥ vivekakhyatiraviplava hanopayah</p>\n\n<p>The means of destruction of ignorance is unbroken practice of discrimination.</p>\n\n<p>27. तस्य सप्तधा प्रान्तबणूभ् प्रऻा ॥ २७॥ tasya saptadhaa prantabhoomih prajna</p>\n\n<p>His knowledge is of the sevenfold highest ground.</p>\n\n<p>The first to appear will be that we have known what is to be known.
