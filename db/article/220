Personally I don&#39;t find psychological studies very intriguing because most of the psychological studies are done in academic settings which does not facilitate the variation that is present in the real world, and the interaction among people in real world is much more complex. Also, notably most of the psychological studies are just re-iteration of ancient wisdom. Plus, nowadays cultures are interacting more than previous times, things are changing very fast, so any conclusion regarding psychology is not more than speculation, which sometimes can be useful, other times just speculation. It&#39;s also interesting to note that Eastern philosophy, in particular, aims to get rid of psychological problems by getting rid of course concept of self altogether.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Psychologists have spent a lot of time figuring out concept of &#39;self&#39; that everyone has, it is one of the most researched subjects.</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#8e44ad;\"><strong><u>Spotlight Effect &amp; Illusion of transparency</u></strong></span>: <a href=\"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/254298057_The_Social_Spotlight_Increases_Blindness_to_Change_Blindness\" target=\"_blank\">Timothy Lawson (2010)</a>, <a href=\"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/12609065_The_Spotlight_Effect_in_Social_Judgment_An_Egocentric_Bias_in_Estimates_of_the_Salience_of_One's_Own_Actions_and_Appearance\" target=\"_blank\">Gilovich &amp; others, 2000</a></p>\n\n<p><strong>Generally,</strong> people might be not focussing on you as much as you might think; on you, on your attire, on your petty mistakes, on your emotional expressions of irritation, disgust, <strong>anxiety</strong> etc. <em>You are not the spotlight.</em></p>\n\n<p>If you are nervous about being nervous, don&#39;t be.

We may, therefore, privately take some pleasure in a peer&rsquo;s failure, especially when it happens to someone we envy and when we don&rsquo;t feel vulnerable to such misfortune ourselves (Lockwood, 2002; Smith &amp; others, 1996).<br />\nSocial comparisons can also diminish our satisfaction.</p>\n\n<p>When climbing the ladder of success, we tend to look up, not down; we compare ourselves with others doing even better (Gruder, 1977; Suls &amp; Tesch, 1978; Wheeler &amp; others, 1982). When facing competition, we often protect our shaky self-concept by perceiving the competitor as advantaged. For example, college swimmers believed that their competitors had better coaching and more practice time (Shepperd &amp; Taylor, 1999).</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#27ae60;\">[IF YOUR SENSE OF SELF IS SO MUCH DEPENDENT ON OTHERS, IS IT REALLY YOU?

When shown drawings of groups of children, Japanese students took the facial expressions of all the children into account when rating the happiness or anger of an individual child, whereas<br />\nAmericans focused only on the child they were asked to rate (Masuda &amp; others, 2008).

In one study, 60 percent of American students said they had seriously dated someone even though their friends disliked him or her, compared to only 27 percent of Chinese students.

Threaten our personal identity and we&rsquo;ll feel angrier and gloomier than when someone threatens our collective identity (Gaertner &amp; others, 1999).</p>\n\n<p>Unlike Japanese, who persist more on tasks when they are failing (wanting not to fall short of others&rsquo; expectations), people in individualistic countries persist more when succeeding, because success elevates self-esteem (Heine &amp; others, 2001).</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>&ldquo;ONE NEEDS TO CULTIVATE THE SPIRITS OF SACRIFICING THE LITTLE ME TO ACHIEVE THE BENEFITS OF THE BIG ME.&rdquo;<br />\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &mdash;CHINESE SAYING</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>In collectivists conformity is normal and not something undesirable.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>&ldquo;IN SOOTH, I KNOW NOT WHY I AM SO SAD.&rdquo;<br />\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &mdash;WILLIAM SHAKESPEARE, THEMERCHANT OF VENICE, 1596</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>People may misattribute their rainy-day gloom to life&rsquo;s emptiness (Schwarz &amp; Clore, 1983).

Or would the likelier results be divorce, job burnout, and holiday disappointment?</p>\n\n<p>Studies show that we are bad at predicting future feelings as well. Julie Woodzicka and Marianne LaFrance (2001), Gilbert &amp; Ebert, 2002; Loewenstein &amp; Schkade, 1999</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>&ldquo;WHEN A FEELING WAS THERE, THEY FELT AS IF IT WOULD NEVER GO; WHEN IT WAS GONE, THEY FELT AS IF IT HAD NEVER BEEN;<br />\n&nbsp; WHEN IT RETURNED, THEY FELT AS IF IT HAD NEVER GONE.&rdquo;<br />\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &mdash; George Macdonald, what&rsquo;s mine&rsquo;s mine, 1886</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><strong>impact bias:</strong> Overestimating the enduring impact of emotion-causing events. Wilson and Gilbert (2005)</p>\n\n<p>If people overestimate the intensity and the duration of the pleasure they will gain from purchasing a new car or undergoing cosmetic surgery, then they may make ill-advised investments in that new Mercedes or extreme makeover.</p>\n\n<p>In focusing on the negative event, we discount the importance of everything else that contributes to happiness and so overpredict our enduring misery. &ldquo;Nothing that you focus on will make as much difference as you think,&rdquo; write researchers David Schkade and Daniel Kahneman (1998)</p>\n\n<p>Moreover, say Wilson and Gilbert (2003), people neglect the speed and the power of their psychological immune system, which includes their strategies for rationalizing, discounting, forgiving, and limiting emotional trauma.</p>\n\n<p>Ironically, as Gilbert and colleagues report (2004), major negative events (which activate our psychological defenses) can be less enduringly distressing than minor irritations (which don&rsquo;t activate our defenses).</p>\n\n<p>We are aware of results of mental processes rather than the processes themselves.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>&ldquo;SELF-CONTEMPLATION IS A CURSE THAT MAKES AN OLD CONFUSION WORSE.&rdquo;<br />\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &mdash; Theodore Roethke, the collected poems of theodore roethke, 1975&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><strong>dual attitude system:</strong> Differing implicit (automatic) and explicit (consciously controlled) attitudes toward the same object. Verbalized explicit attitudes may change with education and persuasion; implicit attitudes change slowly, with practice that forms new habit. (Gawronski &amp; Bodenhausen, 2006; Nosek, 2007)</p>\n\n<p>The sincerity with which people report and interpret their experiences is no guarantee of the validity of those reports.</p>\n\n<p><strong>self-esteem:</strong> A person&rsquo;s overall self-evaluation or sense of self-worth.</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;One person may have self-esteem that is highly contingent on doing well in school and being physically attractive, whereas another may have self-esteem that is contingent on being loved by God and adhering to moral standards. Thus, the first person will feel high self-esteem when made to feel smart and good-looking, the second person when made to feel moral. Jennifer Crocker and Connie Wolfe (2001)</p>\n\n<p>&quot;People who value themselves in a general way&mdash;those with high self-esteem&mdash;are more likely to value their looks, abilities, and so forth. They are like new parents who, loving their infant, delight in the baby&rsquo;s fingers, toes, and hair: The parents do not first evaluate their infant&rsquo;s fingers or toes and then decide how much to value the whole baby.&quot; Jonathon Brown and Keith Dutton (1994)</p>\n\n<p>Feedback is best when it is true and specific (Swann &amp; others, 2007). Doing well at math makes you think you are good at math, which then motivates you to do even better. So if you want to encourage someone (or yourself!), it&rsquo;s better if your praise is specific (&ldquo;You&rsquo;re good at math&rdquo;) instead of general (&ldquo;You&rsquo;re great&rdquo;) and if your kind words reflect true ability and performance (&ldquo;You really improved on your last test&rdquo;) rather than unrealistic optimism (&ldquo;You can do anything&rdquo;).</p>\n\n<p>It can also have negative effects. Forsyth &amp; others, 2007. Struggling students told to feel good about themselves, the researchers muse, may have thought, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m already great&mdash;why study?&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p><strong>What happens when your self-esteem is threatened&mdash;for example, by a failure or an unflattering comparison with someone else?</strong></p>\n\n<p>When brothers have markedly dif- ferent ability levels&mdash;for example, one is a great athlete and the other is not&mdash;they report not getting along well (Tesser, 1988).</p>\n\n<p>Self-esteem threats also occur among friends, whose success can be more threatening than that of strangers (Zuckerman &amp; Jost, 2001).</p>\n\n<p>Your level of self-esteem also makes a difference: High self-esteem people usually react to a self-esteem threat by compensating for it (blaming someone else or trying harder next time). These reactions help them preserve their positive feelings about themselves. Low self-esteem people, however, are more likely to &ldquo;break&rdquo; by blaming themselves or giving up (VanDellen &amp; others, 2011).</p>\n\n<p>Studies confirm that social rejection lowers our self-esteem and makes us more eager for approval. Spurned or jilted, we feel unattractive or inadequate. Like a blinking dashboard light, this pain can motivate action self-improvement and a search for acceptance and inclusion elsewhere.</p>\n\n<p><strong>terror management:</strong> theory proposes that people exhibit self-protective emotional and cognitive responses (including adhering more strongly to their cultural worldviews and prejudices) when confronted with reminders of their mortality. If self-esteem were only about acceptance, he counters, why do &ldquo;people strive to be great rather than to just be accepted&rdquo;?</p>\n\n<p>People with low self-esteem often have problems in life&mdash;they make less money, abuse drugs, and are more likely to be depressed (Salmela-Aro &amp; Nurmi, 2007; Trzesniewski &amp; others, 2006).</p>\n\n<p>But sometimes a correlation between two variables is sometimes caused by a third factor. Maybe people low in self-esteem also faced poverty as children, experienced sexual abuse, or had parents who used drugs&mdash;all possible causes of later struggling.</p>\n\n<p>High self-esteem does have some benefits&mdash;it fosters initiative, resilience, and pleasant feelings (Baumeister &amp; others, 2003). Yet teen males who engage in sexual activity at an &ldquo;inappropriately young age&rdquo; tend to have higher than average self-esteem. So do teen gang leaders, extreme ethnocentrists, terrorists, and men in prison for committing violent crimes (Bushman &amp; Baumeister, 2002; Dawes, 1994, 1998). &ldquo;Hitler had very high self-esteem,&rdquo; note Baumeister and co-authors (2003).</p>\n\n<p>NARCISSISM: SELF-ESTEEM&rsquo;S CONCEITED SISTER</p>\n\n<p>Narcissists usually have high self-esteem, but they are missing the piece about caring for others (Campbell &amp; others, 2002).</p>\n\n<p>Although narcissists are often outgoing and charming early on, their self-centeredness often leads to relationship problems in the long run ( Campbell, 2005). The link between narcissism and problematic social relations led Delroy Paulhus and Kevin Williams (2002) to include narcissism in &ldquo;<strong>The Dark Triad</strong>&rdquo; of negative traits, along with Machiavellianism (manipulativeness) and antisocial psychopathy.</p>\n\n<p>Narcissim and high self-esteem combined has correlation with aggression. Bushman &amp; others, 2009;</p>\n\n<p>Narcissism can be collective (in groups) as well. Golec deZavala &amp; others, 2009</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>&ldquo;My conclusion is that self-control is worth 10 times as much as self-esteem.&rdquo;&mdash; ROY BAUMEISTER, 2005</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The findings linking a highly positive self-concept with negative behavior exist in tension with the findings that people expressing low self-esteem are more vulnerable to assorted clinical problems, including anxiety, loneliness, and eating disorders.</p>\n\n<p>When feeling bad or threatened, low-self-esteem people often take a negative view of everything. They notice and remember others&rsquo; worst behaviors and think their partners don&rsquo;t love them (Murray &amp; others, 1998, 2002; Ybarra, 1999). Although there is no evidence that low-self-esteem people choose less desirable partners, they are quick to believe that their partners are criticizing or rejecting them. Perhaps as a result, low-self-esteem people are less satisfied with their relationships (Fincham &amp; Bradbury, 1993). They may also be more likely to leave those relationships. Low-self-esteem undergraduates decided not to stay with roommates who saw them in a positive light (Swann &amp; Pelham, 2002).</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>&ldquo;There is nothing noble in being superior to some other person. The true nobility is in being superior to your previous self.&rdquo; - An Indian Proverb</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Self-Control:</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>People who exert self-control&mdash;by forcing themselves to eat radishes rather than chocolates, or by suppressing forbidden thoughts&mdash;subsequently quit faster when given unsolvable puzzles.</li>\n\t<li>People who have tried to control their emotional responses to an upsetting movie exhibit decreased physical stamina.</li>\n\t<li>People who have spent their willpower on tasks such as controlling their emotions during an upsetting film later become more aggressive and more likely to fight with their partners (DeWall &amp; others, 2007; Finkel &amp; Campbell, 2001).</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Self-control therefore operates similarly to muscular strength, conclude Baumeister and Julie Exline (2000): Both are weaker after exertion, replenished with rest, and strengthened by exercise.</p>\n\n<p><strong>self-efficacy:</strong> A sense that one is competent and effective, distinguished from self-esteem, which is one&rsquo;s sense of self-worth. A sharpshooter in the military might feel high self-efficacy and low self-esteem.</p>\n\n<p>Believing in our own competence and effectiveness pays dividends (Bandura &amp; others, 1999; Maddux and Gosselin, 2003).</p>\n\n<p>Competence plus persistence equals accomplishment. And with accomplishment, self-confidence grows. Self-efficacy, like self-esteem, grows with hard-won achievements. When problems arise, a strong sense of self-efficacy leads workers to stay calm and seek solutions rather than ruminate on their inadequacy.</p>\n\n<p>Even subtle manipulations of self-efficacy can affect behavior. Becca Levy (1996)</p>\n\n<p>If you believe you can do something, will that belief necessarily make a difference? That depends on a second factor: Do you have control over your outcomes? You may, for example, feel like an effective driver (high self-efficacy) yet feel endangered by drunken drivers (low control). You may feel like a competent student or worker but, fearing discrimination based on your age, gender, or appearance, you may think your prospects for success are dim.</p>\n\n<p>Some people seemed to persistently &ldquo;feel that what happens to them is governed by external forces of one kind or another, while others feel that what happens to them is governed largely by their own efforts and skills&rdquo; (quoted by Hunt, 1993, p. 334)</p>\n\n<p><strong>locus of control:</strong> The extent to which people perceive outcomes as internally controllable by their own efforts or as externally controlled by chance or outside forces.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>&ldquo;ARGUE FOR YOUR LIMITATIONS, AND SURE ENOUGH THEY&rsquo;RE YOURS.&rdquo;<br />\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &mdash; Richard Bach, Illusions: adventures of a reluctant messiah, 1977</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Some people, however, have taken these ideas a little too far. The popular book The Secret, for example, claims that thinking positive thoughts causes positive things to happen to you (&ldquo;The only reason any person does not have enough money is because they are blocking money from coming to them with their thoughts&rdquo;).</p>\n\n<p><strong>learned helplessness:</strong> The sense of hopelessness and resignation learned when a human or animal perceives no control over repeated bad events.</p>\n\n<p>Depressed or oppressed people, for example, become passive because they believe their efforts have no effect. Helpless dogs and depressed people both suffer paralysis of the will, passive resignation, and even motionless apathy.</p>\n\n<p>Personal-Control can help reduce health problems.</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>Prisoners given some control over their environments&mdash;by being able to move chairs, control TV sets, and operate the lights&mdash;experience less stress, exhibit fewer health problems, and commit less vandalism (Ruback &amp; others, 1986; Wener &amp; others, 1987).</li>\n\t<li>Workers given leeway in carrying out tasks and making decisions experience improved morale (Miller &amp; Monge, 1986). So do telecommuting workers who have more flexibility in balancing their work and personal life (Valcour, 2007).</li>\n\t<li>In all countries studied, people who perceive themselves as having free choice experience greater satisfaction with their lives. And countries where people experience more freedom have more satisfied citizens (Inglehart &amp; others, 2008).</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>However excess choice and freedom also has negative effects. Barry Schwartz (2000, 2004) (Iyengar &amp; Lepper, 2000) Making choices is tiring.</p>\n\n<p>Christopher Hsee and Reid Hastie (2006) illustrate how choice may enhance regret. Give employees a free trip to either Paris or Hawaii and they will be happy. But give them a choice between the two and they may be less happy. People who choose Paris may regret that it lacks the warmth and the ocean. Those who choose Hawaii may regret the lack of great museums.</p>\n\n<p>Ironically, people like and will pay for the freedom to reverse their choices. Yet, note Daniel Gilbert and Jane Ebert (2002), that same freedom &ldquo;can inhibit the psychological processes that manufacture satisfaction.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>That principle may help explain a curious social phenomenon (Myers, 2000a): National surveys show that people expressed more satisfaction with their marriages several decades ago when marriage was more irrevocable (&ldquo;all purchases final&rdquo;). Today, despite greater freedom to escape bad marriages and try new ones, people tend to express somewhat less satisfaction with the marriage that they have.</p>\n\n<p>If your initial efforts to lose weight, stop smoking, or improve your grades succeed, your self-efficacy increases. This has been used in design of games to make you addict.</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;Praising all the children just for being themselves,&rdquo; they contend, &ldquo;simply devalues praise.&rdquo; Better to praise and bolster self-esteem &ldquo;in recognition of good performance. . . . As the person performs or behaves better, self-esteem is encouraged to rise, and the net effect will be to reinforce both good behavior and improvement. Those outcomes are conducive to both the happiness of the individual and the betterment of society.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p><strong>self-serving bias:</strong> The tendency to perceive oneself favorably.</p>\n\n<p><strong>self-serving:</strong> attributions A form of self-serving bias; the tendency to attribute positive outcomes to oneself and negative outcomes to other factors.</p>\n\n<p>Ironically, we are even biased against seeing our own bias. People claim they avoid self-serving bias themselves but readily acknowledge that others commit this bias (Pronin &amp; others, 2002) (Pronin &amp; Ross, 2006).</p>\n\n<p>People see themselves in more light. Researchers have wondered: Do people really believe their above-average self-estimates? Is their self-serving bias partly a function of how the questions are phrased (Krizan &amp; Suls, 2008)? When Elanor Williams and Thomas Gilovich (2008) had people bet real money when estimating their relative performance on tests, they found that, yes, &ldquo;people truly believe their self-enhancing self-assessments.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p><strong>Illusory optimism:</strong></p>\n\n<p>Studies of more than 90,000 people across 22 cultures reveal that most humans are more disposed to optimism than pessimism (Fischer &amp; Chalmers, 2008). Indeed, many of us have what researcher Neil Weinstein (1980, 1982) terms &ldquo;an unrealistic optimism about future life events.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>In a 2006&ndash;2008 worldwide poll, most people expected their lives to improve more in the next 5 years than they did in the past 5 years (Deaton, 2009)&mdash;an especially striking expectation considering the world-wide recession that followed.</p>\n\n<p>According to a study (Lench &amp; others, 2006), parents assumed their children would be more likely to complete college, remain healthy, and stay happy.</p>\n\n<p>In perhaps the most wide-ranging example, many home buyers, mortgage lenders, and investors in the mid-2000s displayed unrealistic optimism in their belief that &ldquo;housing never goes down,&rdquo; accumulating large amounts of debt. The eventual result was a wave of home foreclosures that spawned the 2007&ndash;2009 recession, the most severe economic downturn since the Great Depression. For illusory optimism, we often pay a price.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>&ldquo;O GOD, GIVE US GRACE TO ACCEPT WITH SERENITY THE THINGS THAT CANNOT BE CHANGED, COURAGE TO CHANGE THE THINGS WHICH SHOULD BE CHANGED, AND THE WISDOM TO DISTINGUISH THE ONE FROM THE OTHER.&rdquo; &mdash; Reinhold Niebuhr, The Serenity Prayer, 1943</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><strong>false uniqueness effect:</strong> The tendency to underestimate the commonality of one&rsquo;s abilities and one&rsquo;s desirable or successful behaviors. Goethals &amp; others, 1991, Spears &amp; others, 2009, we may see our failings as relatively normal and our virtues as relatively exceptional.</p>\n\n<p>Are the biased perceptions, then, simply a perceptual error, an emotion-free glitch in how we process information? Or are self-serving motives also involved? It&rsquo;s now clear from research that we have multiple motives. Questing for self-knowledge, we&rsquo;re motivated to assess our competence (Dunning, 1995). Questing for self-confirmation, we&rsquo;re motivated to verify our self-conceptions (Sanitioso &amp; others, 1990; Swann, 1996, 1997). Questing for self affirmation, we&rsquo;re especially motivated to enhance our self-image (Sedikides, 1993). Self-esteem motivation, then, helps power our self-serving bias. As social psychologist Daniel Batson (2006) surmises, &ldquo;The head is an extension of the heart.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>Self-esteem has its dark side, but also its bright side. When good things happen, people with high self-esteem are more likely to savor and sustain the good feelings (Wood &amp; others, 2003). &ldquo;Believing one has more talents and positive qualities than one&rsquo;s peers allows one to feel good about oneself and to enter the stressful circumstances of daily life with the resources conferred by a positive sense of self,&rdquo; noted Shelley Taylor and co-researchers (2003b). Self-serving bias and its accompanying excuses also help protect people from depression (Snyder &amp; Higgins, 1988; Taylor &amp; others, 2003a). Non-depressed people usually exhibit self-serving bias. They excuse their<br />\nfailures on laboratory tasks or perceive themselves as being more in control than they are. Depressed people&#39;s self-appraisals and their appraisals of how others really view them are not inflated.</p>\n\n<p><strong>group-serving bias:</strong> Explaining away outgroup members&rsquo; positive behaviors; also attributing negative behaviors to their dispositions (while excusing such behavior by one&rsquo;s own group).</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>&ldquo;VICTORY FINDS A HUNDRED FATHERS BUT DEFEAT IS AN ORPHAN.&rdquo;<br />\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &mdash; COUNT GALEAZZO CIANO, THE CIANO DIARIES, 1938</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;OTHER SINS ARE BEFORE OUR EYES; OUR OWN ARE BEHIND OUR BACK.&rdquo;<br />\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &mdash; SENECA, DE IRA, A . D . 43</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>&ldquo;FALSE HUMILITY IS THE PRETENSE THAT ONE IS SMALL. TRUE HUMILITY IS THE CONSCIOUSNESS OF STANDING IN THE PRESENCE OF GREATNESS.&rdquo;<br />\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &mdash; JONATHAN SACKS, BRITAIN&rsquo;S CHIEF RABBI, 2000</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>In literature, the pitfalls of pride are portrayed again and again. In theology, pride has long been first among the &ldquo;seven deadly sins.&rdquo;<br />\nIf pride is akin to the self-serving bias, then what is humility? Is it self-contempt? Humility is not handsome people believing they are ugly and smart people trying to believe they are slow-witted. False modesty can actually be a cover for pride in one&rsquo;s better-than-average humility. (James Friedrich [1996] reports that most students congratulate themselves on being better than average at not thinking themselves better than average!) True humility is more like self-forgetfulness than false modesty. It leaves us free to recognize accurately and rejoice in our special talents and, with the same honesty, to recognize the talents of others.</p>\n\n<p><strong>self-handicapping:</strong> Protecting one&rsquo;s self-image with behaviors that create a handy excuse for later failure. Steven Berglas and Edward Jones (1978)</p>\n\n<p>Sometimes people sabotage their chances for success by creating impediments that make success less likely.</p>\n\n<p>Can you see why, fearing failure, people might handicap themselves by partying half the night before a job interview or playing video games instead of studying before a big exam? When self-image is tied up with performance, it can be more self-deflating to try hard and fail than to procrastinate and have a ready excuse.</p>\n\n<p>After losing to some younger rivals, tennis great Martina Navratilova confessed that she was &ldquo;afraid to play my best. . . . I was scared to find out if they could beat me when I&rsquo;m playing my best because if they can, then I am finished&rdquo; (Frankel &amp; Snyder 1987).</p>\n\n<p><strong>self-presentation:</strong> The act of expressing oneself and behaving in ways designed to create a favorable impression or an impression that corresponds to one&rsquo;s ideals.</p>\n\n<p>To varying degrees, we are continually managing the impressions we create. Whether we wish to impress, intimidate, or seem helpless, we are social animals, playing to an audience. So great is the human desire for social acceptance that it can lead people to risk harming themselves through smoking, binge eating, pre-mature sex, or drug and alcohol abuse (Rawn &amp; Vohs, 2011).</p>\n\n<p>Social interaction is a careful balance of looking good while not looking too good.</p>\n\n<p>In familiar situations, self-presentation happens without conscious effort. In unfamiliar situations, perhaps at a party with people we would like to impress or in conversation with someone we have romantic interest in, we are acutely self-conscious of the impressions we are creating and we are therefore less modest than when among friends who know us well (Leary &amp; others, 1994; Tice &amp; others, 1995).</p>\n\n<p>Social networking sites such as Facebook provide a new and sometimes intense venue for self-presentation. They are, says communications professor Joseph Walther, &ldquo;like impression management on steroids&rdquo; (Rosenbloom, 2008). Users make careful decisions about which pictures, activities, and interests to highlight in their profiles. Some even think about how their friends will affect the impression they make on others; one study found that those with more attractive friends were perceived as more attractive themselves (Walther &amp; others, 2008). Given the concern with status and attractiveness on social networking sites, it is not surprising that people high in narcissistic traits thrive on Facebook, tallying up more friends and choosing more attractive pictures of themselves (Buffardi &amp; Campbell, 2008).</p>\n\n<p><strong>self-monitoring:</strong> Being attuned to the way one presents oneself in social situations and adjusting one&rsquo;s performance to create the desired impression.</p>\n\n<p>For some people, conscious self-presentation is a way of life. Those who score high on a scale of self- monitoring (who, for example, agree that &ldquo;I tend to be what people expect me to be&rdquo;) act like social chameleons&mdash;they adjust their behavior in response to external situations (Gangestad &amp; Snyder, 2000; Snyder, 1987). Having attuned their behavior to the situation, they are more likely to espouse attitudes they don&rsquo;t really hold (Zanna &amp; Olson, 1982).</p>\n\n<p>Presenting oneself in ways that create a desired impression is a delicate balancing act. People want to be seen as able but also as modest and honest (Carlston &amp; Shovar, 1983). In most social situations, modesty creates a good impression, unsolicited boasting a bad one. Hence the false modesty phenomenon: We often display lower self-esteem than we privately feel (Miller &amp; Schlenker, 1985). But when we have obviously done extremely well, the insincerity of a disclaimer (&ldquo;I did well, but it&rsquo;s no big deal&rdquo;) may be evident. To make good impressions&mdash;to appear modest yet competent&mdash;requires social skill.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>&ldquo;PUBLIC OPINION IS ALWAYS MORE TYRANNICAL TOWARDS THOSE WHO OBVIOUSLY FEAR IT THAN TOWARDS THOSE WHO FEEL INDIFFERENT TO IT.&rdquo;<br />\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &mdash;BERTRAND RUSSELL, THE CONQUEST OF HAPPINESS, 1930</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>An example of how your self is shaped unconsciously: You become part of a group somehow, the group stands up for something, you have to take part in it, while doing that you said something that&#39;s not even your idea rather group&#39;s idea and belief, later you justify what you said, gradually you start believing in the same idea.
