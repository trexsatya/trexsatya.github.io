You are allowed to perform three types of operations on string A. You can either delete a character from A, or you can insert a character into A, or substitute a character in A with some other character.</p>\n\n<p>You want to find out how many minimum operations are required to convert string A into B?</p>\n\n<hr />\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>First applying the framework of problem-solving that I have mentioned <a href=\"http://satyendra.online/#/article/117\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>.</p>\n\n<p><em>Deducing from What We Have:</em><br />\n&nbsp; &nbsp; Fill In The Blanks:</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; E.g. the problem doesn&#39;t talk about length, but it&#39;s implcitily there.</p>\n\n<p><em>Examples:</em><br />\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Unique:</p>\n\n<p><br />\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Extreme:</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>(Re)Building The Situation:<br />\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;How did this problem evolve;<br />\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;E.g. start from empty string for this problem<br />\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Instead of starting from ground up, you could also (re)build by referring to what is the most recent state that may have led to the current situation.</p>\n\n<p><br />\nReduce:<br />\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;This and previous are highly linked.<br />\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;E.g. you can reduce on the size of the arguments<br />\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;- size of first string<br />\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;- size of second string<br />\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;- number of operations (what if only one operation was allowed?)</p>\n\n<p>Resemblance:<br />\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;It&#39;s very hard to find resemblance by logical methods.
