You are trying to explain to your boss that there was a lot of traffic which caused your lateness. But your boss says that it&#39;s not traffic, but your lack of responsibility and preparedness.&nbsp;<br />\nLater some time, somehow a project came to your company <em>(mostly because the client was in dire need to hire someone as soon as possible due to some circumstances)</em>, but your boss thinks and portrays that it&#39;s his skills that brought the project onboard.&nbsp;</div>\n\n<p><br />\nIn the first scenario, you are attributing the event&nbsp;(reaching office late) to external factors: <strong>Situational Attribution</strong>; and&nbsp;your boss is attributing the same event&nbsp;to internal factors&nbsp;(virtues of person): <strong>Dispositional Attribution</strong><br />\nHowever, in the second scenario, your boss is attributing the event (success) to his internal factors.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>People when they (or their beloved people) are at stake, often attribute positive events to Dispositions and negative events to Situations. People when someone else (not their beloved ones) are at stake, often attribute positive events to Situations and negative events to Dispositions. (<strong><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fundamental_attribution_error\">Fundamental Attribution Error</a>&nbsp;and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultimate_attribution_error\">Ultimate Attribution Error</a></strong>). In simple sentences:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>I succeeded because of my passion, hard work.</p>\n\n<p>I failed because of the situations and luck.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Meta-analysis of Attribution Error:&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Western culture focuses more on the self-made person rather than the group, hence they are more prone to this error than Eastern people.<br />\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; <em>So this Fundamental Error is &quot;fundamental&quot; more in the west than east.</em>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<hr />\n<h2>Attitude and Behaviour<br />\n&nbsp;</h2>\n\n<div style=\"background:#eeeeee;border:1px solid #cccccc;padding:5px 10px;\">When asked &quot;Do you care about the environment? Do you think we need to be careful towards the environment?&quot;, you answer Yes, but many a time, you know that plastics are bad for the environment and still, you would have used and thrown plastic&nbsp;bag.</div>\n\n<p><br />\nThis is an example of inconsistency between Attitude and Behavior.</p>\n\n<p>This inconsistency may be caused by Situational factors, but it is common that people believe something else, but do something else.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Does Attitude decide Behavior, always?</strong></p>\n\n<p>No, sometimes Behavior alters person&#39;s attitude. This is explored in <a href=\"#\">Cognitive Dissonance</a>.</p>\n\n<h3>Self-Fulfilling Prophecy (a.k.a. <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confirmation_bias\">Confirmation Bias</a>, My-Side Bias):</h3>\n\n<p><cite><q>Look, all the shreds of evidence are on my side, they support what I thought!!</q></cite></p>\n\n<p>Even smart people (including scientists, philosophers, psychologists) are susceptible to biased information search, biased interpretation, biased memory, and biased deduction/reasoning to arrive at a conclusion that supports their belief (existing cognitions).</p>\n\n<div style=\"background:#eeeeee;border:1px solid #cccccc;padding:5px 10px;\">I know that most men&mdash;not only those considered clever, but even those who are very clever, and capable of understanding most difficult scientific, mathematical, or philosophic problems&mdash;can very seldom discern even the simplest and most obvious truth if it be such as to oblige them to admit the falsity of conclusions they have formed, perhaps with much difficulty&mdash;conclusions of which they are proud, which they have taught to others, and on which they have built their lives.<sup id=\"cite_ref-75\"><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confirmation_bias#cite_note-75\">[73]</a>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</sup>-&nbsp; Leo Tolstoy&nbsp;(in his essay&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/What_Is_Art%3F\" title=\"What Is Art?\">What Is Art?</a>&quot;)</div>\n\n<p><br />\nHave you seen people who think that they know something when actually they do not know much about it? They are kind of in an illusion, feeling superior.</p>\n\n<p>There is also something called &quot;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunning%E2%80%93Kruger_effect\">Dunning-Kruger Effect</a>&quot; which explains this behavior. It&#39;s quite similar to My-Side Bias because they gain little knowledge/idea/theory and due to Confirmation Bias form a belief that they are right. It may arise from either lack of knowledge, misconception, misinterpretation, combined with a nature/sense of superiority.</p>\n\n<h2><br />\nPersuasion</h2>\n\n<p>Apart from <em>prominent</em>&nbsp;( as per the target&#39;s perception) benefits, what are the things that influence how easily you persuade your audience/target?</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Source effect: has to do with Speaker: his credibility, attractiveness, power</li>\n\t<li>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Message: humor, fear-appeal, informational,&nbsp;</li>\n\t<li>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Channel: in-person, television, magazine</li>\n\t<li>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Receiver: Age, gender, interest-level</li>\n</ul>\n\n<div style=\"background:#eeeeee;border:1px solid #cccccc;padding:5px 10px;\">Everybody is doing something (X) around you, how long would you be able to hold yourself from doing that? Does that change if there is someone else who is not doing X?</div>\n\n<p><br />\nWhen you give in because &quot;<em>everybody is doing it that way</em>&quot;<br />\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Sometimes people are able to defy the consensus (however that comes at some cost; a bit of stressful feeling that &quot;<em>I might be the one who is wrong here because everybody is doing it that way</em>&quot;)<br />\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;But over the period defiance becomes more difficult. This is called <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asch_conformity_experiments\">Conformance</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Results from Meta-analysis of many Ash-Style Conformance studies:</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Women tend to conform somewhat more than men.</li>\n\t<li>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Conformity levels have (overall) declined since the 1950s</li>\n\t<li>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Conformity increases as the majority size increases from 2 people to 13 people.</li>\n\t<li>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Conformity increases when the majority is formed of ingroup members than the outgroup members.</li>\n\t<li>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Collectivist countries like Japan show higher rates of conformity than individualist countries like America. (strongest factor). In Japan&nbsp;like cultures, people see conformity as cooperation, harmony, tactfulness.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<div style=\"background:#eeeeee;border:1px solid #cccccc;padding:5px 10px;\">Okay, so majority has an effect on the minority. But, does minority have any effect on the majority?</div>\n\n<p><br />\nYes, it can have a substantial effect, given that the minority is consistent.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conversion_theory_of_minority_influence\">Moscovici&#39;s study</a>.</p>\n\n<p><strong><u>The Dark Sides of Social Conformity, Obedience</u></strong></p>\n\n<p>Book:&nbsp;<a href=\"http://psycnet.apa.org/record/1971-08069-001\">The Human Choice: Individuation, Reason, and Order vs Deindividuation, Impulse, and Chaos.</a></p>\n\n<p>When behavior becomes unrestrained, wild, violent leading to lynching, molestation, group rape etc. as seen in many historical instances like Waco Horror, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Holocaust\">The Holocaust</a></p>\n\n<div style=\"background:#eeeeee;border:1px solid #cccccc;padding:5px 10px;\"><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lynching_of_Jesse_Washington\">Waco Horror</a>: Jessie Washington in Texas on 1916 lynched by the mob. 10000 people present including mayor, police, children, fingers, and toes cut, was&nbsp;hanged over a bonfire.</div>\n\n<p><br />\n<strong>Deindividuation</strong>: Loss of self-awareness and evaluation-apprehension; occurs in group situations that foster responsiveness to group norms, good or bad.</p>\n\n<p>Meta-Analysis of Deindividuation:<br />\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &quot;<em>Larger groups either induce or facilitate stronger antinormative behavior.</em>&quot;<br />\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Here the gender difference is insignificant.</p>\n\n<p>Anonymity, Diffused responsibility (<em>that I am not responsible for this</em>), Group size, group activity, physical and mental arousal, sensory input overload, physical involvement, altered state of consciousness (e.g. effect of drugs) are factors for Deindividuation</p>\n\n<p>Resources:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/359194.The_Lucifer_Effect\">The Lucifer Effect: How Good People Turn Evil</a>&nbsp;<br />\n&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<a href=\"http://prisonexp.org/\">http://prisonexp.org/</a></p>\n\n<h3>Group Dynamics</h3>\n\n<p>Group Thinking / Brainstorming:&nbsp;brainstorming together doubles the productivity.

We are made from an accumulation of things from the environment which is shared among everyone.&nbsp; Still, we think categorically of ourselves me, them, white, black, male, female,...because it&#39;s useful in most cases.

But in some cases like in the male-female situation, <q><cite>Men are all the same</cite></q>, <q><cite>Women are all the same</cite></q>, there is something more than lack of contact. In ingroup (the group that you are part of), they organize and recall information in terms of persons rather than the abstract characteristics.<br />\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Ingroup Bias (favoring the in-group, even when you are not actually against outgroup) is observed generally. Partly because Social Identity and because people expect support only from the ingroup.<br />\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;People with high self-esteem are more bound to social identity and hence more susceptible to Ingroup Bias than people with low self-esteem.<br />\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Compensation of own&#39;s self-esteem is sometimes done by downsizing others (Prejudice).&nbsp; Example, if you have just received a bad job review, and someone asks you &quot;Are females less competent in the workplace?&quot;, you are more likely to say yes.</p>\n\n<p>People prejudge outgroup members based on:</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><u><em>Just</em>-world attribution in an <em>unjust</em> world</u>:&nbsp;Assumption that <q><cite>people get what they deserve, and deserve what they get</cite></q>&nbsp;-&nbsp;this makes people blame poor people for being impoverished, and to some extent, are more likely to blame women for getting battered or raped.</li>\n\t<li><u>Fundamental Attribution Error</u>:&nbsp;People attribute events and behavior more likely to dispositions than to situations. Sometimes this continues to be the case even when people are presented with obvious proof against their belief.</li>\n\t<li><u>Ultimate Attribution Error</u>:&nbsp;Ingroup members attribute<br />\n\t&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;(1) negative outgroup behavior to dispositional causes (more than they would for identical ingroup behavior)<br />\n\t&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;(2) positive outgroup behavior to fluke/exceptional-case, luck/special-advantage, high-motivation-and-effort, situational-factors.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Is this bad?
