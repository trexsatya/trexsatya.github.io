{"name":"Parental Psychology","id":151,"content":"<p>Book: Adult Children of Immature Parents</p>\n\n<hr />\n<p>These are the characteristics of immature parents.</p>\n\n<ol>\n\t<li>They want exclusive attention in conversation and in general. They are ego-centric.</li>\n\t<li>They use emotional contagion as communication method. Rather than discussing emotional state in a mature way, they behave like child and act in a way that spreads their anxiety, their sadness across the home.</li>\n\t<li>They don&#39;t try to understand emotions. They don&#39;t want to do <em>Emotional Labour</em>.</li>\n\t<li>They want it, but they are hard to give to. Again a childish behavior.</li>\n\t<li>They want <em>mirroring</em> - sometimes they want to see their children in the same rut they are in.</li>\n\t<li>Their self-esteem rides on your compliance.</li>\n\t<li>They see roles as sacred. E.g. they will enforce that I am the father, I can do whatever I want to keep the family in the way that I want. Or like, the mother of the child is responsible for certain tasks etc. They wouldn&#39;t like to take wise advice from their children.</li>\n\t<li>They seek enmeshment, not emotional intimacy. Enmeshment and Intimacy look similar, but are completely different. In enmeshment, two immature people seek identity and self completion through intense, dependent relationship. In intimacy, two mature adults come in relationship for mutual acceptance and support.</li>\n\t<li>They have an inconsistent sense of time - they don&#39;t learn from past, don&#39;t anticipate future.</li>\n\t<li>&nbsp;</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Immature parents lie on the extreme ends of the spectrum of: Emotion, Control, Affection, Involvement</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n","authorId":null,"subject":"psychology","tags":null,"img":null,"summary":null,"lastUpdated":"2020-06-21T05:15:42.021+0000"}
