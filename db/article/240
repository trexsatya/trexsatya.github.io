Don&rsquo;t you know the old proverb, &ldquo;You spoil wine, when you pour water into it&rdquo;?</p>\n\n<p><i>Democritus.</i>&nbsp;Yes, then you spoil both the water and the wine.</p>\n\n<p><i>Polaemon.</i>&nbsp;I would rather spoil them both than be spoiled by one of them.</p>\n\n<p>....</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;When you drink, you treat wine as you like. When you have drunk, it will treat you as it likes.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>....................................</p>\n\n<p><i>Cirr.</i>&nbsp;Does it seem to you to be time to go to school?</p>\n\n<p><i>Praet.</i>&nbsp;Certainly, it is time to go.</p>\n\n<p><i>Cirr.</i>&nbsp;I don&rsquo;t properly remember the way; I believe we have to go through this next street.</p>\n\n<p><i>Praet.</i>&nbsp;How often have you already been to the school?</p>\n\n<p><i>Cirr.</i>&nbsp;Three or four times.</p>\n\n<p><i>Praet.</i>&nbsp;When did you first go?</p>\n\n<p><i>Cirr.</i>&nbsp;As I think, three or four days ago.</p>\n\n<p><i>Praet.</i>&nbsp;Well, now; isn&rsquo;t that enough to enable you to know the way?</p>\n\n<p><i>Cirr.</i>&nbsp;No, not if it were a hundred times of going.</p>\n\n<p><i>Praet.</i>&nbsp;Why, if I were to go once, never afterwards should I miss the way. But you go, against your will, and as you go, you stop and play. You don&rsquo;t look at the way, nor at the houses, nor any signs which would show you afterwards which way you should turn, or which way you should follow. But I observe all these points diligently, because I go gladly.</p>\n\n<p>...................................</p>\n\n<p><em>[Vive&#39;s method of teaching vowels and consonants]</em></p>\n\n<p>Take the A B C tablet in your left hand, and this pointer in the right hand, so that you can point out the letters one by one.</p>\n\n<p>Stand upright; put your cap under your arm-pit.</p>\n\n<p><i>Praec.</i>&nbsp;Take the A B C tablet in your left hand, and this pointer in the right hand, so that you can point out the letters one by one. Stand upright; put your cap under your arm-pit. Listen most attentively how I shall name these letters. Look diligently how I move my mouth. See that you return what I say immediately in the same manner, when I ask for it again. Attention (<em>sis mecum</em>)! Now you have heard it. Follow me now as I say it before you, letter by letter. Do you clearly understand?</p>\n\n<p><i>Lus.</i>&nbsp;It seems to me I do, fairly well.</p>\n\n<p><i>Letters&mdash;Syllables&mdash;Vowel&mdash;Speech</i></p>\n\n<p><i>Praec.</i>&nbsp;Every one of these signs is called a letter. Of these, five are vowels, A, E, I, O, U. They&nbsp;<a id=\"Page_19\" name=\"Page_19\">19</a>are in the Spanish&nbsp;<em>oveia</em>, which signifies&nbsp;<em>sheep</em>. Remember that word! These with any letter you like, or more than one, make up syllables. Without a vowel there is no syllable and sometimes the vowel itself is a syllable. Therefore all the other letters are called consonants, because they don&rsquo;t constitute sounds by themselves unless a vowel is joined to them. They have some imperfect, maimed (<em>mancum</em>) sound,&nbsp;<i>e.g.</i>&nbsp;<i>b</i>,&nbsp;<i>c</i>,&nbsp;<i>d</i>,&nbsp;<i>g</i>, which without&nbsp;<i>e</i>&nbsp;cannot be sounded. Out of syllables we get words, and from words connected speech, which all beasts lack. And you would not be different from the beasts, if you could not converse properly. Be watchful and perform your work diligently. Go out with your fellow-pupils and learn what I have set.</p>\n\n<p><i>Lus.</i>&nbsp;We are not playing to-day.</p>\n\n<p><i>Aesch.</i>&nbsp;No, for it is a work-day. What, do you think you have come here to play? This is not the place for playing, but for study.</p>\n\n<p><i>Lus.</i>&nbsp;Why, then, is a school called&nbsp;<em>ludus</em>?</p>\n\n<p><i>True Leisure</i></p>\n\n<p><i>Aesch.</i>&nbsp;It is indeed called&nbsp;<em>ludus</em>, but it is&nbsp;<em>ludus literarius</em>, because here we must play with letters as elsewhere with the ball, hoop, and dice. And I have heard that in Greek it is called&nbsp;<em>schola</em>, as it were a place of leisure, because it is true ease and quiet of mind, when we spend our life in studies. But we will learn thoroughly what the teacher has bidden us, quite in soft&nbsp;murmur, so that we don&rsquo;t become a hindrance to one another.</p>\n\n<p><i>Lus.</i>&nbsp;My uncle, who studied letters some time in Bologna, has taught me that you better fix anything you wish in the memory if you pronounce it aloud. This is also confirmed by the authority of one called Pliny&mdash;I don&rsquo;t know who he was.</p>\n\n<p><i>Aesch.</i>&nbsp;If, then, any one should wish to learn his&nbsp;<em>formulae</em>, he should go off into the garden or into the churchyard. There he can shout aloud as if he would rouse the dead.</p>\n\n<p><i>Cotta.</i>&nbsp;You boys, do you call this learning thoroughly? I call it prattling and disputing! Up, now go all of you to the teacher, as he commanded.</p>\n\n<p>...</p>\n\n<p><i>Corn.</i>&nbsp;What do you call this first one?</p>\n\n<p><i>Tull.</i>&nbsp;A.</p>\n\n<p><i>Corn.</i>&nbsp;Why is this first one rather than the next called A?</p>\n\n<p><i>Mother.</i>&nbsp;Why art thou Corneliola and not Tulliolus?</p>\n\n<p><i>Corn.</i>&nbsp;Because I am so called.</p>\n\n<p><i>Mother.</i>&nbsp;And it is just the same way with those letters. But go and play now, my boy.</p>\n\n<p>.....</p>\n\n<p><i>Nep.</i>&nbsp;Are you bathed in luxury (<em>vivitisne laut&egrave;?</em>) living here?</p>\n\n<p><i>Piso.</i>&nbsp;What do you mean by that? Do we wash ourselves (<em>an lavamur</em>)? Every day, hands and face, and indeed, frequently, for cleanliness of body is conducive to health and to nurture.</p>\n\n<p><i>Nep.</i>&nbsp;That is not what I ask&mdash;but whether you get food and drink to your mind?</p>\n\n<p><a id=\"Page_27\" name=\"Page_27\">27</a></p>\n\n<p><i>Piso.</i>&nbsp;We don&rsquo;t eat according to our desire, but according to the call of the palate.</p>\n\n<p><i>Nep.</i>&nbsp;I ask, if you eat, as you wish.</p>\n\n<p><i>Piso.</i>&nbsp;Certainly, forsooth, as hunger dictates. Who wishes to eat, eats; who does not wish, abstains.</p>\n\n<p><i>Nep.</i>&nbsp;Do you go from the table hungry?</p>\n\n<p><i>Piso.</i>&nbsp;By no means sated. For this is not wise. For it is the part of beasts, not men, to glut themselves. They say that a certain wise king never sat down to table without hunger, and never stood up sated.</p>\n\n<p><i>Nep.</i>&nbsp;What do you eat, then?</p>\n\n<p><i>Piso.</i>&nbsp;What there is.</p>\n\n<p><i>Nep.</i>&nbsp;Oh! I was thinking that you eat what you hadn&rsquo;t got! But what is there, then?</p>\n\n<p><i>Piso.</i>&nbsp;Troublesome questioner! What they give us.</p>\n\n<p><i>Nep.</i>&nbsp;But what do they give you, then?</p>\n\n<p><i>Piso.</i>&nbsp;We have breakfast an hour and a half after we have got up.</p>\n\n<p><i>Nep.</i>&nbsp;When do you get up?</p>\n\n<p><i>Piso.</i>&nbsp;Almost with the sun, for he is the leader of the Muses and the Muses are gracious to the dawn. Our early breakfast is a piece of coarse bread and some butter or some fruit as the time of the year supplies. For lunch, there are cooked vegetables or pottage in pottage-vessels, and&nbsp;meat with relishes. Sometimes turnips, sometimes cabbages, starch-food, wheat-meal, or rice. Then on fish-days, buttermilk from butter which has been turned out in deep dishes, with some cakes of bread, and a fresh fish, if it can be bought fairly cheap in the fish-market, or if not, a salt-fish, well soaked. Then pease, or pulse, or lentils, or beans, or lupines.</p>\n\n<p><i>Nep.</i>&nbsp;How much of these does each get?</p>\n\n<p><i>Piso.</i>&nbsp;Bread as much as he wishes; of viands as much as is necessary not for satiety, but for nourishment. For elaborate feasts, you must seek elsewhere, not in the school, where the aim is to form minds to the way of virtue.</p>\n\n<p><i>Nep.</i>&nbsp;What, then, do you drink?</p>\n\n<p><i>Piso.</i>&nbsp;Some drink fresh, clear water; others light beer; some few, but only seldom, wine, well diluted. The afternoon meal (<em>merenda</em>) or before-meal consists of some bread and almonds or nuts, dried figs and raisins; in summer, of pears, apples, cherries, or plums.</p>\n\n<p>But when we go into the country for the sake of our minds (recreation), then we have milk, either fresh or congealed, fresh cheese, cream, horse-beans soaked in lye, vine-leaves, and anything else which the country house&nbsp;<a id=\"Page_29\" name=\"Page_29\">29</a>affords. The chief meal begins with a salad with closely-cut bits, sprinkled with salt, moistened with drops of olive-oil, and with vinegar poured on it.</p>\n\n<p><i>Nep.</i>&nbsp;Can you have nut or turnip oil?</p>\n\n<p><i>Piso.</i>&nbsp;Ugh! the unsavoury and unhealthy stuff! Then there is in a great vessel a concoction of mutton broth with sauce, and to it, dried plums, roots, or herbs as supplements, and at times a most savoury pie.</p>\n\n<p><i>Nep.</i>&nbsp;What sort of sauces do you have?</p>\n\n<p><i>Piso.</i>&nbsp;The best and wisest of sauces, hunger. Besides, on appointed week-days we get roasted meat&mdash;as a rule, veal; in spring sometimes, some young kid. As an after-dish a little bit of radish and cheese, not old and decayed, but fresh cheese, which is more nourishing than the old, pears, peaches, and quinces. On the days on which no meat may be eaten, we have eggs instead of meat, either broiled, fried, or boiled, either singly by themselves or mingled in one pan with vinegar or oil, not so much poured on as dropped in; sometimes a little fish, and nuts follow on cheese.</p>\n\n<p><i>Nep.</i>&nbsp;How much does every one get.</p>\n\n<p><i>Piso.</i>&nbsp;Two eggs and two nuts.</p>\n\n<p><i>Nep.</i>&nbsp;What! do you never have a sleeping draught after supper?</p>\n\n<p><i>Piso.</i>&nbsp;Pretty often.</p>\n\n<p><a id=\"Page_30\" name=\"Page_30\">30</a></p>\n\n<p><i>Nep.</i>&nbsp;What do you have, I beg? for that is most delightful.</p>\n\n<p><i>Piso.</i>&nbsp;We prepare a banquet such as that of Syrus mentioned by Terence, or of one of the lordly people mentioned by Athenaeus or of the like, of which the record has been handed down in history. Do you think us swine or men? What stomach would preserve its soundness of health if after four meals it were to add a drinking-bout? Observe you are in a school, not in an eating-house. For they say there is nothing more ruinous to health than to drink immediately before going to bed.</p>\n\n<p><i>Nep.</i>&nbsp;May I be allowed to be present at meal-time?</p>\n\n<p><i>Piso.</i>&nbsp;Certainly. Only I must first beg permission from the teacher, who will, I am sure, give it without difficulty, as is usual with him.</p>\n\n<p>To take you to the banquet, without the master&rsquo;s permission, would be ill breeding; and he who should so bring you would draw on himself from his fellow-disciples nothing less than reproach and shame. Stop a minute. Will you, sir, permit with your good favour, that a certain boy known to me should be present at our meal?</p>\n\n<p><i>Praec.</i>&nbsp;Certainly. There will be no harm in it.</p>\n\n<p><i>Piso.</i>&nbsp;Thank you. He whom thou seest there, who has a napkin in place of a neck-cloth is the feast-master of the dining-room (<em>architriclinus</em>) this week&mdash;for here we have weekly feast-masters, like kings.</p>\n\n<p><i>Feast-Master.</i>&nbsp;Lamia, what time is it?</p>\n\n<p><i>Lamia.</i>&nbsp;I have not heard the hours since the third, being intent on the composition of a letter. Florus will know this better than I, for he has not seen book or paper the whole of the afternoon.</p>\n\n<p><i>Florus.</i>&nbsp;This is friendly testimony, and if the teacher were angry, it would have great weight. But how couldst thou observe me, being immersed, as thou sayest, in the composition of a letter? Clearly ill-will has driven thee to telling a lie. I rejoice, indeed, that my enemy is held to be a liar. If after this he shall wish to say evil of me, such statements will not be believed.</p>\n\n<p><i>Feast-Master.</i>&nbsp;Can I not then, elsewhere, get to know as to the time? Anthrax, run across to St. Peter&rsquo;s and look at the time.</p>\n\n<p><i>Anthrax.</i>&nbsp;The pointer shows that it is now six o&rsquo;clock.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n", "authorId": 1, "subject": "philosophy", "tags": [], "img": "", "summary": "", "lastUpdated": "2021-09-12 15:38:33.277170"}
