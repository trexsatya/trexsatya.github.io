{"name":"Bitcoins","id":158,"content":"<p><strong>Where does Money come from?</strong></p>\n\n<p>Wealth of The Nation is the money that the nation owes to the rest of the world, which is never going to be paid back.</p>\n\n<p>When a Government spends more money than it collects through the taxes, then it either borrows more or creates more.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>PAST: Initially money was backed by Gold, for every dollar of money there was some gold reserved worth a dollar.</p>\n\n<p>PRESENT: Govt creates Bonds or T-Bills, these bonds are sold in market (this generates funds), large banks buy these bonds and sells them to Federal Reserve at profit. Federal Reserve is America&#39;s central bank. Federal Reserve does not have any cash (even on balance sheets). When a bank sells bonds to Fed, the Principal and profit just appears in banks account.&nbsp; (This is a secret process). Federal Reserve is not a govt agency, its private entity and its shareholders are banks (some of these banks are the same that sell out the Govt bonds). The banks name is secret.</p>\n\n<p>If central bank releases more money into economy, prices rise (nearly 2% p.a.)</p>\n\n<p>Banks do not actually have cash with them. When you give a hundred dollar to bank, bank keeps $3 and lends $97 to someone else with a promise that the person will pay back. Now bank has your $100 + lent $97 in its account. This process is called Fractional Reserve Banking.</p>\n\n<p>So Money is not physical, its Virtual. Banks don&#39;t even need someone to deposit money, they can just issue you a credit card and start charging you interest to generate money.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>SO THE THING IS THAT WE ALREADY HAVE BEEN USING DIGITAL CURRENCY RIGHT FROM BEGINNING.</p>\n\n<p><strong>So how does&nbsp;Bitcoin comes different?</strong></p>\n\n<p>Bitcoin itself is not currency, its a protocol. Currency is just one of its application.</p>\n\n<p>Bitcoin has three&nbsp;distinctions : No central governing/controlling body, Anonymity, Zero Transaction Cost.</p>\n\n<p>If Bitcoin is just a bunch of digits, how is it safe? What if someone copies it and spends in two (or more) places at the same time? This problem is solved by digitally signing those digits and ensuring that it is used only once. How is it ensured? - By cutting it off the list. Who does this? - Everyone that is doing bitcoin mining.</p>\n\n<p>A ledger is made public to every bitcoin miner, they all verify this ledger and send back. Now everyone is sending it back, which one is finalized? - Its kind of lottery. How can we be sure that miner is doing the validation correctly and is not forging. Because it is costly to validate this and the winner of lottery gets reward for it.</p>\n\n<p>The ledger itself is called Blockchain.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n","authorId":null,"subject":"finance","tags":null,"img":null,"summary":null,"lastUpdated":null}
