{"name":"Philosophy of Quantum Theory in Physics","id":146,"content":"<h2>What is Quantum Mechanics?</h2>\n\n<p>Let&#39;s start from basics.</p>\n\n<p>Physical systems: Aything that we can see / measure, having different parts which are physical themselves. There are some measurable properties for any physical system, simplest examples of such properties would be length, width, speed etc.</p>\n\n<p>State: At a given moment of time, a complete specification of all the properties that can change with time.</p>\n\n<p>For measurement, we use mathematical objects to represent these properties, which can be integers, or real numbers etc.</p>\n\n<p>Quantum Mechanics :&nbsp; started with Work of Plank, Einstein inadvertantly contributed to it.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;Schrodinger developed equations which set the foundation of QM.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp; What is Quantum Mechanics?<br />\n&nbsp; &nbsp; - A framework to do physics; i.e. to understand how physical systems work.<br />\n&nbsp; &nbsp; - This framework can be applied to different disciplines; the same rules work e.g. Quantum Electrodynamics = QM applied to Electrodynamics.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp; QM has replaced classical physics.</p>\n\n<p><br />\n&nbsp; QM follows Linearity.<br />\n&nbsp; QM requires Complex numbers, it&#39;s not optional as it is in classical physics.<br />\n&nbsp; QM is not deterministic.<br />\n&nbsp; Superposition is unusual; unlike classical physics<br />\n&nbsp; Quantum entanglement.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp; Schrodinger equation is linear.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;i.h.D(psi,t) = H(psi)</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;Linearity means that if you replace the operands in an equation which is solution, the modified equation is a solution as well. E.g. derivative function is a Linear operator, while square function is not.<br />\n&nbsp; &nbsp;Complex numbers: have a real part and an imaginary part.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;Einstein reluctantly came up with idea that light is made of photons. That a beam of light is billions of photons, each having very little energy. E=hv<br />\n&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Eye can detect even 4-5 photons in dark.<br />\n&nbsp; &nbsp;All these photons of light beam are identical as per our understanding.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;Let&#39;s do an experiment now.<br />\n&nbsp; &nbsp; We have a Polarizer. Which is something like glass, from which light gets passed through either completely or gets absorbed depending on the angle it has been shot.<br />\n&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; E.g. if beam is sent at 0 degree along x-axis, it passes through, but if shot at 90 degrees to x-axis, it gets absorbed.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; Now shoot individual photons, we notice that some get absorbed, and some pass through. This is very unusual, because if photons are all identical, they all should behave in the same way, either all pass through or all get absorbed.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; People did many experiments, and confirmed that it&#39;s not that this happens because of Polarizer&#39;s structure.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp; People proposed that &quot;Maybe photons are not at all identical, there&#39;s some hidden variable, which if we could know, would fix this problem&quot;.<br />\n&nbsp; &nbsp; But John Bell showed mathematically, with his Bell Inequalities, that even if we found that hidden variable, would not make QM Deterministic.<br />\n&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; He basically showed that if hidden variables exist, there would be an experiment which would satisfy Bell Inequalities. But later on, with development of technology, people performed those experiments and found that it didn&#39;t hold the Bell&#39;s equation, meaning there are no hidden variables.<br />\n&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br />\n&nbsp; All we have is probabilities, we can predict probabilities of whether photon gets through or not.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />\n&nbsp; State == Vector == Wave Function&nbsp;<br />\n&nbsp; Space = Vector of parameters.<br />\n&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />\n&nbsp; SUPERPOSITION IN QM IS DIFFERENT THAN CLASSICAL PHYSICS.<br />\n&nbsp; In CP, when you superimpose two states, you get a state with intermediate properties. E.g. superimpose two electrical fields constructively, you get electrical field with intermediate measurements.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp; In QM, it is different. superimpose 2 states A, B =&gt; alpha.A + beta.B =&gt; But you either get A or B, you don&#39;t get intermediate measurement. But if you experiment many times, you can find probabilities of getting A or B.<br />\n&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; alpha, beta here are complex numbers generally.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp; Superimposing a state onto itself has no physical effect.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp; All elementary particles are supposed to have a &quot;spin&quot;, they have an angular momentum even if they are not revolving around something, as if they are rotating always on themselves. Nobody has constructed a model as how it exactly works, why do they have momentum.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp; If you superimpose spin states, they also show that for a given measurement, the spin is either completely up or down. You just have probabilities.<br />\n&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />\n&nbsp; Einstein&#39;s Paradox here:&nbsp;<br />\n&nbsp; &nbsp; You are saying that the particles were in Quantum state. And then you measure it and find probabilities that 40% were measured to be in up state, 60% in down state. How do yo know that it was not a mix of 40% particles in up state, and 60% particles in down state, right from the beginning before you mesaured it?<br />\n&nbsp; It turned out later on that there are experiments which can clarify the doubt here.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp; So, in QM state of superposition, the particles are in both up and down state at the same time, only when you measure it, you see them in either up or down state.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp; ENTANGLED STATES:<br />\n&nbsp; A QM state, you cannot tell what particle 1 is doing, and separately tell what particle2 is doing. because they are inter-dependent, even when they are 100&#39;s of km apart.<br />\n&nbsp; E.g. you have a particle, and your friend has a particle, and they are in entangled state, then even if you are 100&#39;s of kms apart, if you measure your particle and find that it has &quot;up&quot; spin, instanteniously your friend&#39;s particle will go in &quot;down&quot; state.<br />\n&nbsp; &nbsp; People speculated that in this case information can be sent to other place with a speed faster than light, violating the Special Relativity theory.&nbsp;<br />\n&nbsp; &nbsp; But it is not so.&nbsp;<br />\n&nbsp; Einstein objected to this as well. But Bell showed that if you and your friend measure in 3 different directions, they will find correlations that are impossible to explain with classical physics.</p>\n\n<p><br />\n&nbsp; &quot;Physics is information, when you say something about a physical system, you given information, mostly in the form of numbers&quot; - Leonard Susskind, Stanford lecture. https://youtu.be/0Eeuqh9QfNI<br />\n&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />\n&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br />\n&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n","authorId":null,"subject":"philosophy","tags":null,"img":null,"summary":null,"lastUpdated":"2018-07-01T13:59:25.154+0000"}
