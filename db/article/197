People have done a lot of research on the&nbsp;historical life of Buddha, and his life is as&nbsp;much of&nbsp;mystery as that of Socrates (original greatest philosopher in West)]</em></p>\n\n<p>No anger, resentment, agitation, hatred, antagonism, the displeasure of mind in general&nbsp;on dispraise; No joy, gladness, exhilaration of mind on praise. Just factual analysis: Is it accurate/inaccurate?&nbsp;What&#39;s in it for me?</p>\n\n<p>The way of life of contemplative Gotama:</p>\n\n<ol>\n\t<li>No killing. Instead be merciful, compassionate for the welfare of all living beings.</li>\n\t<li>No stealing</li>\n\t<li>No sexual act (which is villager&#39;s way)</li>\n\t<li>No false speech. Hold to truth, firm, reliable no deceiver of the world.</li>\n\t<li>No divisive speech. No talk that seeds the idea of separation among different groups.</li>\n\t<li>No abusive speech. Use words that are soothing to hear, affectionate, go to the&nbsp;heart, polite, appealing and pleasing to people at large.</li>\n\t<li>No idle chatter. Speak in season, reason, according to the goal, the Dhamma, and the Vinaya.&nbsp;speaks words worth treasuring, seasonable, reasonable, circumscribed, connected with what is profitable&nbsp;<em>[attha].&rsquo;</em></li>\n\t<li>No damaging seed and plant life.&nbsp;</li>\n\t<li>No evening meal and meal at the wrong time of day.</li>\n\t<li>No singing, dancing, instrumental music, watching shadows. No&nbsp;heedless &amp; idle games...</li>\n\t<li>No garlands, beautification, scent, cosmetics.</li>\n\t<li>No luxurious beds and seats.</li>\n\t<li>Do not accept gold and money.</li>\n\t<li>Do not accept&nbsp;uncooked grain&hellip; raw meat&hellip; women &amp; girls&hellip; male &amp; female slaves&hellip; goats &amp; sheep&hellip; fowl &amp; pigs&hellip; elephants, cattle, steeds, &amp; mares&hellip; fields &amp; property.&rsquo;&hellip;</li>\n\t<li>No mutilating, executing, imprisoning, highway robbery, plunder, &amp; violence.&rsquo;</li>\n\t<li>No running messages&hellip; from buying &amp; selling&hellip; from dealing with false scales, false metals, &amp; false measures&hellip; from bribery, deception, &amp; fraud.&rsquo;&hellip;</li>\n\t<li>No talking on animal topics:&nbsp;talking about kings, robbers, ministers of state; armies, alarms, and battles; food and drink; clothing, furniture, garlands, and scents; relatives; vehicles; villages, towns, cities, the countryside; women and heroes; the gossip of the street and the well; tales of the dead; tales of diversity [philosophical discussions of the past and future], the creation of the world &amp; of the sea, and talk of whether things exist or not.</li>\n\t<li>No debates over doctrines and philosophies.</li>\n\t<li>No animal arts: palmistry, reading signs &amp; omens, interpreting dreams, horoscope, astrology, phrenology, giving protective charms, making predictions, forecasting&nbsp;etc..</li>\n\t<li>Do not earn&nbsp;living by accounting, counting, calculation, composing poetry, or teaching hedonistic arts &amp; doctrines etc...</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>The Tathagata discerns the following logic and reasoning and yet doesn&#39;t grasp at it,&nbsp;And as he is not grasping at it, unbinding&nbsp;<em>[nibbuti]</em>&nbsp;is experienced right within. Knowing, as they have come to be, the origination, ending, allure, &amp; drawbacks of feelings, along with the escape from feelings, the Tath\u0101gata, through lack of clinging/sustenance&mdash;is released.</p>\n\n<ol>\n\t<li>And although beings transmigrate, wander on, die, &amp; reappear, there still is that which is for eternity.&nbsp;Why is that? Because I&mdash;through ardency, through exertion, through commitment, through heedfulness, through right attention&mdash;touch an awareness-concentration such that in my concentrated mind&mdash;purified, bright, unblemished, rid of defilement&mdash;I remember many past lives.&nbsp;By means of this I know how the self &amp; the cosmos are eternal, barren, stable as a mountain-peak, standing firm like a pillar. And although beings transmigrate, wander on, die, &amp; reappear, there still is that which is for eternity.</li>\n\t<li>Cosmos and self are eternal, one eon, two eons, ... of cosmic contraction &amp; expansion. why? - by same as above.</li>\n\t<li>Cosmos and self are eternal, ten eons, twenty eons, ... of cosmic contraction &amp; expansion.&nbsp;why? -&nbsp;by same as above.</li>\n\t<li>Cosmos and self are eternal, why? - by logic, reasoning!</li>\n\t<li>We were created by Brahm\u0101, the Great Brahm\u0101, the Conqueror, the Unconquered, the All-Seeing, All-Powerful, the Sovereign Lord, the Maker, Creator, Chief, Appointer and Ruler, Father of All That Have Been and Shall Be. He is constant, permanent, eternal, not subject to change, and will remain just like that for eternity. But we who have been created by him&mdash;inconstant, impermanent, short-lived, subject to falling&mdash;have come to this world.&nbsp;<br />\n\tCosmos evolves and devolves.&nbsp;\n\t<p id=\"dn1sec5\">There ultimately comes a time when, with the passing of a long stretch of time, this cosmos devolves. When the cosmos is devolving, beings, for the most part, head toward the Radiant (brahm\u0101s). There they stay: mind-made, feeding on rapture, self-luminous, coursing through the air, established in beauty for a long stretch of time. Then there ultimately comes a time when, with the passing of a long stretch of time, this cosmos evolves. When the cosmos is evolving, an empty Brahm\u0101 palace appears. Then a certain being&mdash;from the exhaustion of his life span or the exhaustion of his merit &mdash; falls from the company of the Radiant and re-arises in the empty Brahm\u0101 palace. And there he still stays mind-made, feeding on rapture, self-luminous, coursing through the air, established in beauty for a long stretch of time.</p>\n\n\t<p>&ldquo;After dwelling there alone for a long time, he experiences displeasure &amp; agitation: &lsquo;O, if only other beings would come to this world!&rsquo;</p>\n\n\t<p>&ldquo;Then other beings, through the ending of their life span or the ending of their merit, fall from the company of the Radiant and reappear in the Brahm\u0101 palace, in the company of that being. And there they still stay mind-made, feeding on rapture, self-luminous, coursing through the air, established in beauty for a long stretch of time.</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p>Devas corrupted by Play, laughter, fall from divine place to this world. Those who are not corrupted will remain there constantly. Why? - Because these fallen devas achieve awareness and recollect past lives to find so.</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p>Devas corrupted by Mind. They spend an excessive amount of time staring at one another. They fall from the divine company.&nbsp;hose who are not corrupted will remain there constantly. Why? - Because these fallen devas achieve awareness and recollect past lives to find so.</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p>Partially eternal and partially non-eternal cosmos and self, based on logic, reasoning.</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p>This cosmos is finite, encircled. Why is that? Because I&hellip; have attained an awareness-concentration such that I remain with the perception of &ldquo;finite&rdquo; with regard to the cosmos.</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p>This cosmos is infinite, unencircled. Why is that? Because I&hellip; have touched an awareness-concentration such that I remain with the perception of &ldquo;infinite&rdquo; with regard to the cosmos.</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p>The cosmos is finite &amp; infinite.&nbsp;Why is that? Because I&hellip; have attained an awareness-concentration such that I remain with the perception of &ldquo;finite&rdquo; with regard to the cosmos above &amp; below, but with the perception of &ldquo;infinite&rdquo; all around.&nbsp;</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p>The cosmos is neither finite nor infinite. Purely based on logic, reasoning.</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p>&ldquo;This is skillful,&rdquo; or that &ldquo;This is unskillful.&rdquo; I cannot declare any of that, as that would be a falsehood on my part. Out of <strong><em>fear</em></strong> of falsehood, they evade such questions and make verbal contortions like &#39;I don&rsquo;t think so. I don&rsquo;t think in that way. I don&rsquo;t think otherwise. I don&rsquo;t think not. I don&rsquo;t think not not.&#39;</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p>&ldquo;This is skillful,&rdquo; or that &ldquo;This is unskillful.&rdquo; I cannot declare any of that, as that would be a desire, passion, clinging on my part. Out of <em><strong>fear</strong></em> of clinging, they evade such questions.&nbsp;</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p>&ldquo;This is skillful,&rdquo; or that &ldquo;This is unskillful.&rdquo; I cannot declare any of that, as there are many pundits, masters of the debate who will cross-question, press me reasons, rebuke me, and I would not be able to stand my grounds. So out of fear, they evade.</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p>If you ask me if there exists another world [after death],&nbsp;&hellip; if the Tath\u0101gata exists after death&hellip; doesn&rsquo;t exist after death&hellip; both exists &amp; doesn&rsquo;t exist after death&hellip; neither exists nor doesn&rsquo;t exist after death,&nbsp;would I declare that to you?

And he discerns what is higher than that. And yet, discerning that, he does not grasp at it. And as he is not grasping at it, unbinding&nbsp;<em>[nibbuti]</em>&nbsp;is experienced right within. Knowing, as they have come to be, the origination, ending, allure, &amp; drawbacks of feelings, along with the escape from feelings, the Tath\u0101gata, monks&mdash;through lack of clinging/sustenance&mdash;is released.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>There, where any of those contemplatives &amp; brahmans who are theorists about the past, theorists about the future, &amp; theorists about the past &amp; the future hold views about the past &amp; the future, approve of various beliefs with reference to the past &amp; the future on 62 grounds, that is just an agitation &amp; vacillation to be felt by those contemplatives &amp; brahmans who, not knowing, not seeing, are immersed in craving.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>There, where any of those contemplatives &amp; brahmans who are theorists about the past, theorists about the future, &amp; theorists about the past &amp; the future hold views about the past &amp; the future, approve of various beliefs with reference to the past &amp; the future on 62 grounds, that comes from contact as a requisite condition.</p>\n\n<p>There, where any of those contemplatives &amp; brahmans who are theorists about the past, theorists about the future, &amp; theorists about the past &amp; the future hold views about the past &amp; the future, approve of various beliefs with reference to the past &amp; the future on 62 grounds: That they would experience that other than through contact isn&rsquo;t possible.</p>\n\n<p>where any of those contemplatives &amp; brahmans who are theorists about the past, theorists about the future, &amp; theorists about the past &amp; the future, who hold views about the past &amp; the future, who approve of various beliefs with reference to the past &amp; the future on 62 grounds:</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;They all experience that through repeated contact at the six sense media.

Such is the origination of this entire mass of stress &amp; suffering.</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;But when a monk discerns the origination, ending, allure, drawbacks of, &amp; emancipation from the six sense media, he discerns what is higher than all of this.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>How a monk guards the door of his senses?</p>\n\n<p>On seeing a form with the eye, he does not grasp at any theme or details by which&mdash;if he were to dwell without restraint over the faculty of the eye&mdash;evil, unskillful qualities such as greed or distress might assail him. Similarly with other senses..</p>\n\n<p>And how is a monk possessed of mindfulness &amp; alertness?</p>\n\n<p>By making himself alert at every moment: going, returning, looking toward, looking away, eating, drinking, chewing, tasting, bending, extending limbs, urinating, defecating, walking, standing, sitting, falling asleep, waking up, talking, remaining silent.</p>\n\n<p>Endowed with this noble aggregate of virtues, and restraint over senses, he seeks out a secluded dwelling:&nbsp;a wilderness, the shade of a tree, a mountain, a glen, a hillside cave, a charnel ground, a forest grove, the open air, a heap of straw. After his meal, returning from his alms round, he sits down, crosses his legs, holds his body erect, and brings mindfulness to the fore.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Abandoning covetousness with regard to the world, he dwells with an awareness devoid of covetousness. He cleanses his mind of covetousness.</p>\n\n<p>Abandoning ill will &amp; anger, he dwells with an awareness devoid of ill will, sympathetic with the welfare of all living beings. He cleanses his mind of ill will &amp; anger.</p>\n\n<p>Abandoning sloth &amp; drowsiness, he dwells with an awareness devoid of sloth &amp; drowsiness, mindful, alert, percipient of light. He cleanses his mind of sloth &amp; drowsiness.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Abandoning restlessness &amp; anxiety, he dwells undisturbed, his mind inwardly stilled. He cleanses his mind of restlessness &amp; anxiety.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Abandoning uncertainty, he dwells having crossed over uncertainty, with no perplexity with regard to skillful qualities. He cleanses his mind of uncertainty.</p>\n\n<p>A man who pas just paid his debt, a man who has recovered from sickness and now enjoys food and strength in body, a man released from bondage, slavery, now able to enjoy freedom, a man having passed a desolate country while travelling without any loss of property; just as these men&nbsp;experience joy and happiness, in the same way,&nbsp;when these five hindrances are abandoned in a monk, gladness is born. In one who is gladdened, rapture is born. Enraptured at heart, his body grows calm. His body calm, he is sensitive to pleasure. Feeling pleasure, his mind becomes concentrated.</p>\n\n<h2>The Four Jh\u0101nas</h2>\n\n<p>Quite secluded from sensuality, secluded from unskillful qualities, he enters and remains in the <span style=\"color:#8e44ad;\"><strong>first jh\u0101na:</strong> rapture &amp; pleasure born of seclusion, accompanied by directed thought and evaluation.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;He permeates and pervades, suffuses and fills this very body with the rapture &amp; pleasure born of seclusion.&nbsp;There is nothing of his entire body unpervaded by rapture &amp; pleasure born of seclusion.&nbsp;This is a fruit of the contemplative life, visible here &amp; now, more excellent than the previous ones and more sublime.</p>\n\n<p>Then, with the stilling of directed thoughts &amp; evaluations, he enters and remains in the <span style=\"color:#8e44ad;\"><strong>second jh\u0101na:</strong> rapture &amp; pleasure born of concentration, unification of awareness free from directed thought &amp; evaluation&mdash;internal assurance</span>. He permeates and pervades, suffuses and fills this very body with the rapture &amp; pleasure born of concentration.&nbsp;There is nothing of his entire body unpervaded by rapture &amp; pleasure born of concentration.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>And then, with the fading of rapture, he remains equanimous, mindful, &amp; alert, and senses pleasure with the body. He enters and remains in the <span style=\"color:#8e44ad;\"><strong>third jh\u0101na:</strong> &lsquo;Equanimous &amp; mindful, he has a pleasant abiding.</span>&rsquo; He permeates and pervades, suffuses and fills this very body with the pleasure divested of rapture.&nbsp;There is nothing of his entire body unpervaded with pleasure divested of rapture.</p>\n\n<p>And then, with the abandoning of pleasure &amp; pain&mdash;as with the earlier disappearance of elation &amp; distress&mdash;he enters and remains in the <span style=\"color:#8e44ad;\"><strong>fourth jh\u0101na:</strong> purity of equanimity &amp; mindfulness, neither pleasure nor pain</span>. He sits, permeating the body with a pure, bright awareness. Just as if a man were sitting covered from head to foot with a white cloth so that there would be no part of his body to which the white cloth did not extend; even so, the monk sits, permeating the body with a pure, bright awareness. There is nothing of his entire body unpervaded by pure, bright awareness.</p>\n\n<h2>Insight Knowledge</h2>\n\n<p>With his mind thus concentrated, purified, and bright, unblemished, free from defects, pliant, malleable, steady, and attained to imperturbability, he directs and inclines it to knowledge and vision. He discerns: &lsquo;This body of mine is endowed with form, composed of the four primary elements, born from mother and father, nourished with rice and porridge, subject to inconstancy, rubbing, pressing, dissolution, and dispersion. And this consciousness of mine is supported here and bound up here.</p>\n\n<h2>The Mind-made Body</h2>\n\n<p>With his mind thus concentrated, purified, and bright, unblemished, free from defects, pliant, malleable, steady, and attained to imperturbability, he directs and inclines it to creating a mind-made body. From this body he creates another body, endowed with form, made of the mind, complete in all its parts, not inferior in its faculties.</p>\n\n<h2>Supranormal Powers</h2>\n\n<p>With his mind thus concentrated, purified, and bright, unblemished, free from defects, pliant, malleable, steady, and attained to imperturbability, he directs and inclines it to the modes of supranormal powers. He wields manifold supranormal powers. Having been one he becomes many; having been many he becomes one. He appears. He vanishes. He goes unimpeded through walls, ramparts, and mountains as if through space. He dives in and out of the earth as if it were water. He walks on water without sinking as if it were dry land. Sitting cross-legged he flies through the air like a winged bird. With his hand he touches and strokes even the sun and moon, so mighty and powerful. He exercises influence with his body even as far as the Brahm\u0101 worlds.</p>\n\n<h2>Clairaudience</h2>\n\n<p>With his mind thus concentrated, purified, and bright, unblemished, free from defects, pliant, malleable, steady, and attained to imperturbability, he directs and inclines it to the divine ear-element. He hears&mdash;by means of the divine ear-element, purified and surpassing the human&mdash;both kinds of sounds: divine and human, whether near or far.</p>\n\n<h2>Mind Reading</h2>\n\n<p>With his mind thus concentrated, purified, and bright, unblemished, free from defects, pliant, malleable, steady, and attained to imperturbability, he directs and inclines it to knowledge of the awareness of other beings. He knows the awareness of other beings, other individuals, having encompassed it with his own awareness. He discerns a mind with passion as &lsquo;a mind with passion,&rsquo; and a mind without passion as &lsquo;a mind without passion.&rsquo; He discerns a mind with aversion as &lsquo;a mind with aversion,&rsquo; and a mind without aversion as &lsquo;a mind without aversion.&rsquo; He discerns a mind with delusion as &lsquo;a mind with delusion,&rsquo; and a mind without delusion as &lsquo;a mind without delusion.&rsquo; He discerns a restricted mind as &lsquo;a restricted mind,&rsquo; and a scattered mind as &lsquo;a scattered mind.&rsquo; He discerns an enlarged mind&nbsp;as &lsquo;an enlarged mind,&rsquo; and an unenlarged mind as &lsquo;an unenlarged mind.&rsquo; He discerns a surpassed mind [one that is not at the most excellent level] as &lsquo;a surpassed mind,&rsquo; and an unsurpassed mind as &lsquo;an unsurpassed mind.&rsquo; He discerns a concentrated mind as &lsquo;a concentrated mind,&rsquo; and an unconcentrated mind as &lsquo;an unconcentrated mind.&rsquo; He discerns a released mind&nbsp;as &lsquo;a released mind,&rsquo; and an unreleased mind as &lsquo;an unreleased mind.&rsquo;</p>\n\n<h2>Recollection of Past Lives</h2>\n\n<p>With his mind thus concentrated, purified, and bright, unblemished, free from defects, pliant, malleable, steady, and attained to imperturbability, he directs and inclines it to knowledge of the recollection of past lives [lit: previous homes]. He recollects his manifold past lives, i.e., one birth, two births, three births, four, five, ten, twenty, thirty, forty, fifty, one hundred, one thousand, one hundred thousand, many eons of cosmic contraction, many eons of cosmic expansion, many eons of cosmic contraction &amp; expansion, (recollecting,) &lsquo;There I had such a name, belonged to such a clan, had such an appearance. Such was my food, such my experience of pleasure &amp; pain, such the end of my life. Passing away from that state, I re-arose there. There too I had such a name, belonged to such a clan, had such an appearance. Such was my food, such my experience of pleasure &amp; pain, such the end of my life. Passing away from that state, I re-arose here.&rsquo;&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h2>The Passing Away&nbsp;<em>&amp;</em>&nbsp;Re-appearance of Beings</h2>\n\n<p>With his mind thus concentrated, purified, and bright, unblemished, free from defects, pliant, malleable, steady, and attained to imperturbability, he directs and inclines it to knowledge of the passing away and re-appearance of beings. He sees&mdash;by means of the divine eye, purified and surpassing the human&mdash;beings passing away and re-appearing, and he discerns how they are inferior and superior, beautiful and ugly, fortunate and unfortunate in accordance with their kamma: &lsquo;These beings&mdash;who were endowed with bad conduct of body, speech, and mind, who reviled the noble ones, held wrong views and undertook actions under the influence of wrong views&mdash;with the break-up of the body, after death, have re-appeared in a plane of deprivation, a bad destination, a lower realm, hell. But these beings&mdash;who were endowed with good conduct of body, speech, and mind, who did not revile the noble ones, who held right views and undertook actions under the influence of right views&mdash;with the break-up of the body, after death, have re-appeared in a good destination, a heavenly world.&rsquo; Thus&mdash;by means of the divine eye, purified and surpassing the human&mdash;he sees beings passing away and re-appearing, and he discerns how they are inferior and superior, beautiful and ugly, fortunate and unfortunate in accordance with their kamma.</p>\n\n<h2>The Ending of Effluents</h2>\n\n<p>With his mind thus concentrated, purified, and bright, unblemished, free from defects, pliant, malleable, steady, and attained to imperturbability, the monk directs and inclines it to the knowledge of the ending of effluents.<a href=\"https://www.dhammatalks.org/suttas/DN/DN02.html#dn2note04\">4</a>&nbsp;He discerns, as it has come to be, that &lsquo;This is stress&hellip; This is the origination of stress&hellip; This is the cessation of stress&hellip; This is the way leading to the cessation of stress&hellip; These are effluents&hellip; This is the origination of effluents&hellip; This is the cessation of effluents&hellip; This is the way leading to the cessation of effluents.&rsquo; His heart, thus knowing, thus seeing, is released from the effluent of sensuality, the effluent of becoming, the effluent of ignorance. With release, there is the knowledge, &lsquo;Released.&rsquo; He discerns that &lsquo;Birth is ended, the holy life fulfilled, the task done. There is nothing further for this world.</p>\n\n<h2>On Perception</h2>\n\n<p>Po\u1e6d\u1e6dhap\u0101da: &quot;How is there the ultimate cessation of perception?&quot; Some say:</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>A person&rsquo;s perception arises and ceases without cause, without reason.</li>\n\t<li>Perception is a person&rsquo;s self, which comes and goes.</li>\n\t<li>No, that&rsquo;s not how it is, for there are contemplatives &amp; brahmans of great power, great potency. They draw perception in and out of a person.</li>\n\t<li>No, that&rsquo;s not how it is, for there are devas of great power, great potency. They draw perception in and out of a person.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Buddha:</p>\n\n<p>those contemplatives &amp; brahmans who say that a person&rsquo;s perception arises &amp; ceases without cause, without reason, are wrong from the very start. Why is that? Because a person&rsquo;s perception arises &amp; ceases with a cause, with a reason. With training, one perception arises and with training another perception ceases. And what is that training?&nbsp;<br />\n.... Seeing that these five hindrances have been abandoned within him, he becomes glad. Glad, he becomes enraptured. Enraptured, his body grows tranquil. His body tranquil, he is sensitive to pleasure. Feeling pleasure, his mind becomes concentrated.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&lt;&lt;... The Four Jh\u0101nas .....&gt;&gt;</p>\n\n<p>And further, with the complete transcending of perceptions of (physical) form, with the disappearance of perceptions of resistance, and not heeding perceptions of multiplicity, (perceiving,) &lsquo;Infinite space,&rsquo; the monk <strong><span style=\"color:#8e44ad;\">enters &amp; remains in the dimension of the infinitude of space</span></strong>. His earlier perception of a refined truth of neither pleasure nor pain ceases, and on that occasion there is a perception of a refined truth of the dimension of the infinitude of space.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>And further, with the complete transcending of the dimension of the infinitude of space, (perceiving,) &lsquo;Infinite consciousness,&rsquo; the monk <strong><span style=\"color:#8e44ad;\">enters &amp; remains in the dimension of the infinitude of consciousness</span></strong>. His earlier perception of a refined truth of the dimension of the infinitude of space ceases, and on that occasion there is a perception of a refined truth of the dimension of the infinitude of consciousness.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>And further, with the complete transcending of the dimension of the infinitude of consciousness, (perceiving,) &lsquo;There is nothing,&rsquo; <strong><span style=\"color:#8e44ad;\">enters &amp; remains in the dimension of nothingness</span></strong>. His earlier perception of a refined truth of the dimension of the infinitude of consciousness ceases, and on that occasion there is a perception of a refined truth of the dimension of nothingness. &nbsp;And thus it is that with training one perception arises and with training another perception ceases.</p>\n\n<p>Now, when the monk is percipient of himself here, then from there to there, step by step, he touches the peak of perception. As he remains at the peak of perception, the thought occurs to him, &lsquo;Thinking is bad for me. Not thinking is better for me. If I were to think and will, this perception of mine would cease, and a grosser perception would appear. What if I were neither to think nor to will?&rsquo; <span style=\"color:#8e44ad;\">So he neither thinks nor wills, and as he is neither thinking nor willing</span>, that perception ceases&nbsp;and another, grosser perception does not appear. He touches cessation. This, Po\u1e6d\u1e6dhap\u0101da, is how there is the alert&nbsp;step-by step attainment of the ultimate cessation of perception.</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;But, lord, does the Blessed One describe one peak of perception or many peaks of perception?&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;In whatever way one touches cessation, Po\u1e6d\u1e6dhap\u0101da, that&rsquo;s the way I describe the peak of perception.&nbsp;That&rsquo;s how I describe one peak of perception and many peaks of perception.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;Now, lord, does perception arise first, and knowledge after; or does knowledge arise first, and perception after; or do perception &amp; knowledge arise simultaneously?&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;Po\u1e6d\u1e6dhap\u0101da, perception arises first, and knowledge after. And the arising of knowledge comes from the arising of perception. One discerns, &lsquo;It&rsquo;s in dependence on this&nbsp;that my knowledge has arisen.&rsquo; Through this line of reasoning one can realize how perception arises first, and knowledge after, and how the arising of knowledge comes from the arising of perception.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;Now, lord, is perception a person&rsquo;s self, or is perception one thing and self another?&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;Now, lord, is perception a person&rsquo;s self, or is perception one thing and self another?&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;What self do you posit, Po\u1e6d\u1e6dhap\u0101da?&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;I posit a gross self, possessed of form, made up of the four great elements [earth, water, fire, and wind], feeding on physical food.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;....even as there remains this gross self&mdash;possessed of form, made up of the four great elements, and feeding on food&mdash;one perception arises for that person as another perception passes away. It&rsquo;s through this line of reasoning that one can realize how perception will be one thing and self another.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;Then, lord, I posit a mind-made self complete in all its parts, not inferior in its faculties.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;....even as there remains this mind-made self&mdash;complete in all its parts, not inferior in its faculties&mdash;one perception arises for that person as another perception passes away. It&rsquo;s through this line of reasoning that one can realize how perception will be one thing and self another.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;Then, lord, I posit a formless self made of perception.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;even as there remains this formless self made of perception, one perception arises for that person as another perception passes away. It&rsquo;s through this line of reasoning that one can realize how perception will be one thing and self another.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>(The statement that) &lsquo;The cosmos is eternal&rsquo; I have taught and declared to be a not categorical teaching. (The statement that) &lsquo;The cosmos is not eternal&rsquo; &hellip; &lsquo;The cosmos is finite&rsquo; &hellip; &lsquo;The cosmos is infinite&rsquo; &hellip; &lsquo;The soul &amp; the body are the same&rsquo; &hellip; &lsquo;The soul is one thing and the body another&rsquo; &hellip; &lsquo;After death a Tath\u0101gata exists&rsquo; &hellip; &lsquo;After death a Tath\u0101gata does not exist&rsquo; &hellip; &lsquo;After death a Tath\u0101gata both exists &amp; does not exist&rsquo; &hellip; &lsquo;After death a Tath\u0101gata neither exists nor does not exist&rsquo; I have taught and declared to be a not categorical teaching. And why have I taught and declared these teachings to be not categorical? Because they are not conducive to the goal, are not conducive to the Dhamma, are not basic to the holy life.
