{"name": "Meditation", "id": 61, "content": "<h2>THE HEART OF MEDITATION: DALAI LAMA</h2>\n\n<p>Concentration Meditation: The pupose is to develop calm, peaceful, stable mind. The two factors that prevent its development are Laxity and Ecitement. The antidote to these are: Mindfulness and Introspection.</p>\n\n<p>The object of observation for meditation can be external object or the mind itself. When mind itself is the object, then practice is more profound.</p>\n\n<p>Posture: Sit in either full or half-cross legged. Use a cushion such that your rear is higher so that you don&#39;t get tired. Backbone straight like an arrow; neck to be bent just a little downward, aim your eyes over the nose to the front; touch your tongue to the roof of the mouth; leave your lips and teeth as usual; leave your arms a little loose, not forcing them against the body. Put the hands in the position of meditative equipose - the left hand below the right and the two thumbs touching, making a triangle the base of which is above four finger-widths below the navel.</p>\n\n<p>Meditate on inhalation and exhalation of the breath up to a count of 21.</p>\n\n<p>Be mindful about when the mind thinks of past or future events, don&#39;t let that happen; leave the mind vivid just as it is, any object, any sound, any conception, any idea that appears in the mind just experience, don&#39;t name them, don&#39;t assign them to any source.</p>\n\n<p>Timing: In the morning when your mind has awakened and it is cear, but your senses are not yet fully operating e.g. around 3:30. It helps not to have eaten too much on the night before, or to have slept too much.</p>\n\n<p>You can even practice this in bed.</p>\n\n<h2>The Puspose of Concentration</h2>\n\n<p>After the mind is clear, calm and stable, meditate on selflessness, emptiness. Emptiness doesn&#39;t mean that phenomena are non-existent and unable to perform functions.</p>\n\n<p>We get angry, make enemies because we consider the appearances as inherently established. There is no &quot;I&quot; and &quot;enemy&quot; solid and independent. Then there is discrimination of enemy and victim.</p>\n\n<p>EMPTYNESS: Things are not empty because they don&#39;t have existence or are unable to perform any function or that they do not constitute some substance. Rather things are empty because of being dependent; <strong><em>dependent-arising</em></strong>.</p>\n\n<p>Self is not independent, the self that we see normally seems to have independent nature, but if we see the dependent-arising, it means that there is no such self hence <em><strong>selflessness</strong></em>.</p>\n\n<p>The purpose of concentration is to develop a mind which is able to meditate on emptiness.</p>\n\n<h2>Innermost Awareness (The Ultimate Truth)</h2>\n\n<p>Something that pervades all forms of consciousness. How can we see it? By attaining nonthought, nonconceptualization.</p>\n\n<p>Dodrubchen said that although we might fancy that we are meditating on innermost awareness there is a danger that we are acually, in fact, merely maintaining concentration on the clear and cognitive nature of a more superficial mind and so we need to take care, It is helpful to do later but it is not so profound.</p>\n\n<p>Ten vehicles:</p>\n\n<p>Great Completeness is the highest.</p>\n\n<p>Patrul Rinpoche&#39;s Poem &amp; Teaching:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>First set your mind in relaxed state, not emitting, not withdrawing, without conceptuality.</p>\n\n<p>In this relaxed state of total absorption,</p>\n\n<p>Suddenly shout PAT, striking your awareness, Strong, intense, short. E MA HO!</p>\n\n<p>Not any thing, astounding. Astounding, unimpeded penetration.</p>\n\n<p>Unimpleded penetration, inexpressible.</p>\n\n<p>Identify innermost awareness of the truth body.</p>\n\n<p>Its entity is identified within yourself &mdash; the first essential.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The above was introduction to innermost awareness. Now you need to engage in continuous mode of meditation:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Then, whether spreading out or abiding within,</p>\n\n<p>Whether angry or desirous, happy or sad,</p>\n\n<p>At all times and occasions,</p>\n\n<p>Recognize the identified pristine wisdom truth body,</p>\n\n<p>For those with prior acquaintance, the mother and child clear lights meet.</p>\n\n<p>Be founded in the the inexpressible state of the quality of innermost awareness.</p>\n\n<p>Stability, bliss, luminosity, and delight should again and again be destroyed.</p>\n\n<p>Make the syllable of method and wisdom suddenly descend.</p>\n\n<p>Meditative equipose and subsequent attainment do not differ.</p>\n\n<p>Continuously dwelling in the undifferentiable state,</p>\n\n<p>Session and between-session are not divided.</p>\n\n<p>However until attaining stability,</p>\n\n<p>Meditation within having abandoned commotion is to be valued.</p>\n\n<p>Practice is done within division into sessions.</p>\n\n<p>At all times and occasions,</p>\n\n<p>Maintain the display of just the truth body.</p>\n\n<p>Be firmly decided that there is none other than this.</p>\n\n<p>Be determined on this alone - the second essential.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>At this time, within knowing the basic entity</p>\n\n<p>Of all desires and hatreds, pleasures and pains,</p>\n\n<p>And all adventitious conceptions, no subsequent connection is made.</p>\n\n<p>Through identifying the truth body, the mode of release.</p>\n\n<p>They become like writing on water.</p>\n\n<p>With uninterrupted self-appearance and self-release,</p>\n\n<p>Whatever dawns is sustenance for naked empty awareness.</p>\n\n<p>Whatever fluctuates is the royal sport of the truth body.</p>\n\n<p>Self-purifying without a trace, A LA LA.</p>\n\n<p>The way they dawn is like earlier,</p>\n\n<p>But the modes of release are importantly different.</p>\n\n<p>Meditation without this is a mistaken path.</p>\n\n<p>Those having this, without meditation, are within the truth body.</p>\n\n<p>Confidence is found upon release &mdash; the third essential</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<hr />\n<h2>MEDITATION AND ITS PRACTICE - SWAMI RAMA</h2>\n\n<p>Before Meditation:</p>\n\n<p><strong>Cleansing:</strong></p>\n\n<p>Have a bath maybe, or just clean your face, hands etc. It is necessary to feel fresh.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Stretching:</strong></p>\n\n<p>Do yoga <em>asanas</em>&nbsp;which are not very strenuous, rather energizing. E.g. Hatha Yoga</p>\n\n<p><strong>Relaxing:</strong></p>\n\n<p>Do Shavasana, and focus to different muscles gradually, and go up and down the body in your introspection.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Breathing:</strong></p>\n\n<p>Use breathing exercises to calm yourself down.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>During Meditation:</p>\n\n<p><strong>Posture:</strong></p>\n\n<p>Lotus position is not mandatory. The only thing mandatory is to keep your head, neck and back straight, so that you can breath easily with your diaphragm. Arms and shoulders should be relaxed, gently put on knees.</p>\n\n<p>Finger Lock: Touching your thumb with index finger forming a circle.</p>\n\n<p>There are different asanas/postures: Maitriasana, Sukhasana, Swastikasana, Siddhasana, Lotus Position etc</p>\n\n<p><strong>One&nbsp;Pointed Focus/ Concentration:&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n<p>On anything: a symbol, a word, an image, a point, a phrase, a sound. They should be holy though. Not every word can be mantra.</p>\n\n<p>Alertness: your mind <strong>will</strong>&nbsp;wander off, just try to bring it back as soon as possible. Remain alert about&nbsp;this, while remaining relaxed at the same time. Treat your mind as a naughty child.</p>\n\n<p>You don&#39;t need to speak mantras, hear them from within. Best is A-U-M.</p>\n\n<p>Mantras should be imparted by a qualified teacher only.</p>\n\n<p>Thoughts will continue to arise, but most will dissipate if you witness in a neutral way, without creating an internal conflict.</p>\n\n<p>Physical sensations are not a sign of deeper experiences, in fact they represent that there&#39;s some tension in the body.</p>\n\n<p>The meditator is an interior researcher whose findings help bring out levels of creative intelligence which can be useful in the external world.</p>\n\n<p>Don&#39;t give up out of impatience or laziness. You&#39;ll make steady progress if you continue your practice sincerley.</p>\n\n<p>Our breathing reflects our mental state. E.g. your mind feels anxious, your breathing becomes rapid and slow. Breathing process can have powerful impact on meditation. These are four irregularities in breathing: shallowness of breath, jerks in the breath, noisy breathing, and extended pauses between inhalation and exhalation. They need to be eliminated and bring breathing to regular. Observe that these irregularities correspond to some mental activity, distractions.</p>\n\n<p>Sitting still is important &mdash; the less movement, the more steady mind will be.</p>\n\n<p>When the breath begins to flow freely and smoothly through oth nostrils, the mind attains a state of joy and calmness. This joyful state is a requirement for going into deeper states, because it helps the mind become quiet and steady.</p>\n\n<p>Observe the flow of breath, quality of smoothness, from where in the body the breath seems to arise, and the rhythm of the breath.</p>\n\n<p>When you establish diaphragmatic breathing, you allow the lungs to expand fully with the inhalation and to be emptied more completely on the exhalation. When you breathe evenly and diaphragmatically, breathing becomes more efficient; you will breathe more slowly because each breath carries more air and life-force. However, it is impossible to do so unless the head, neck and the trunk of the body are correctly aligned.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>While there are breathing exercises that intentionally alter the length of the exhalations or the inhalations, when you do this unconsciously, and it is damaging to the body.</p>\n\n<p>To reestablish the even pattern of breathing, exhale as if you were breathing down to your toes, and inhale upto the crown of your head. It is important to keep the entire process even and smooth in flow, without any jerkiness or irregularity. At the conclusion of the smooth exhalation, you begin another inhalation, and continue on in this manner.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Unconsciously holding the breath between inhalation and exhalation is a bad practice, it creates imbalance in the nervous system.</p>\n\n<p>The entire breathing process should be smooth and natural, without any breathlessness, gasping or feeling of being forced.</p>\n\n<p>Practice and perfect the diapragmatic breathing process: Lie down in Shavasana, place one hand on the chest and the other on the abdomen at about the navel area, it will be easxy to tell whether you are breathing diaphragmatically because you will feel a gentle movement at the navel as the abdomen rises with the inhalation and falls with the exhalation. If you are breathing diaphragmatically you will not feel much movement in the chest.</p>\n\n<p>Two-to-One Breathing exercise: Exhale for twice the length of duration of inhalation. 5-10 minutes. This will energize your body and mind.</p>\n\n<p>Predominant flow of breath shifts back and forth between the left and the right nostrils.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nadi_(yoga)\" target=\"_blank\">Nadi</a> Shodhanam: Done after asanas and relaxing phase. Should be done twice a day, morning and evening with empty stomach. Inhale through one nostril and exhale through the other. Start with exhalation through&nbsp;left nostril (in morning or midday) or right nostril (in the evening). At any time, only one nostril is active, to find out which one, place your finger below opening of the nostril, and feel the air. Or use a mirror to see the where the air forms condensation on the mirror. Naturally, the active and passive nostrils alternate every 90 or so minutes. You should be able to control it consciously.</p>\n\n<p><img alt=\"\" height=\"600/\" src=\"/images/nadi_shodhanam.png\" width=\"90%\" /></p>\n\n<p>A special hand position is used to gently close the nostrils in alternation. Bring the right hand up to the nose, and fold the index and middle fingers to the palm, so that you can use the thumb to close the right nostril, and the ring finger to close the left nostril. Be sure that your head, neck and trunk of the body are still aligned straight. Not too much pressure in closing the nostrils. The inhalation and exhalation process should be even, smooth, without force, without jerk.</p>\n\n<p>After this is achieved, at the intermediate level, student should practice three rounds of nadi shodhanam, taking three, or more if required, breaths through both nostrils at the end of each round to rest and recover the natural internal rhythm of breathing. &nbsp;When practicing three rounds in one sitting, the second round begins with the opposite nostril and hence the pattern is reversed from the first and third round.</p>\n\n<p>When you progress in this and you will see that during meditation you are able to breathe through both of the nostrils.</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"font-size:16px;\"><strong>The Prorgam For Meditation:</strong></span></p>\n\n<p>The above is preparation for meditation. Develop a habit of sitting for meditation at the same time daily. Fix a posture and get confortable with it. The cushion that you use for meditation sitting should not be too hard, too high, spongy, or unstable.</p>\n\n<p>When you start, your body may shake, perspire or become numb. You should learn to ignore all this. Subtler muscles such as cheeks or eyes, may twitch.</p>\n\n<p>Start with a short duration like 10-15&nbsp;minutes. Increase it gradually e.g. by 3&nbsp;mins on every third day. Massage your toes, legs and thighs when you get up from meditation seat.</p>\n\n<p>Survey your whole body from the crown of your head to toe. Observe if there&#39;s any tension (physical sensations represent tension). Do not try to fix them, just observe quietly. Do the reverse, from toe to head.</p>\n\n<p>Understanding the mind:</p>\n\n<p>The whole process of meditation aims towards understanding the mind, and become the master of it rather than being slave to it. Anything within domain of mind can be healed by the mind, once we know our&nbsp;deeper nature.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n", "authorId": 1, "subject": "philosophy", "tags": [], "img": "", "summary": "", "lastUpdated": "2021-09-12 15:25:56.035527"}
