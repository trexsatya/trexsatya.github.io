{"name":"Cognitive Dissonance","id":72,"content":"<div class=\"box1\">\n<ul>\n\t<li>You are an addict to smoking. You hear someone say &quot;Smoking kills&quot;. You say, &quot;That&#39;s bullshit. We don&#39;t have enough proof that smoking kills&quot;. Or, &quot;We are&nbsp;gonna die someday anyway, at least it gives me some pleasure&quot;. Or, &quot;Smoking reduces stress&quot;. Or, &quot;Smoking makes it easier for me to socialize&quot;.</li>\n\t<li>You buy a car, a nice car, but you find that it&#39;s not good for long drives, but only for short drives, it is comfortable. You say, &quot;Oh well! At least it&#39;s a nice car, comfortable&quot;. Or, you sell your car.</li>\n\t<li>You try a lot to woo some girl, and you fail, finally, you say, &quot;She is not worth it anyway&quot; - Grapes are sour.</li>\n\t<li>You like someone, but you find that he/she hates your brother. You say, &quot;This is not possible!&quot;. Or, &quot;That&#39;s because he/she doesn&#39;t know my brother well&quot;.&nbsp;</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n\n<p><br />\nWhat&#39;s happening in all these situations? There is a lack of harmony between things as they are and things that are in your mind. In technical terms, there is &quot;cognitive dissonance&quot;. We can categorize these sort of dissonances:</p>\n\n<p>(i) Belief Disconfirmation (When you believe something, and proofs/events say something else)</p>\n\n<p>(ii) Induced Compliance&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>(iii) Free Choice (when your choice conflicts with people&#39;s choice, maybe your friends&#39;)</p>\n\n<p>(iv) Effort Justification (when your effort goes in vain, and you try to justify your effort)</p>\n\n<p>The stories that our brain forms, the consolations that it forms. ..&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>How to spot Dissonance?</strong></p>\n\n<p>When a person&nbsp;takes a decision/action that goes against normal reasoning. E.g. you were paid less for a boring task, still, you say that the task was interesting. While if someone is paid fair, he would see the boring action as it is.</p>\n\n<p>One more example, suppose my life is boring, and yet, I say that I have a good life.</p>\n\n<p>When you justify your thoughts/behavior <u>incorrectly</u>&nbsp;or seek to justify it <u>incorrectly</u>&nbsp;(by gathering information which only support your beliefs, and present to counter-arguments).</p>\n\n<p><strong>How much stress (dissonance) is caused?</strong></p>\n\n<p>Depends on the strength of cognitions and the difference between them. And obviously, how you handle things (your personality, your habits, your mood/disposition etc).</p>\n\n<p><strong>What&#39;s the point of knowing this?</strong></p>\n\n<ol>\n\t<li>Self Awareness</li>\n\t<li>People can use this to their advantage <em>(People take advantage of every knowledge/idea/theory, nothing new!!)</em>. For example, smoking promoter companies can present you with some weak (false) evidence against evils of smoking, and you will most likely not quit smoking.</li>\n\t<li>Does someone tease you by calling names? Give them a coin or a smile whenever they do so. It will cause dissonance between their belief that you should get angry and the fact that you don&#39;t. They will most likely change their behavior.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p><strong>How does a person resolve Dissonance?</strong></p>\n\n<p>That depends on a lot of factors. Obviously, the personality of the person, the situation, mind-frame etc. all play a role. A person will most likely choose the easiest option: either get rid of cognition, ignore the&nbsp;conflicting view/proof, create a new cognition (middle ground maybe), justify the cognition.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_dissonance\">See Wikipedia for detail</a>.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n","authorId":null,"subject":"psychology","tags":null,"img":"/images/psychology.jpg","summary":"Often times, you may find your mind puzzled/ stressed when what you already know/ believeÂ and  some event/knowledge do not come along.
