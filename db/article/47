Starting now you are a hard heartless career gal, go to work, be awesome at it, don&#39;t waste time on foolish flights of fancy. From now on, you are a robot. Beep bop boop... - <em>Princess Caroline</em></p>\n\n<hr />\n<p>When was the last time you were actually happy? - Diane to Bojack</p>\n\n<hr />\n<p>I didn&#39;t do anything wrong, because I can&#39;t do anything wrong. Because we are all just products of our environments, bouncing around like marbles in the game of Hungry Hungry Hippos, that is our random and cruel universe. - Bojack</p>\n\n<hr />\n<p>I was hurt, but then I realized it&#39;s just the way you are. You know maybe I just need to stop expecting you to be a good person so that way I won&#39;t get hurt when you are not. - Todd</p>\n\n<hr />\n<p>(Do you think I&#39;m a good person deep down?)
