Babies&#39;s heads were getting bigger and bigger. Women who gave birth when infants head were relatively small and supple ,had more chance of survival. By natural selection giving birth in this infant state (premature birth compare to other animals) became norm for homos. (This inference is partly supported by the fact that most animals become independent of their mother in few weeks). But for homos it takes much more time for the baby to become independent. This resulted in requirement of high social skills. Homos became more apt in forming tribes. Because it takes a tribe to develop a homo child. Also because of this&nbsp;premature birth homos infants are more like a blank canvas and its easy to mould them, that&#39;s why so much development has been made.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Domestification Of Fire</strong> (around 300k years ago): Controlled fire helped in getting better, easier to digest food. It was like limitless power in homos&#39; hands.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Interbreeding Theory</strong> and the opposite <strong>Replacement Theory</strong>: (during around 70k-10k yrs ago): According to the first one, current Homo Sapiens population is result of interbreeding of original Sapiens and other Homo species, because original Sapiens travelled to different lands and bred with the inhabitants there (Some studies have found the DNA similarity of upto 4% among Sapiens and others). Replacement theory suggests that interbreeding was not possible because of genetic, physical&nbsp; differences and other species in Homo genus died off to leave pure Sapiens. It is not impossible that Sapiens themselves extincted other Homos.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Cognitive Revolution</strong>&nbsp;and Basic Inventions (during around 70k-30k yrs ago): like boats, oil lamps,&nbsp; bows, arrows, needles. Religion, commerce and social stratification are also evident.<br />\n&nbsp; &nbsp;What caused this intelligence? Not sure, maybe random genetic mutation.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Origin of Imagination</strong> (&nbsp;around 30k yrs ago): Lionman/Lioness-woman figure (body of human, head of lion) have been found in caves. We know that such a creature could not exist (based on our knowledge), then someone must have imagined this. What triggered these kind of&nbsp;imaginations. Not sure, maybe it was random.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Invention of Languages</strong> (&nbsp;around 30k yrs ago): It was for survival. Spreading information about other humans (Gossip theory). Benefits were: larger social groups, more co-operation.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Question: Can you make a monkey give you a banana by promising him a limitless banana after death in heaven? Not sure, Maybe if we were apt in their language.</p>\n\n<p>The Alpha male wins the Alpha position not because of his stronger physique, but because he leads a larger, stable coalition (has more supporters from the members within group). The members of coalition spend more time together, share, and help each other. When the size of coalition increases beyond a threshold, it leads to rupture and separation to form a newer coalition (because coalition requires intimacy, which becomes difficult in larger groups). Chimpanzees tend to limit at 100 members. Humans have smaller limit (in terms of intimacy). But humans found ways to form bands of different sizes based on&nbsp;different aspects. Bonding in humans based on&nbsp;Gossip theory is limited by 150.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Commerccial Imagination and Inventions</strong>:&nbsp; Corporations (legal bodies) do not have physical existence. There are CEOs, workers, shareholders but company remains there if everyone vanishes. These are limited liabilities companies.</p>\n\n<p>The existence of Corporates, Money, Trade is quite similar to existence of Gods, Nations. They came into existence and are affirmed by stories who could convince a large number of&nbsp;people. These are not reality and these are not lie. These are imagined-reality and exert force into world. They were meant to bring strangers together.</p>\n\n<p>After the period of Cognitive Revolution, humans explaination can be studied&nbsp;independent of Biology.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Agricultural Revolution</strong> is the most controversial events in history of the humankind. Some partisans proclaim that it set humankind on the road to prosperity and progress. Others insist that it led to perdition. This was the turning point, they say, where Sapiens cast off its intimate symbiosis with nature and sprinted towards greed and alienation.&nbsp;<br />\nThe extra they produced fed the tiny minority of the elites - kings, government officials, soldiers, priests, artists, and thinkers - who filll the history books.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>Imagined Order</strong>: The root problem of wars and revolutions was not shortage of food or something..humans evolved for millions of years in small bands of a few dozen individuals. The handful of millenia seperating the Agricultural Revolution from the appearance of the cities, kingdoms, and empires was not enough time to allow an instinct for mass cooperation to evolve.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; All these cooperation networks from cities of ancient Mesopotamia to Qin and Roman empires - were &#39;imagined orders&#39;, based on belief in shared myths. Code Of Hammurabis is a good source that tells about the social order of ancient times (of Babylon, one of the oldest cities). Hammurabi&#39;s Code and American Delaration Of Independence (35,00 years later), both managed to bind a mass of people. They both claim to outline eternal and universal principles of justice, but they both disagree on many things (like&nbsp;American Delaration Of Independence&nbsp; dictates that <q><cite>All men are created equal, endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable rights inlcuding life, liberty and pursuit of happiness</cite></q>, and&nbsp; Hammurabi&#39;s Code clearly indicates that people decidedly unequal. They both are wrong, as they imagined a reality governed by universal and immutable principles which exists only in their fertile imagination and myths created around those.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;We believe in an order not because its objectively true, but because believing in it enables us to cooperate effectively and forge a better society.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>True Believers</strong>: Voltaire said <cite><q>There is no God, but don&#39;t tell that to my servant, lest he murder me at night</q>.</cite>&nbsp;In order to safeguard an imagined order, continuous and strenuous efforts are imperative. Some of these efforts take the shape of violence and coercion. A&nbsp; single priest (a true believer) often does the work of a hundred soldiers, far more cheaply and effectively.&nbsp;You cannot form a military by coercion.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>The Prison Walls</strong>: How do you make people believe in <em>imagined orders</em>&nbsp;such as Christianity, Democracy, Nationalism or Capitalism, for so long?&nbsp;First, do not accept that it&#39;s imagined order. Educate and constantly remind about this order. Carve the imagined order into materialistic world. e.g. A private room in a nice house for your kid affirms the imagined order of <em>individualism</em>. A kid in medieval baron had to sleep along with other youths affirmed that he had to maintain a status among his peers.&nbsp;<br />\n&nbsp; &nbsp; Every person is born into a pre-existing imaginary order, and his views, desires are shaped by this and its dominant myths. e.g. Friends giving examples to each other &#39;Follow your heart&#39;. But heart is a double agent, that usually take its instructions from the dominant myths of the day, and the very recommendation to follow our heart was implanted in our minds by a combination of 19th century romantic myths and 20th century consumerist myths. Spending a great deal of money on holidays abroad could be a result of myths of romantic consumerism rather than instinctive desire.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;Romanticism (e.g. &#39;how a new experience opened my eyes and changed my life&#39; ). Consumerism (e.g. tells us that in order to be happy we must consume as many products and services as we can).&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;In order to break free from an imagined order, you have to create shared understanding among the mass, and that can be done only by some other imagined order. There is no way out of the imagined order. When we break down our prison walls, and run towards freedom, we are in fact running into the more spacious exercise yard of a bigger prison.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>The Wonders Of Beaurocracy</strong>: The rise of scripts after simple mathematical symbols, gave birth to poetry, drama, history etc. Mahabharata, Hebrew Bible, Buddhist Tipitika, Greek Iliad remained oral for long times.<br />\n&nbsp; Script has changed the way humans think and view the world e.g. Clerks and Accountants are most likely to think not-human like filing cabinets.</p>\n\n<p>The Language Of Numbers: Writing was born as maidservant of human consciousness, but is increasingly becoming its master. We are teaching homo sapiens to talk, feel and dream in the language of numbers which computers can understand.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong><u>There is no Justice in History</u></strong>:</p>\n\n<p>Imagined orders and devised scripts made large networks possible, but these imagined orders were neither neutral nor fair. This divided people into make-believe groups, arranged in hierarchy. The upper levels enjoyed power and privileges, while lower ones suffered from discrimination and oppresssion. Hammurabi&#39;s Code divided into Superiors, Commoners, and Slaves. The American order divided into hierarchies too. Blacks and Whites, Men and Women, did not enjoy equal rights, liberty and freedom. Most of the signers on American order of independence were slave-holders and they did not release slaves.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;Myths have argued for ages that the hierarchy is natural e.g. Whites believing that they are innately more intelligent, diligent and deserving than Blacks. Hindus believing that one caste is above other, Pandits emerged from Purusa&#39;s (the primeval being) mouth, Kshatriya from its arms, and Shudras from its legs. Ancient Chinese believing that goddess Nu Wa created humans from earth, she kneaded aristocrats from fine yellow soil, whereas commoners from brown mud.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;But we know that these hierarchies are merge fragments of human imaginations.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Modern Westerners are shocked by laws forbiding Blacks living in neighborhood of the Whites, or to study in white schools. But the hierarchy of rich and poor, which mandates that rich live in rich, separate and more luxurious neighborhoods, study in separate and more prestigious schools, receive treatment in better hospitals,&nbsp;than poor&nbsp;- seems perfectly sensible to most Europeans and Americans.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>The Vicious Circle</strong>: Why did Indian society classify people according to caste, Ottoman society according to religion, and American society according to race? In most cases the hierarchy originated as the result of a set of accidental historical circumstances and was then perpetual and refined over many generations as different groups developed vested interests in it. The members of the caste always find something to futher discriminate. e.g. Hindu castes are further divided by <em>Jaati</em>s.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;Even after making laws against original discriminations, the effect of the tools/ideas used to spread and justify the discrimination is still persistent. e.g in 19th century imperial Britain outlawed slavery, and stopped Atlantic slave trading, in the decade following that slavery was outlawed in American continent. But the tools/ideas, association with religions, myths (e.g. that Africans descend from Han, son of Noah, saddled by his father with a curse that his offspring would be slaves, that touching, eating with, marrying lower castes will pollute not only the individual but the society as whole) [<em>is this truth?</em>&nbsp;if you statistically try to find out the truth, it may as well look like the truth, but that&#39;s not because of natural ordering, but because of correlation between cause and effects&nbsp;]</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;Unjust discrimination often gets worse, not better, with time.&nbsp; Money comes to money, education comes to education, and ignorance to ignorance.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Nothing is unnatural, if we believe in evolution. Evolution definitely developes some organs for some specific tasks, but it does not forbid it to do anything else. So, homosexuality is not unnatural.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>Men vs Women</strong>: Male are not men until they acquire some traits as defined by society, and women are prohibited from some certain tasks and privileges, not because they are female, but because we have labelled them as &#39;women&#39; and have rules for them in society.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Why is partriarchy so dominant throughout the world history? There are many theories, none fully satisfiable.<br />\nMuscle Power:<br />\n&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; First, men have more muscle power than women, only in general, and not in every case. But, women have more endurance, are more resistant to disease, hunger and fatigue. Second, those who really ruled were not because of their muscle. Also, social power was not directly propportional to the muscle power, instead it required social skills.<br />\n<strong>The&nbsp;Scum Of Society</strong>:<br />\n&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;that it is not the strength, but the aggression that men make women coerce. Women can match hatred, greed, and abuse, but when push comes to shove, the theory goes, men are more willing to engage in raw physical violence. In times of war, men&#39;s control of the armed forces has made them the masters of civilian society. Although commonly soldiers are men, does it mean that those who benefit from this have to be men too. In order to manage a war, you surely need stamina, but not physical strength or aggressiveness. It requires ability to maintain peace at home, acquire allies abroad, and understand what goes through&nbsp;the minds of enemies. Women are often stereotyped as better manipulators, appeasers, and are famed for having ability to see things from different perspective. So in general they make better politicians. Then why patriarchy still prevails?<br />\n<strong>Partiarchal Genes</strong>:&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />\n&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That evolution made us so. Men had to compete for the child. Women, on the other hand, had no problem finding a man willing to impregnate her. Also, once pregnant women required external help and became dependent on others. Hence evolution made them submissive. But why they made themselves dependent on men, and not the other women. Elephants and bonobo Chimapnzees also need external help, and so they form a cooperative network of females resulting in matriarchal society. Why not same for Homo Sapiens? Every social skill required to form social networks is more in women than men.&nbsp;<br />\nMaybe its because that common assumption is wrong, and men are superior in social skills, have greater tendency to cooperate.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>EMPIRES</strong>:</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp; .......</p>\n\n<p><strong>THE LAW OF RELIGION</strong>:</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Religion can be defined as a&nbsp;system of human norms and values that is founded on a belief in a superhuman order. This involves two distinct criteria:</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>Religions hold that there is a superhuman order, which is not product of human whims or agreements.&nbsp;</li>\n\t<li>Based on this superhuman order, religion establishes norms and values that it considers binding.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; Religion have potential to unite a large expanse of territory inhabitated by disparate groups of human beings under its aegis, a religion must possess two further qualities. It must be &quot;<em>universal</em>&quot; and &quot;<em>missionary</em>&quot;.&nbsp; &nbsp; Many local and tribal religions do not possess these two qualities and hence have not expanded.&nbsp;<br />\n&nbsp; When <em>Animism</em>&nbsp;was dominant belief, human norms and values had to take into consideration the outlook and interests of a multitude of other beings e.g. plants, animals, fairies,&nbsp;ghosts. When humans domesticated plants and animals, they found that some things were beyond their control, e.g. they could lock a sheep in pens, castrate rams and selectively breed ewes, but they could not control that the ewes conceived and gave birth to healthy lambs, nor they could stop epidemic.<br />\n&nbsp; The Gods offered solution for these problems. In exchange of everlasting devotion, Gods gave men mastery over plants and animals. The first chapters of the book Genesis give prime example for this.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;Polytheistic religions came into existence when people <em>discovered</em>&nbsp;that there is one God for one task e.g. God of Wat, God of Rain, God of Water etc. Fairies, ghosts which were major Gods in local religions did not just disappear, they just lost importance over time.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>The Benefits Of Idolatry</strong>:<br />\n&nbsp; &nbsp;We may now see polytheism as ignorant and childish idoltary. This is an unjust stereotype. We have to consider why Polytheism mattered so much in the first place. Most polytheists and even Animists recognised a supreme power above their gods. Fate (Moira, Ananke) in Greek. Olodumare in polytheistic religion Yoruba Of West Africa, Atman in Hindu religion.&nbsp;<br />\nPolytheism recoginizes the Supreme power, but the Supreme power is devoid of interests and biases, unconcerned with mundane desires, cares and worries of humans. Its pointless to ask this power for victory in war, for health, or for rain, because from its all-encompassing vantage point, it makes no difference whether a particular kingdom wins or loses, whether a particular city prospers or withers, whether a particular person recuperates or dies. The Greeks did not waste any sacrifices on Fate, and Hindus built no temples to&nbsp;Atman. The only reason to approach Supreme power of universe would be to renounce all worldly desires like Hindu sadhus.</p>\n\n<p>Polytheism stands in good light compared to Monotheist religions in terms of harmful effects on humanity. Roman empire had poytheistic religion, yet over its span Romans killed far less Monotheist Christians than Catholic christians and Protestant christians killed each other in just 24 hours. St Bartholomew&#39;s Day Massacre. The only conflict in their belief system was whether it is must to do good deeds for going to heaven, since God incarnated himself in flesh as Christ and suffered and redeemed for original sin. Protestants believed it was enough to have faith in Christ to go to heaven. Christians believed that it was also necessary to perform church rituals and good deeds.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp; How did monotheist religions came into power?<br />\n&nbsp; First known attempt: Pharaoh Akhenatten declared that one of the minor deities of the Egyptian pantheon, the god Aten, was in fact the supreme power of universe. Aten became the state god. But this was unsuccessful revolution ending after the death of Pharaoh.<br />\n&nbsp; Judaism: that supreme power had interests and biases and His chief interest was in tiny Jewish nation and obscure land of Israel.&nbsp;<br />\n&nbsp; Christianity: An esoteric Jewish sect sought to convince Jews that Jesus of Nazareth was their long-awaited messiah. This sect&#39;s leader Paul of Tarsus, reasoned that if supreme power of the universe has interests and biases, and if He had bothered to incarnate Himself in the flesh and to die on the cross for salvation of humankind, then this is something everyone should hear about, not just Jews. Hence actuating the expansion of Christianity. In a surprising twist, this esoteric Jewsih sect took over the mighty Roman Empire.<br />\n&nbsp; Islam: Appeared in the Arabian peninsula in the seventh century. In an even stranger and swifter twist, religion of some Arabics in remote corner of the world, spread across from Atlantic Ocean to India.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;Even with the Monotheism, polytheism survived. e.g. Christianity developed its own pantheon of Saints, whose cults differed little from polytheist Gods. e.g. England was protected by St George, Scotland by St Andrew, France by St Martin. Cities, professions and even diseases<br />\n&nbsp;Polytheism gave birth not merely to Monotheism, but also to Dualism. Dualist religions espouse the existence of two powers: good and evil. Unlike monotheism, dualism believes that evil is an independent power, neither created by good God, nor subordinate to it.&nbsp;<br />\n&nbsp; Dualism is a very attractive world view, because it has a short and simple answer to the famous Problem of Evil, &#39;Why is there evil in the world? Why is there suffering? Why do bad things happen to good people?&#39; Montheists have to practise intellectual gymnastics to explain how an omniscient, omnipotent, and perfectly good God allows so much suffering in the world. One well-known explanation is that this is God&#39;s way of allowing for human free-will. Were there no evil, humans could not choose between good and evil, and hence there would be no free will. This however, is a non-intuitive answer that immediately raises new questions. Freedom of will allows humans to choose evil. Many indeed choose evil and, according to the standard montheist account, this choice must bring divine punishment in its wake. If God knew in advance that a particular person would use her free will to choose evil, and that as a result she would be punished for this by eternal tortures in hell, why did God create her? Theologians have written countless books to answer these questions. Some find them convincing, some don&#39;t. What&#39;s undeniable is that Monotheists have hard time dealing with the Problem of Evil.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Dualism has answer to Problem Of Evil that there is a perpetual war going on between Good and Evil. But this concept is not all satisfying: if we talk about wars between two people for example if one throws other on the ground this is possible because of the law of Gravity (which is decreed by universal God, if we consider Montheism), but what are the laws governing the war between Good and Evil and who decreed them if we consider Dualism. It means, either there is no law( which seems less plausible), or the universe was created by one single power and He is evil himself, or Evil is just another concept created by us and there is no Evil in nature.</p>\n\n<p>Dualistic religions flourished for more than a thousand years. Zoroastrianism, Gnosticism, and Manichaenism. Manichaenism was once to&nbsp;take on Christianity. But it lost.&nbsp;Zoroastrianism was subsided by Muslims.&nbsp;<br />\nNeverthless, the rising of monotheism did not wipe out dualism. Instead it seems that monotheism took their concepts. e.g. there is concept of Satan (which can wreath havoc without God&#39;s permission), Hell in Christianity&nbsp;which is not present in Old Testament.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Laws Of Nature</strong>:</p>\n\n<p>Some religions focus on the Laws Of Nature, rather than the supreme power. e.g. Jainism, Buddhism (India), Daoism, Confucianism (China), Stoicism, Cynicism, Epicureanism (Mediterranean) basin. As per them Gods are subject to laws or nature, no less than humans, plants, animals. e.g Buddhism focusses on one principle Dhamma, that &quot;suffering arises from cravings&quot;, &quot;to liberate from suffering, you need to liberate from cravings&quot;, and &quot;to liberate from cravings, you need to train your mind to do so&quot;. Buddha, who came up with this idea, and gave a set of rules to attain this state of enlightenment (literal meaning, Extinguishing the fire - fire symbolises craving here). As per him, God may(does) exist, but even Gods can&#39;t make someone miserable if he has liberated from cravings, and even Gods can&#39;t help thim, if he is affected by fire of cravings. Gods might provide rain, wealth, but the suffering persists.<br />\nBut still 99% buddhists did not attain enlightenment, and turned to worshipping Buddha or many sects developed pantheons of Buddhas and bodhisattvas, offering prayers to them for mundane things.</p>\n\n<p><strong>The Worship Of Man</strong>:</p>\n\n<p>Communism, Capitalism, Nationalism and Nazism do not like to be called religions (rather Ideologies), but if we can classify Buddhism (which was not founded on basis of God) as religion, then we can similarly call these religions. Central figure in Communism would be Karl Marx, Friedrich Engels, and Vladimir Ilyich Lenin.&nbsp;<br />\nMost important of them is liberal humanism, which has Homo Sapiens as central figure. In eary modern Europe, murderers were thought to violate and destabilise cosmic order. To bring the cosmos back to balance, it was necessary to torture and publicly execute the criminal, so that everyone could see the order re-established. Today, murder is seen as a violation of sacred nature of human. In order to restore order, they do not execute or torture them, instead they punish the murderer in most humane way possible, thus safeguarding and even rebuilding human sanctity. By defending the murderer, we right what the murderer has wronged. (Socrates would reason in favor of it like this: If a painter sees someone paint poorly, would he torture the painter, or destroy all the paintings, or would try to fix the painting)</p>\n\n<p><strong>Socialist humanism</strong>: they believe that &#39;humanity&#39; is collective rather than individualistic. While liberalism seeks individual freedom as much as possible, socialists seek equality among humans. So, when riches are privileged over poor, it means that we value money more than the universal essence of all humans, which is the same for rich and poor alike.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Nazism focussed on evolutionary nature of humans, that human could possibly evolve into superhumans, and also devolve into subhumans. So it became necessary for them to flourish the topnotch race (which were Aryans, as per them), extinguish other races like Jews, blacks etc. Scientific studies at that time supported that Aryans (whites) were superior. Politicians adopted this. USA, Australia banned Chinese and Italians. Hitler took this too far to distinguish &quot;us&quot; and &quot;them&quot; and waged World War II. Racism became mainstream focus for them. World recognised that they had to fight against racism, racism started losing its grip, but slowly.</p>\n\n<p>Are we moving towards Ecological Disaster or Technological Paradise? We can only speculate, not foresee, because even if we see history backwards some things seem inevitable but were&nbsp;not obvious at that time, and also history is known to take&nbsp;unexpected turns time to time. There are two types of chaotic systems: (1) Level One Chaotic systems: which do not react to forecast e.g Weather, it would not change its course if we were able to predict it accurately. (2) Level Two Chaotic system: which react to predictions e.g Markets (if I were able to forecast the prices of tomorrow, it will disrupt the market and prices would not go as predicted). Cultures are like viruses that take advantage of hosts, are spread by hosts to other hosts sometimes killing them. (Marxism differs here).&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Memetics, Post Modernism, Game Theory suggest that cultural things can spread like viruses without benefitting anyone.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>The Discovery Of Ignorance</strong>:&nbsp;<br />\nScience</p>\n\n<p><strong>The Capitalist Creed</strong>:</p>\n\n<p>How imaginary money has &quot;helped&quot; society:</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp; Example: X wants to open Bakery, Y is contractor who can set it up. X gets loan from Bank B, hires Y. In future, when income comes X repays to B. Without money X will not have enough money to hire Y, and will never even be able to start the venture, unless Y wants to work free for until the bakery starts making money.<br />\n&nbsp;(<em>But in the light of this story, nothing could ever be achieved in past unless one person could do the entire business. Which is not true, there have been businesses in past successful.). So what changed? - TRUST, GREED, and FEAR..the trust is not between people now, trust is between enterprise (bank) and person.</em></p>\n\n<p>Egoism is Altruism: Greed is good, postulated by Adam Smith, a Scottish economist. That if a merchant becomes rich beyond the limit of providing for this family, he will hire more assistants and workers. And this in turn will increase collective happiness. But of course this is case only if money earned is used for further productivity. And after the invention of &quot;credit&quot; you can become rich without making someone else&nbsp;poor.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>There&#39;s a difference between Capital and Wealth. Capital is about money, goods and resources that are invested in production. Wealth is buried in the ground, or wasted on unproductive activities.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>AND THEY LIVED HAPPILY EVER AFTER</strong></p>\n\n<p>It is highly doubtful that Happiness is the goal for humanity, or rather there is any goal for humanity. As for Happiness, different ideologies have different understandings on&nbsp;how to increase happiness. Nationalists think political self-determination is essential for happiness, Communists think that everyone would be blissful under the dictatorship of the the proletariat, Capitalists think that only free market can ensure the greatest happiness of the greatest number by creating economic growth and material abundance and by teaching people to be self-reliant and enterprising.</p>\n\n<p>Two arguments: One that increase in human capabilities increases happiness. Other is the reverse of it, that increase in human capabilities implies increase in power, power corrupts and is ill-suited for our real needs.</p>\n\n<p>Science&#39;s contribution to happiness: Decrease in child mortality rate, Decrease in (violent) wars (maybe due to fear of Nuclear annihilation), Relief from dangerours and painful diseases.<br />\nAll of these have been seen only for a few years. Benfits of medicine seen not before 1850s, Mass famines continued till 20th century (During Commnist China&#39;s Great Leap Forward of 1958-61, somewhere between 10 and 50 million humans starved to death). International wars became rare only after 1945.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Even this brief golden age of the last half-century may has sown the seeds for future catastrophe: we have critically imbalanced ecological system. A lot of evidence indicates that we are destroying the foundations of human prosperity in an orgy of reckless consumption. Also, the accomplishments of sapiens have been at the expense of other animals.</p>\n\n<p>An impecunious invalid surrounded by a loving spouse, a devoted family and a warm community may well feel better than an alienated billionaire, provided that the invalid&#39;s poverty is not too sever and that his illness is not degenerative or painful.</p>\n\n<p>But the most important finding of all is that happiness does not really depend on objective conditions of either wealth, health or even community. Rather, it depends on the correlation between objective conditions and subjective expectations. If you want a bullock-cart and get bullock-cart, you are content. If you want a brand-new Ferrari and get only a second-hand Fiat you feel deprived. When things improve, expectations balloon, and consequently event dramatic improvements in objective conditions can leave us dissatisfied. When things deteriorate, expectations shrink, and consequently even a severe illness might leave you pretty much as happy as you were before.&nbsp; We moderners have an arsenal of tranquilizers and painkillers, but our expectations of ease and pleasure, and our intolerance of inconvenience and discomfort, have increased to such an extent that we may well suffer from pain more than our ancestors ever did.</p>\n\n<p>But this line of thinking is difficult for people. The problem is a fallacy of reasoning embedded deep in our psyches. When we try to guess or imagine how happy other people are now, or how people in past were, we inevitably imagine ourselves in their shoes. But that won&#39;t work because it pastes our expectations on to the material conditions of others.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Example in today&#39;s affluent societies it is customary to change clothes after shower. In medieval times peasants went without washing for months on end, and hardly ever changed their clothes. Even the thought of living like this is unbearable for us, yet they didn&#39;t mind. They were used to it. It&#39;s not that they wanted change of clothes and couldn&#39;t get it - they had what they wanted.</p>\n\n<p>If expectations decide happiness then media and internet has a great hand in increasing our expectations and decreasing happiness. So maybe the Third Word discontent is fomented not merely by poverty, disease, corruption and political oppression but also by mere exposure to the First World standards.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>What if immortality is discovered? Today the only thing that&#39;s even for both rich and poor is certain death. This will not be the case then.</p>\n\n<p>Happiness from the perspective of biology and evolution: Happiness is caused by sensations (dopamine and other chemicals, nerves, senses, neurons etc.. are participants), evolution attached sensations with the productive activities like sex. Genetics may attach a window of happiness level biologically e.g. some people are born with window of happiness level 6 to 10. They will be most of the times cheerful on matter what. Some are born with window of level 1 to 6, they might always remain depressed no matter what. Any factor that increases happiness may modify the level of happiness for a fleeting moment, but the way their brains have been engineered, the level will swing back to original.</p>\n\n<p>A meaningful life is a happier life <em>overall</em>. But all meanings are delusional, a soldier declaring that his life is meaningful because he fights to defend his homeland, a scientist saying her life is meaningful because she increases the store of knowledge, enterpreneur who finds meaning in building new companies to solve problems is no less delusional than their medieval counterparts who found meaning in reading sculptures, going on a crusade or building a new cathedral. Even the concept of afterlife is delusional but it has potential of ascribing meaning to someone&#39;s life and hence happiness.</p>\n\n<p>What is good and what is bad, what is beautiful and what is ugly, what ought to be and what ought not to be, are all determined by what each one of us feels.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h2>Stories From Tagore</h2>\n\n<p>Short but powerful tragic stories with a pich of philosophy.</p>\n\n<p><strong>1. The Cabuliwallah:</strong></p>\n\n<p>How a friendly bond develops between Cabuliwallah and a little girl... How Cabuliwallah saw his own daughter (who was the same age as this girl, far away in his country) in that little girl...(How Cabulliwallah ended up in jail for a long time)&nbsp; How that little girl who cried to see Cabuliwallah almost completely forgot when grew up and found new friends, and didn&#39;t bother much when Cabulliwallah went to see her again after getting out of jail...</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>2. The Home-Coming:</strong></p>\n\n<p>How a mother thinks that she can&#39;t bear his own child because of his misbehavious... How the child thinks that he should get away from his mother (and his younger brother, who is more favoured by the mother)... How he gets the opportunity... How he sees humiliation in the new environment away from his mother (because he is not bright, because his aunt doesn&#39;t like him living in their house etc)... How he craves for the mother&#39;s affection again (for any love for that matter)... How he gets into miserable condition (falls ill), how the mother cries and realises the love she has for his son (after seeing him in misely)...</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>3. Once There Was A King:</strong></p>\n\n<p>&quot;When we were young, we understood all sweet things, and we could detect the sweets of a fairy story by an unerring science of our own. We never cared for such useless things as knowledge. We only cared for truth. And our unsophisticated little hearts knew well where the Crystal Palace of Truth may lay and how to reach it. But to-day we are expected to write pages of facts, while the truth is simply this: &quot;There was a king&quot;&quot;</p>\n\n<p>&quot;For I was quite ready to believe that there was no other need for rain except to protect one helpless boy one evening in one corner of Calcutta from the deadly clutches of his tutor&quot; <em>[Even adult people think like this when they think their prayers have been answered]</em></p>\n\n<p>&quot;But the child&#39;s faith never admits defeat, and it would snatch at the mantle of death itself to turn him back. It would be outrageous for him to think that such a story of one teacherless evening could so suddenly come to a stop. Therefore the grandmother had to call back her story from the ever-shut chamber of the great End, but she does it so simply on a banana ste on the river, and having some incantations read by a magician. But in that rainy night and in the dim light of a lamp death loses all its horror in the mind of the boy, and seems nothing more than a deep slumber of a single night. When the story ends the tired eyelids are weighed down with the sleep. Thus it is that we send the little body of the child floating on the back of sleep over the still water of time, and then in the morning read a few verses of incantation to restore him to the world of life and light&quot;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>4. The Child&#39;s Return</strong></p>\n\n<p>Story of a servant who raised his master, and then the master&#39;s son... How he gets so attached to the master&#39;s son... How the boy dies due to a minor mistake of the servant, and how is accused of having kidnapped the child... How the servant has a newborn son after that, how he thinks his little master has returned from the dead in the form of his own son... How he raises this child like a noble (rich) kid even though he keeps himself starvning... How the kid grows and is even ashamed of his father (as he always acts like a servant)... How the servant thinks that it&#39;s his duty to give away his own son the master (due to his belief that he is re-incarnation of his little master)... How he lies that he had kidnapped the master&#39;s son and gives away his own child,...</p>\n\n<p>&quot;When Phailna saw that he was the wealthy magistrate&#39;s son, and not Raichanran&#39;s, he was angry at first, thinking that he had been cheated all this time of his birthright. But seeing Raicharan in distress, he generously said to his father: &quot;Father, forgive him. Even if you don&#39;t let him live with us, let him have a small monthly pension.&quot;&nbsp; After hearing this, Raicharan did not utter another word. He looked for the last time on the face of his son. He made obeisance to his old master and mistress. Then he went out and was mingled with the numberless people of the world. At the end of the month Anukul sent him some money to the village. But the money came back. There was no one there of the name Raicharan&quot;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>5. Master Mashai</strong></p>\n\n<p>Story of a poor young man hired as tutor to a miser person&#39;s little son. How he and his pupil became great friends. &quot;Never before did Haralal have such an opportunity of loving any young human creature. His mother had been so poor and dependent, that he had never had the privilege of playing with the children where she was employed at work. He had not hitherto suspected the hidden stores of love which lay all the while accumulating in his own heart.&quot;.. How he then resigned from his tutor post after an incident of theft in the house.. How the boy was so attached to him.. How later on he found a job.. &quot;H rented a small house in a narrow lane and brought his mother to live with him as soon as his salary was raised to forty rupees a month. Thus happiness came back to his mother after weary years of waiting&quot;... How he connected with the boy again after the boy&#39;s mother&#39;s death. How that boy deceived him and took money (which was the company&#39;s money under his custody), and how it had a tragic effect on him because then he was accused of theft afterwards...(and probably died)</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Haralal laid his throbbing head on the side of the open window of the carriage and closed his eyes. Slowly all the pain abated. His body became cool. A deep and intense peace filled his heart and supreme deliverance seemed to embrace him on every side. It was <em>not</em> true, &mdash; the day&#39;s despair which threatened him with its grip of utter helplessness. It was <em>not</em> true, it was false. He knew now that it was only an empty fear of the mind. Deliverance was in the infinite sky and there was no end to peace. No king or queen emperor in the world had the power to keep captive this nonentity, this Haralal. In the sky, surrounding his emancipated heart on every side, he felt the presence of his mother, that one poor woman. She seemed to grow and grow till she filled the infinity of darkness. All the roads and buildings and shops of Calcutta gradually became enveloped by her. In here presence vanished all the aching pains and thoughts and consciousness of Haralal. It burst, &mdash;that bubble filled with the hot vapour of pain. And now there was neither darkness nor light, but only one tense fullness. The Cathedral clock struck one. The driver called out impatiently: &quot;Babu, my horse can&#39;t go on any longer. Where do you want to go?&quot; There came no answer... And the answer was never received from Haralal, where he wanted to go&quot;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h2><span style=\"font-family:Lucida Sans Unicode,Lucida Grande,sans-serif;\">How To Win Friends And Colleagues</span></h2>\n\n<p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">Choose Appreciation over Criticism &nbsp;(+) &gt; (-).</p>\n\n<p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">Everyone craves&nbsp;to feel important, everyone likes compliment.
