Why be Just and Good, when being Unjust and Bad has so many advantages?<br />\nCan we create a <em>perfect</em> state&nbsp;where Justice, Courage etc are virtues of the state? Would everyone be happy in this state?</div>\n\n<p><br />\nPlato seeks to imagine a state which will be perfectly Just, and seeks to answer these questions in his&nbsp;Book &quot;Republic&quot;. Below is the extract from the book. My comments are highlighted in blue.</p>\n\n<h2>Book Extract</h2>\n\n<p>Scholars at that time claimed that: &quot;<strong><em>Justice is paying your debts</em>&quot;.</strong><br />\n&nbsp; &nbsp; A friend gives me a gun to keep when he is <em>sane</em>; returns back and demands the gun back&nbsp;but only this time he is <em>insane</em>.<br />\n&nbsp; &nbsp; Is it Just, that I repay and give the gun back?<br />\n<span style=\"color:#0000cc;\"><em>[WHY IS IT NOT JUST? - Because it would spread &amp; cause opposite of good. SO, CAN WE SAY THAT JUST IS WHATEVER THAT BRINGS GOOD TO YOU AND EVERYBODY AROUND YOU?]</em></span></p>\n\n<p><br />\n&nbsp;&quot;<em>Justice is doing good to friend and evil to the enemy.</em>&quot;<br />\n&nbsp; &nbsp; We sometimes have friends who are not good and have enemies who are actually good, but we somehow misunderstood them.&nbsp;<br />\n&nbsp; &nbsp; Is it just that&nbsp;I do good to a bad person, but bad to a good person?</p>\n\n<p><strong>&quot;<em>Justice is doing good to friends when they are good and evil to enemies when they are bad</em>&quot;</strong><br />\n&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br />\n<em><strong>&quot;Justice is what is advantageous to the stronger</strong></em>&quot;&nbsp; - Tyranny, Monarchy, Democracy, Aristocracy each sets down some rules/laws which the weaker have to follow. They set laws as per their advantage, hence Justice is what is advantageous to the stronger.<br />\n&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Rulers may make mistakes...<br />\n&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;So when people follow the rules which the ruler thought was advantageous for them but was not actually advantageous; when people follow these laws aren&#39;t they working against the advantage of the ruler(stronger). <em>Means people are doing justice, but it is not advantageous to the stronger in this case</em>.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; [Counter] <em>The ruler in a precise sense would not make mistake</em>.</p>\n\n<p><br />\n&nbsp; &nbsp; &quot;The doctor in a precise sense is a doctor because of money making or because of the art of curing the sick?<br />\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The captain in a precise sense is a sailor because of sailing or because of the art of leading the sailors?<br />\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Medicine does not contain the advantage of the medicine itself, but the body<br />\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;horsemanship consider the advantage of horsemanship, but of horses<br />\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Nor does any other art consider its own advantage&mdash;for it doesn&#39;t have any further need to&mdash;but the advantage of that of which it is the art for.&quot;<br />\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />\n&nbsp; &nbsp; &quot;Then, there is no kind of knowledge that considers or commands the advantage of the stronger, but rather of what is weaker and ruled by it.&quot;<br />\n&nbsp; &nbsp; <span style=\"color:#8e44ad;\"><strong><em>(</em></strong><em>Socrates makes&nbsp;an analogy of art here, to show that True ruler would not work for his advantage, instead of for advantage of those whom he is ruling.</em><strong><em>)</em></strong></span></p>\n\n<p><br />\n&nbsp; &nbsp; &quot;You suppose shepherds or cowherds consider the good of the sheep or the cows and fatten them and take care of them looking to something other than their masters&#39; good and their own; and so you also believe that the rulers in the cities, those who truly rule, think&nbsp;about the ruled differently from the way a man would regard sheep,&quot;<br />\n<em>&nbsp; &nbsp; <span style=\"color:#8e44ad;\">( makes an analogy of Shepherds here, to show that though they take care of sheep, but for their own sake, and not for the sheeps&#39; sake)</span></em></p>\n\n<p><br />\n&nbsp; &nbsp; &quot;The just man everywhere has less than the unjust man. First, in <em>contracts</em>, when the just man is a partner of the unjust man, you will always find that&nbsp;at the dissolution of the partnership the just man does not have more&nbsp;than the unjust man, <em>but less</em>. Second, in matters pertaining to the city,&nbsp;when there are taxes, the just man <em>pays more</em> on the basis of equal property,&nbsp;the unjust man less; and when there are distributions, the one makes no profit, the other much. And, further, when each holds some ruling&nbsp;office, even if the just man suffers no other penalty, it is his lot to see&nbsp;his domestic affairs deteriorate from neglect, while he gets no advantage&nbsp;from the public store, thanks to his being just; in addition to&nbsp;this, he incurs the ill of his relatives and his acquaintances when he&nbsp;is unwilling to serve them against what is just.&quot;<br />\n<em>&nbsp; &nbsp; <span style=\"color:#8e44ad;\">(shows here how Just men are always at loss in common scenarios; and unjust are in benefit)</span></em></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; So, Socrates, injustice, when it comes into being on a sufficient scale, is mightier, freer, and more masterful than justice; and,&nbsp;as I have said from the beginning, the just is the advantage of the&nbsp;stronger, and the unjust is what is profitable and advantageous for&nbsp;oneself.<br />\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />\n&nbsp; &nbsp; &quot;You talking about shepherds, but u did not consider <em>shepherd in a precise sense</em>, shepherds own advantage&nbsp;<br />\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Doesn&#39;t every art come with a peculiar benefit..<br />\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;A doctor is not a doctor because of the money he makes, even though he does (which is art of wage-earner),&nbsp;<br />\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;A true ruler who is ruler in precise sense, asks for wage, because he will never do what&#39;s best for himself instead whats best for those who are ruled.<br />\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;A true ruler rules not for the love of money, honor but because of the fear that if they don&#39;t rule&nbsp;someone worse will.&quot;<br />\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<cite>The penalty for good people for being unwilling to participate in politics is that they end up being ruled<br />\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; by inferiors.</cite><br />\n&nbsp; &nbsp; &quot;In a city of good men, men will fight over not ruling just as today they fight over the ruling. everyone who knows would choose to be benefited by another rather than to take the trouble of benefiting another.&quot;<br />\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />\n&nbsp; &nbsp; &quot;Now about the life of unjust being superior...<br />\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Do you assert that perfect injustice is more profitable than justice when it is perfect?&quot;<br />\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Are the unjust in your opinion good as well as prudent, Thrasymachus?&quot;<br />\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Yes, those who can do injustice perfectly,&quot; he said, &quot;and are able to subjugate cities and tribes of men to themselves.&quot;<br />\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;in your opinion would the just man be willing to get the better of the just man in anything&quot;<br />\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;No&quot;<br />\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;the just man wants, and claims he deserves, to get the better of the unjust and not of&nbsp; the (other) just man?&quot;<br />\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Yes&quot;<br />\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;And what about the unjust man? Does he claim he deserves to get the better of the just man and the just action?&quot;<br />\n&nbsp; &nbsp; &quot;Then will the unjust man also get the better of the unjust human being and action, and will he struggle to take most of all for himself?&quot;<br />\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Yes&quot;<br />\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Then the man who is both good and wise will not want to get the better of the like, but of the unlike and opposite?&quot;<br />\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;But the bad and unlearned will want to get the better of both the like and the opposite?&quot;<br />\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;does our unjust man get the better of both like and unlike? Weren&#39;t you saying that?&quot;<br />\n<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;It means unjust is bad and unlearned</em>.<br />\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><em><strong>The just lives a poor life and unjust lives a happy and prosperous life.</strong></em></p>\n\n<p>&quot;...is there anything with which you could see other than eyes?&nbsp;Could you hear with anything other than ears?&quot;<br />\n&quot;No&quot;<br />\n&quot;you could cut a slip from a vine with a dagger or a leather-cutter or many other things?&nbsp;But I suppose you could not do as fine a job with anything other than a pruning knife made for this purpose.&quot; - &quot;Yes&quot;</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Then can we establish that &quot;<em>each thing has a virtue</em>&quot; that there is a work for each thing that it alone can do or can do more finely than other things?<br />\nCould eyes do a fine job if they&nbsp;did not have their proper virtue but, instead of the virtue, vice? whatever their virtue may be.&nbsp;Similarly for other things.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Come, let&#39;s consider this now: <em>is there some work of a soul that you couldn&#39;t ever accomplish with any other thing that is</em>? For example, managing, ruling, and deliberating, and all such things&mdash;could we justly attribute them to anything other than a soul and assert that they are peculiar to it?&quot;<br />\n&quot;And, further, what about living? Shall we not say that it is the work of a soul?&quot;</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Then the just soul and the just man will have a good life, and the unjust man a bad one. And the man who lives well is blessed and happy, and the man&nbsp;who does not is the opposite.&quot;<br />\n<em>&quot;Then the just man is happy and the unjust man wretched.&quot;</em></p>\n\n<p><em>&quot;Then injustice is never more profitable than justice.&quot;</em></p>\n\n<p><strong>Arguments in favor of injustice:</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>Popular View of nature and origin of justice</li>\n\t<li>People practice justice do so against there will, out of necessity and not for good</li>\n\t<li>Their approach makes sense, cuz they believe the life of the unjust is far better than of just</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>&quot;They believe doing injustice is good, suffering injustice is bad; however bad outweighs the good. Once they experience bad, they conclude its impossible to&nbsp;escape the bad and obtain the good. So they avoid doing injustice, in order to avoid suffering.&quot;<br />\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<strong><em>So basically justice is not good, but the lesser evil.</em></strong><br />\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />\n<em>Example</em> to assert this:<br />\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Suppose a just and an unjust man get the robe of invisibility. Nobody will remain just in this situation. Actions of the just will be no different than that of unjust.<br />\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br />\n<em>&nbsp; &nbsp; Whenever people can be safely unjust, they will be unjust.</em><br />\n&nbsp; &nbsp; &quot;Imagine a person who never does any wrong or never touches anything that isn&#39;t his. Most people would consider him a fool.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &quot;Unjust is considered to be just and hence can rule, pursuing self-interest, not caring about others. In every public or private struggle.&nbsp;&nbsp;The unjust person wins at other people&#39;s expense. The unjust person can offer more to gods and hence even Gods are happier with him.&quot;<br />\n&nbsp;<br />\n-------------------------</p>\n\n<p><br />\n<em>People are told be just, not for the sake of justice, but the beneficial consequences of it</em>: powerful positions, good marriages, and all the&nbsp; other benefits which go to unjust too, they are told that Gods are more generous to the Just people (in spite of the fact that unjust can offer more to Gods).</p>\n\n<p>&quot;With two such men (perfect Just, and perfect Unjust) it&#39;s no longer hard, I suppose, to complete the speech by a description of the kind of life that awaits each. <em>[BUT IN REAL WORLD NOTHING IS PERFECT]</em> It must be told, then. And if it&#39;s somewhat ( rustically told, don&#39;t suppose that it is I who speak, Socrates, but rather those who praise injustice ahead of justice. They&#39;ll say that the just man who has such a disposition will be whipped; he&#39;ll be racked; he&#39;ll be bound; he&#39;ll have both his eyes burned out; and, at the end, when he&nbsp;has undergone every sort of evil, he&#39;ll be crucified and know that one shouldn&#39;t wish to be, but to seem to be, just. After all, Aeschylus&#39; saying<br />\napplies far more correctly to the unjust man. For really, they will say, it is the unjust man, because he pursues a thing dependent on truth and does not live in the light of opinion, who does not wish to seem unjust but to be unjust. Reaping a deep furrow in his mind from which trusty plans bear fruit. First, he rules in the city because he seems to be just. Then he takes in marriage from whatever station he wants and gives in marriage to whomever he wants; he contracts and has partnerships with whomever he wants, and, besides benefiting himself in all this, he gains because he has no qualms about doing injustice. So then, when he enters contests, both private and public, he wins and gets the better of his enemies. In getting the better, he is wealthy and does good to friends and harm to enemies. To the gods he makes sacrifices and sets up votive offerings, adequate and magnificent, and cares for the gods and those human beings he wants to care for far better than the just man. So, in all likelihood, it is also more appropriate for him to be dearer to the gods than is the just man. Thus, they say, Socrates, with gods and with humans, a better life is provided for the unjust man than for the just man.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>&quot;As for some blameless king who in fear of the gods upholds justice, the black earth bears barley and wheat, the trees are laden with fruit. The sheep bring forth without fail and the<br />\nsea provides fish.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Vice in abundance is easy to choose,&nbsp;the road is smooth and it lies very near. While the gods have set sweat before virtue. And it is a long road, rough and steep. &quot;</p>\n\n<p>&quot;The very gods can be moved by prayer too. With sacrifices and gentle vows and the odor of burnt and drink offerings, human beings turn them aside with their prayers. When someone has transgressed and made a mistake. with justice or with crooked deceits scale the higher wall&#39; where I can fortify myself all around and live out<br />\nmy life? For the things said indicate that there is no advantage in my being just, if I don&#39;t also seem to be, while the labors and penalties involved are evident. But if I&#39;m unjust, but have provided myself with a reputation for justice, a divine life is promised. Therefore, since as the wise make plain to me, &#39;<em>the seeming overpowers even the truth</em>&#39;&nbsp;and is the master of happiness, one must surely turn wholly to it. As facade and exterior I must draw a shadow painting&nbsp;of virtue all around me, while behind it I must trail the wily and subtle fox of the most wise Archilochus.&#39;&#39;<br />\n&quot;&#39;But,&#39; says someone, &#39;it&#39;s not always easy to do bad and get&nbsp;away with it unnoticed.&#39; &#39;Nothing great is easy,&#39; we&#39;ll say.&quot;</p>\n\n<p><cite>THE APPEARANCE IS THE MASTER OF TRUTH AND THE LORD OF HAPPINESS.</cite></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#8e44ad;\">Socrates describes how republic is formed starting from a few essential people like farmer (for providing food) etc (why one work for one individual, because that is efficient, one word for naturally suited candidate), adding up people of different kinds,&nbsp;and how because of our expanding needs we need to expand the cities, and wage wars, and how we come to need guardians. True guardians need to be noble to the friends (people of the Republic) and harmful to enemies&nbsp;i.e. they need to be a combination of a philosopher&#39;s knowledge and high spirited physical strength.&nbsp;We need to educate them properly so that the achieve both virtues.</span><br />\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />\n&quot;Love of learning is philosophy, love of wisdom.<br />\n<em>Dogs have qualities of a true philosopher, because dogs distinguish the face of a friend from the face of a stranger, by the criteria of knowing and&nbsp;not knowing.&quot;</em></p>\n\n<p><em>&quot;</em>We begin by telling children stories that are mostly false, but contain a grain of truth.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>&quot;We should not tell stories to the young people, which break the republic (e.g. the stories of war among Gods). We should tell them that there have not been&nbsp;instances of quarrels among people of the republic .&quot;<br />\n<em>(Socrates proposes that we need to educate children in Good and Justice, even if we have to modify stories, adding a grain of falsehood).</em></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br />\n&quot;The god must surely always be described such as he is, whether one presents him in epics, lyrics, or tragedies.&quot;<br />\n&quot;Then, is the god really good, and, hence, must he be said to be so?&quot;<br />\n&quot;Well, but none of the good things is harmful, is it?&quot;<br />\n&quot;Does that which does not harm do any evil?&quot;<br />\n&quot;That which does no evil would not be the cause of any evil?&quot;</p>\n\n<p>&quot;What about this? Is the good beneficial?&quot;<br />\n&quot;Then it&#39;s the cause of doing well?&quot;<br />\n&quot;Then the <em>good is not the cause of everything; rather it is the cause of the things that are in a good way</em>, while it is not responsible for the bad things.&quot;<br />\n&quot;Saying that God punished him by endowing misery and penalty is wrong. We are right in saying that because the man was wretched he deserved&nbsp;penalty and misery, but God being caused to suffering for anyone is like denying the true being of God.&quot;<br />\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />\n&quot;Then, the god, since he&#39;s good, wouldn&#39;t be the cause of everything, as the many say, but the cause of a few things for human beings and not responsible for most. For the things that are good for us are far fewer than those that are bad; and of the good things, no one else must be said to be the cause; of the bad things, some other causes must be sought and not the god.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Isn&#39;t it necessary that, if something steps out of&nbsp;its own idea, it be changed either by itself or something else?&quot;</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Are things that are in the best condition least altered and moved by something else&mdash;for example, a body by food, drink, and labor, and all plants by the sun&#39;s heat, winds, and other affections of the sort; aren&#39;t the healthiest and strongest least altered?&quot;</p>\n\n<p>&quot;And a soul that is most courageous and most prudent, wouldn&#39;t an external&nbsp;affection least trouble and alter it?&quot;</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Now, the god and what belongs to the god are in every way in the best condition.&quot;<br />\n&quot;So, in this way, the god would least of all have many shapes.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>&quot;But would he be the one to transform and alter himself?&quot;<br />\n&quot;Does he transform himself into what&#39;s better and fairer, or what&#39;s worse and uglier than himself?&quot;<br />\n&quot;Necessarily into what&#39;s worse, if he&#39;s altered at all. c For surely we won&#39;t say that the god is wanting in beauty or virtue.&quot;<br />\n&quot;Then it&#39;s impossible, for a god to want to alter himself, but since, as it seems, each of them is as fair and as good as possible, he remains forever simply in his own shape.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Then, you best of men,&quot; I said, &quot;let none of the poets tell us that the gods, like wandering strangers. Take on every sort of shape and visit the cities&quot;</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Would a god want to lie, either in speech or deed by presenting an illusion?&quot;<br />\n&quot;Don&#39;t you know, that all gods and human beings hate the true lie?&quot;</p>\n\n<p>&quot;I mean that to lie and to have lied to the soul about the things that are, and to be unlearned, and to have and to hold a lie there is what everyone would least accept; and that everyone hates a lie in that place most of all.&quot;<br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><em>(Socrates demonstrates how the stories regarding Gods in which he punishes people, takes different forms like a magician and causes havoc do not make sense, because A True Good Thing Will Cause Only Good, And since God is the best version of it, It Would Not Transform Into Any Other Form).</em></p>\n\n<p>&quot;Then the god is altogether simple and true in deed and speech, and he doesn&#39;t himself change or deceive others by illusions, speeches, or the sending of signs either in waking or dreaming.&quot;</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#8e44ad;\">Socrates reasons why we should ban speeches which tell things about &quot;underworld&quot; for that will make guardians fearful to death,&nbsp;also speeches which make them think the bribes (offerings to Gods, kings) get things done. We should ban the literature which portrays heroes and sons of Gods which doing unholy and horrible things. We should not give the idea&nbsp;that Gods are perpetrators of evil and Gods and heroes are no better than ordinary people.</span></p>\n\n<p><br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n","authorId":null,"subject":"philosophy","tags":null,"img":"http://www.loyalbooks.com/image/detail/Platos-Republic-Plato.jpg","summary":null,"lastUpdated":"2018-04-29T16:12:51.055+0000"}
