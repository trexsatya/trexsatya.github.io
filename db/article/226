{"name":"Analytical Psychology","id":226,"content":"<h2>Collected Papers On Analytical Psychology</h2>\n\n<p>Book by Carl Jung.</p>\n\n<p>In second edition of the book, Carl Jung addresses the criticism raised towards the first book. Even though he sympathises with the critics of his &quot;causal viewpoint in psychology&quot;, he finds it necessary.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;In my opinion, the nature of human mind compels us to take the final point of view. For it cannot be disputed that, psychologically speaking, we are living and working, day by day, according the principle of directed aim or purpose, as well as that of causality. What is plainly directed towards a goal cannot be given an exclusively causalistic explanation, otherwise we should be led to the conclusion expressed in Moleshott&#39;s famous enunciation: Man <em>is</em>, what he eats.&quot; &quot;We must bear the fact in mind that <em>causality is a point of view</em>&quot;.</p>\n\n<p>It affirms the inevitable and immutable relation of a series of events: a-b-d-z. Since this relation is fixed, and according to the view-point must necessarily be so, looked at logically the order may also be reversed. <em>Finality is also a point of view,&nbsp;</em>that is justified empirically solely by the existence of series of events, wherein the causal connection is indeed evident, <em>but the meaning of which only becomes intelligible as producing final effect</em>.</p>\n\n<p>The causal explanation must be mechanistic, if we are not to postulate a metaphysical entity as first cause. For instance, if we adopt Freud&#39;s sexual theory and assign primary importance psychologically to the function of the genital glands, the brain is viewed as an appendage of the genital glands. If we approach the Viennese idea of sexuality with all its vague omnipotence, and trace it in a strictly scientific manner down to its psychological basis, we shall arrive at the first cause, according to which psychic life is for the most, or the most important part, tension and relaxatino of the genital glands.</p>\n\n<p>If we assume that this mechanistic explanation be &quot;true&quot;, it would be the sort of truth which is exceptionally tiresome and rigidly limited in scope. A similar statement would be that the genital glands cannot function without adequate nourishment, with its inference that sexuality is an appendage-function of nutrition! The truth contained in this is really an important chapter in the biology of lower forms of life.</p>\n\n<p>If we wish to work in a really psychological way, we shall want to know the <em>meaning</em> of pscyhological phenomena. After learning the kinds of steel the various parts of a locomotive are maded of, and from what ironworks and mines they come, we do not really know anything about the locomotive&#39;s <em>function</em>, that is to say, its <em>meaning</em>. But &quot;function&quot; as conceived by modern science is&nbsp;by no means solely a causal concept; it is especially a final or &quot;teleological&quot; one. For it is utterly impossible to consider the soul from the causal view-point only; we are obliged to consider it from the final point of view.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Kant showed very clearly that the mechanistic and the teleolgoical view-points are not constituent (objective) principles, in some degree qualities of the object, but that they are purely regulative (subjective) principles of thought, and as such they are not mutually inconsistent. I can for example, easily conceive the following thesis and antithesis:&mdash;</p>\n\n<p><em>Thesis</em>: Everything came into existence according to mechanistic laws.</p>\n\n<p><em>Antithesis</em>: Some things did not come into existence according to mechanistic laws only.</p>\n\n<p>Kant says to this: Reason cannot prove either of these principles, because <em>a priori</em> purely empirical laws of nature cannot give us a determinative principle regarding the potentiality of things.</p>\n\n<p>Analogy with Physics, the concept of an energy that tends towards relief of tension, and therewith also towards a definite final state.</p>\n\n<p>Since Kant&#39;s time we have come to know that the two view-points (causal and final) are not antagonistic if they are regarded as regulative principles of thought, and not as constituent principles of the process of nature itself.</p>\n\n<p>Jung sheds some light on difference between the Vienna School and Zurich School of thoughts on psychology. While the former ties it to sexuality and perceives in a causal model(&quot;it interprets the psychological symbol semiotically, as a sign of token of certain primitive psychosexual processes. Its method is analytical and causal.&quot;) Zurich School does not interpret the psychological symbol semiotically only, but also symbolistically, that is, it attributes a positive value to the symbol. The value does not depend merely on historical causes; its chief importance lies in the fact that it has a meaning for the actual present, and for the future, in their psychological aspects. It is not merely a sign of something repressed and concealed, but is at the same time an attempt to comprehend and to point out the way of further psychological development of the individual. So, this method is not only analytical and causal, but also synthetic and prospective, in recognition that human mind is characterised by &quot;cause&quot; and also by &quot;fines&quot; (aims).</p>\n\n<p>There are two types of psychology, the one following the principle of hedonism, and the other following the principle of power. Scientific materialism is pertinent to the former type, and the philosophy of Nietzsche to the latter. The principle of the Freudian theory is hedonism, while that of Adler (one of Freud&#39;s earliest perssonal pupils) is founded upon the principles of power.</p>\n\n<p>It is impossible to live according to the intimations of infantile hedonism, or according to a childish desire for power. If these are to be retained they must be taken symbolically. Out of the symbolic application of infantile trends, an attitude evolves which may be termed philosophical or religious, and these terms characterise sufficiently the lines of further development of the individual. The individual is not only an established and unchangeable complex of psychological facts, but also an extremely changeable entity. By exclusive reduction to causes, the primitive trends of a personality are reinforced; this is only helpful when at the same time these primitive tendencies are balanced by recognition of their symbolic value. Analysis and reduction lead to causal truth; this by itself does not help living, but brings about resignation and hopelessness. On the other hand, the recognition of the intrinsic value of a symbol leads to constructive truth and helps us to live.</p>\n\n<p>The functional importance of the symbol is clearly shown in the history of civilisation. For thousands of years the religious symbol proved a most efficacious means in the moral education of mankind. Only a prejudiced mind could deny such an obvious fact. Concrete values cannot take the place of the symbol; only new and more efficient symbols can be substituted for those that are antiquated and outworn, such as have lost their efficacy through the progress of intellectual analysis and understanding. Further development of mankind can only be brought about by means of symbols which represent something far in advance of himself, and whose intellectual meanings cannot yet be grasped entirely. The individual unconscious produces such symbols, and they are of the greatest possible value in the moral development of the personality.</p>\n\n<p>Man almost invariably has philosophical and religious views of the meaning of the world and of his own life. There are some who are proud to have none. These are exceptions putside the common path of mankind; they miss and important function which has proved itself to be indispensable to the human mind. In such cases we find in the unconscious, instead of modern symbolism, an antiquated archaic view of the world and of life. If a requisite psychological function is not represented in the sphere of consciousness, it exists in the unconscious in the form of an archaic or embryonic prototype.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>The (Word) Association Method:</p>\n\n<p>In this method the psychotherapist asks the patient &quot;tell me whatever comes to your mind when I say the following word&quot;. The list of words is curated consisting of <em>Stimulus Words</em>. In his book Carl Jung presents such a list. It has been observed that hysteric people respond slowly to such asks, not because of lack of intelligence. Jung mentions that his patients were highly intelligent. The increase in response time is because of the emotions.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Any psychic occurence is never a thing in itself, but is always the resultant of entire psychological past&quot;</p>\n\n<p>If we put patients in a &quot;real&quot; scenario (or a good simulation) it would be even better for exploring their minds.</p>\n\n<p>If a person fails to respond to some stimulus word, it means either no idea is coming to his mind, or a lot of ideas are coming to his mind.</p>\n\n<p>Neurotic people respond with a lot of words in association to some stimulus words. They go on to list different words till they reach one that is satisfactory to them. This gives us a hint of general behaviour of neurotic people: they have constant tendency to give to others more feelings than is required or expected, more promises, too much enthusiastic attachment, they take everything personally (e.g. instead of reacting to stimulus word by uttering a single word, they utter few sentences like they have take it personally). Object-libido as Freud referred to it.</p>\n\n<p>For therapist it becomes hard to deal with neurotic people because they first enamour him to an extent that they follow blindly his instructions, but soon this is lost and they start giving blind resistance to whatever he is saying. This makes difficult to exert educative influence on them.</p>\n\n<p>Experimental Psychology for crime investigations.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Every human mind contains much that is unacknowledged and hence unconscious as such; and no one can boast that the stands completely above his complexes. Those who persist in maintaining that thye can, are not aware of the spectacles upon their noeses&quot;</p>\n\n<p>In Association method, uneducated respond to stimulus words based on emotions.</p>\n\n<p>Three principle types that come out in such sessions:-</p>\n\n<ol>\n\t<li>An objective type with undisturbed reactions</li>\n\t<li>A so-called complex-type with many disturbances in the experiment occasioned by the constellation of a complex.</li>\n\t<li>A so-called definition type. The reaction always gives an explanation or a definition of stimulus word.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Defintion types are either stupid or someone who tries to look smarter than they are. The have what is called &quot;intelligence-complex&quot;, they are unnatural and constrained, somewhat stilted, flowery, have predilection for complicated foreign words, highs sounding quotations and other intellectual ornaments. They wish to compensate for painful feeling of stupidity by trying to impress others with their apparent education and intelligence.</p>\n\n<p>OTOH, the predicate-types give more significance to emotional side of stimulus words instead of intellectual side. But, those predicate-types which respond by exaggeration e.g.</p>\n\n<p>piano - horrible</p>\n\n<p>to sing - heavenly</p>\n\n<p>mother - ardently loved</p>\n\n<p>they actually are trying to conceal or overcompensate an emotional deficiency.</p>\n\n<p>Predicate-types can also betray themselves by external behavior as through. a particular affecation, enthusiasticc exclamations, an embellished behaviour, or constrained sounding language.</p>\n\n<p>After conducting Association session, Jung normally performed another session, Reproduction experiment to see how much of reactions to stimulus words are retained this time. For it is known that emotionally accentuated things are better retained in memory than indifferent things. This is quite true but it doesn&#39;t hold in linguistic expression of an emotionally accentuated content. So, normally neurotic/hysteric people differ a lot from their original respones.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>A 45yr old woman who is married to&nbsp;a drunkard lacks in emotions the love. in her marriage, so she seeks to obtain it in the outside world, and for that reason she is an ardent participant in the Christian Science movement. If the daughter imitates this situation, it is quite dangerous for her, she reacts to her environment as a sufferer soliciting sumpathy. Once freed from her&nbsp;father&nbsp; and mother she will be like her mother, i.e. she will be a suffering woman craving for inner gratification. She will thus be exposed to the great danger of falling a victim to brutality and of marrying a brute and inebriate like her father. This is not the good and pious precepts, nor is it any other inculcation of pedagogic truths that have a moulding influence upon the character of the developing child, but what most influences him is the peculiarly affective state which is totally unknown to his parents and educators. The concealed discord between the parents, the secret worry, the repressed hidden wishes, all these produce in the individual a certain affective state with its objective signs which slowly but surely, though unconsciously, works its way into the child&#39;s mind, producing therein the same conditions and hence the same reactions to external stimuli. We know the depressing effect mournful and melancholic persons have upon us. A restless and nervous individual infects his surroundings with unrest and dissatisfaction, a grumbler with his discontent, etc. The more sensitive and mouldable the child the deeper is the impression of parents. Thus things that are never even spoken about are reflected in the child.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Carl Jung&#39;s interesting cases:-</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>A woman who perceived dead children, went to graveyards to dig the bodies out thinking that there were children buried alive, The woman was well-educated.</li>\n\t<li>A woman who thought she talked to dead people (her grand-father and other relatives). She even came up with an esoteric diagram of how forces of nature work, which is normally seen in esoteric occult books, which by any means could not have been accessible to her.</li>\n\t<li>Neurotics who failed to respond to stimulus words.</li>\n\t<li>Hysterics who repeated same word in response to unrelated stimulus words. E.g. a short person who was also nicknamed &quot;Short&quot; and who used to walk on his toes in his room to look taller (it means he was deeply affected by his short stature) reapeated the word &quot;short&quot;&nbsp;many times.</li>\n\t<li>A 30yr old woman who suffered from episodic excitement in which she was violently jealous of here husbad. She was catholic, her husband was protestant. At the age of 27, she was supposed to have no idea how children were born. In the Association session, the strongest disturbances were found in words such as <em>to pray</em>, <em>to marry,</em> <em>happiness</em>, <em>false</em>, <em>fear</em>, and <em>contented</em>. The conclusions drawn from this is that she is not indifferent to the fact that her husbad is protestant, that she again thinks of praying, believs there is something wrong with marriage, that she is false, entertains fancies of faithlessness. The patient had a separation complex. <em>Her prudishness and jealousy were merely a projection of here own sexual wishes on her husband</em>. Later she admitted.</li>\n\t<li>And educated young woman of 26 suffered from a peculiar symptom. She thought her eyes now and then took on a strange expression which exerted a disagreeable influence on men. If she then looked at a man he became self-conscious, turned away and said something rapidly to his neighbour, at which both were either embarrassed or inclined to laugh. The patient was convinced that her look excited indecent thoughts in the men. It turned out that she had a lover who deserted here in a very marked manner. She was withdrawn and suicidal. In her seclusion theree accumulated unadmitted and repressed erotic wishes she unconsciously projected on men whenever she was in their company. This gave rise to the conviction that her look excited erotic wishes in men. Further investigation showed that her deserting lover was a lunatic, which she had not apparently observed. There was another lover before who was a lunatic too. Where did this unconscious tendency to choose insane persons come from? It turned out that her father was an eccentric character, and in his later years entirely estranged from his family. Her whole love had therefore been turned away from her father to a brother 8 yrs her senior. That brother became hopelessly insane at the age of 13. Her neurosis which gave the impression of insanity, probably originated from this infantile model.</li>\n\t<li>&nbsp;</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n","authorId":null,"subject":"hidden","tags":null,"img":null,"summary":"","lastUpdated":"2020-05-09T16:32:24.107+0000"}
