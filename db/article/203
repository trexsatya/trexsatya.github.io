Behavior is triggered by some part of the brain upon receipt of some inputs. The number of neurons, the health of the neurons and that part of the brain affect&nbsp;the behavior.</p>\n\n<p>The state of neurotransmitters, receptors, hormones at that time also affect the behavior. The activity of hormones themselves depends on hormonal development/activity a few days back in the body.</p>\n\n<p>The hormonal development also depends on the environment and <strong>perinatal</strong>, <strong>prenatal</strong> <strong>environment</strong> the person has been exposed to.</p>\n\n<p>The development and effect of transmitters, <strong>hormones</strong> also depends on the <strong>genes</strong>. The development and transfer of genes depend on environment and evolution.</p>\n\n<p>So, there are numerous dots to connect current behavior to evolutionary history.</p>\n\n<h2>Evolutionary Explanations of Behaviors:</h2>\n\n<p><strong>About Evolution</strong></p>\n\n<p>Darwin did not discover evolution.&nbsp;Darwin came up with the notion of a mechanism&nbsp;for evolution, natural selection.&nbsp;There was another guy, Alfred Russel Wallace who discovered it.</p>\n\n<p>First thing is that there is evolution -&nbsp;Traits in populations change over time.</p>\n\n<p>Traits can change enough that, in fact, you&nbsp;will get <strong>speciation</strong>.&nbsp;New species will form.&nbsp;And the logic of Darwinian evolution&nbsp;is built on just a few couples of very reasonable steps.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<ol>\n\t<li>First one is that there are traits that are heritable (child gets traits from parents).&nbsp;</li>\n\t<li>The next thing is that there is <strong>variability</strong> among those traits.&nbsp;There are different ways in which this trait can occur,&nbsp;and they&#39;re all heritable.</li>\n\t<li>Some versions of those traits are more <strong>adaptive</strong> than others.&nbsp;</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>All of this is not about survival of the most adapted.&nbsp;It&#39;s about reproduction. It&#39;s about the <strong>number of copies of genes you&nbsp;leave</strong> in the next generation.</p>\n\n<p>There are behaviors that are heritable, types, traits,&nbsp;classes of behaviors. They come with a certain degree of variation among individuals.&nbsp;Some versions of them are more adaptive than others.&nbsp;Over time, the more adaptive versions&nbsp;will become more commonplace.&nbsp;And every now and then, you can have mutations&nbsp;that introduce new variability.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Group Selection - <em>&quot;Animals behave for the good of their species&quot;</em> (<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Group_selection\" target=\"_blank\">Wynne-Edwards and group selection</a>), is a wrong concept, that has been thrashed out now.</p>\n\n<p>Animals behave for passing on as many copies of their genes, (and sometimes it can translate into co-operation). There are three building blocks for it:-</p>\n\n<ol>\n\t<li><strong>Individual selection</strong> (sometimes the behavior of an animal&nbsp;is meant to optimize the number of copies of its genes that it leaves in the next generation&nbsp;by itself reproducing. (<em>Sometimes a chicken is an egg&#39;s way of making another egg.</em>) Darwin&#39;s Sexual Selection process (that traits which are helpful in mating, which make one sex attracted to other also become common, sometimes even though it goes against Natural Selection. For example,&nbsp;You can get some species where the female fish&nbsp;prefer male fish that have very bright coloration.&nbsp;And that&#39;s sexually attractive and preferrable as per Sexual Selection, but the bright coloration makes you more likely to get predated by some other fish; then why maintain bright coloration?&nbsp;) this makes sense when seen in the realm of Individual Selection.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Kin selection</strong>: Sometimes, you will thus get behavior which really decreases&nbsp;the reproductive success of an individual&nbsp;in order to enhance the success of a relative. Because relatives carry your genes. Identical twins share 100% genes.&nbsp;(As Haldane said,&nbsp;I will gladly&nbsp;lay down my wife for two brothers or eight cousins.&nbsp;And that&#39;s the math of the relatedness.)&nbsp; The more the relatedness, the more the co-operation. (Evidence:&nbsp;Seyfarth and Cheney, University of Pennsylvania study on vervet monkeys)</li>\n\t<li><strong>Reciprocal Altruism</strong>: Sometimes organisms cut back on the competition&nbsp;(which can evolve into co-operation). They cut back on competition due to circumstances which are sort of Rock-Paper-Scissor equilibrium. A can harm B, B can harm C, C can harm A. So it&#39;s good for A that it does not harm B. If A eliminates B, B will not be there to eliminate C, which is a threat to A.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>About Cooperation</strong></p>\n\n<p><em>We are more active in spotting cheating than spotting spontaneous altruism.</em>&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_theory\" target=\"_blank\">Game Theory</a> is a problem space used to explore behaviors explaining <strong>when to cooperate and when to defect</strong>.</p>\n\n<p>Robert Axelrod using a computer model found that &quot;<strong>Tit-for-Tat</strong>&quot; is the optimal strategy.<br />\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;But in Tit For Tat, what if someone gets the wrong signal (mistakenly) that the other one cheated?<br />\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;To accommodate this, <em>Forgiving</em> Tit For Tat. Be willing to be forgiving in one round, if I have been seeing see-saw of cheating for some long time.<br />\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;But in this case, you could be exploited, if other players are not forgiving.<br />\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;So, start with Tit For Tat, (if there has been no cheating) then transition to Forgiving Tit For Tat. =&gt; Building trust.<br />\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;(but there is a chance of forgiving too readily and being taken advantage of)<br />\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Pavlov Strategy(nothing to do with Pavlovian psychology):&nbsp;if your opponent cooperated with you on the last round, repeat your last move; otherwise, switch.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Example of Cooperation in&nbsp;Vampire bats </strong>: The mothers suck the blood out of other animals, such as cows, and then bring the blood back for the kids. They are social animals and will feed others&#39; offspring as well. Research has been done in which mother vampire bats were captured and had their blood sacs filled with air so that it would appear to the other bats that they had a lot of good blood to share. When they returned to the nest and did not share, others took note and were then didn&#39;t help the research bat&#39;s offspring the next time they returned with blood food.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>Example of Cooperation in Naked Mole rats</strong> &nbsp;- These are the weirdest things out there. They are the closest things among the mammals to social insects, in terms of how their colonies work. They&#39;re totally bizarre, all of that. But they live in these big, cooperative colonies that are predominately underground in Africa. And they were discovered, I think, only in the 1970s or so. And for a while when zoologists got together, &nbsp;And you would see these big cooperative colonies, soon shown to not necessarily be of relatives. And reciprocity and all those sorts of rules. But people soon began to recognize there would be one or two animals in each colony that wasn&#39;t doing any work. Work digging out tunnels, bookkeeping, I don&#39;t know what naked mole rats do in terms of work. But there would be a few individuals who&nbsp;would just be sitting around. &nbsp;And they were these big old naked mole rats. &nbsp;They were much bigger than the other ones, and they were scarfing up food left and right. There goes Robert Axelrod down the drain. There goes all that optimization because no one would be punishing these guys. What&#39;s the deal? And it took enough watching these animals long enough to see this notion of oh, there&#39;s another game going on in which they play a more important role. And it is sort of dribbling across. When the rainy season comes, these big naked mole rats go up and turn around and they plug the entry to the tunnels then.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Studies have shown that brain centres responsible for <strong>pleasure</strong> light up <strong>during</strong> times of <strong>stabbing</strong> the other guy <strong>in the back</strong> and during times of <strong>cooperation</strong>. There is a pronounced gender difference as to when these areas are activated.</p>\n\n<p><strong>How does Cooperations start in non-relatives</strong>?</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Founder_effect\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"color:#8e44ad;\">Founder Effect</span></a>: how does co-operation start in a group of non-related animals?<br />\n&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;When a small part of the group is separated, because of kin-selection, a group becomes more co-operative and when that group coalesces with a larger non-cooperative group,&nbsp;it outperforms them. Hence they have to adapt to cooperation.<br />\n&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br />\nResources for studying more on this topic:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/134827.Darwin_s_Cathedral\" target=\"_blank\">Darwins Cathedral</a>&nbsp;-- how religions formed as a result of this.&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Evolution_of_Cooperation\">Wikipedia Article</a>,&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manufacturing_Consent\">Manufacturing Consent</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madman_theory\">Madman theory</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"http://wiki.c2.com/?TitForTatVsPavlov\">http://wiki.c2.com/?TitForTatVsPavlov</a></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>Tournament and Pair-Bonding Species:</strong></p>\n\n<p>You can tell a lot about the behavior of a species just by looking at their skull. Larger skull - tournament species, smaller skull - pair-bonding species. And there are many behaviors which are typical in these species.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>In TS the males have the bright plumage, the bid bodies, and the impressive fights over females. In pair-bonding species the size is more similar, the females have more options and the males are more paternal.&nbsp;<br />\nIn TS females choose for&nbsp;Good genes for offspring - big, strong. After all it&#39;s all she&#39;s getting. In PB females choose for&nbsp;Resources and parental skills.</p>\n\n<p>In PB twins are more possible because the female has help from the male.</p>\n\n<p>Abandonment in PB is more because the female knows that male will take care of the child.</p>\n\n<p><br />\nBaboons, chickens, some fish - tournament species.<br />\n<br />\nMarmosets, tamarins - pair bonding species.<br />\n<br />\nHumans are, of course, right in the middle, which helps explain a lot of male-female problems.

Langur monkeys, vervet monkeys, lions<br />\n&nbsp; &nbsp; Females have developed methods to dodge infanticides: Pseudo-estrus / Pseudo-ovulation.<br />\n<em>Kidnapping</em> (kid related to the attacker) to protect oneself. Savanna monkeys</p>\n\n<p><em>Band Of Brothers</em>/ Artificial Kinship: If males among the group get along much, aggression against other groups might follow. This behavior is exploited by the military also to form the band of brothers. However, it can have diverse effects also as seen in the Vietnam wars (rebel against hierarchy).&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Male or female kid choice:</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>Depends on cost.</li>\n\t<li>Robert Trivers: sex ratio fluctuation as a function of social context.</li>\n\t<li>Density-based selection; when one sex outnumbers other, switch over.<br />\n\t&nbsp;</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>Adelphic polyandry</strong>: two males (brothers) sharing bride .. in lions, in old Tibetan cultures<br />\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />\nImprinted Genes: genes manifesting different based on which parent they come from.</p>\n\n<p>Female flies are polyandrous, Male flies&#39; <strong>sperm</strong> has a <strong>toxin that can kill sperms from other guys</strong>. (study by David Haig)<br />\n&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br />\n<strong>Critiques to evolutionary theories</strong>:&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br />\n<br />\nIf animals are a growing number of traits, and supposing that these traits are heritable; do we see an increase in the number of genes passed down through generations.</p>\n\n<p>Adaptive fallacy: sometimes traits are not adapted; rather they are <strong><em>side-product</em></strong> of other selections. Evolution is not about optimizing every single trait.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Abiotic selection: selection for <strong><em>survival against ecology</em></strong>. has a small competitive context.</p>\n\n<p>Critique of Gradualism:&nbsp;Maybe evolution does not happen through gradual changes based on selections. Rather, nothing happens for a long time, and then there&#39;s a rapid change. (<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punctuated_equilibrium\" target=\"_blank\">Punctuated Equilibrium</a>). Role of competition is reduced in this model too.</p>\n\n<p>Another critic: a <em><strong>socio-political critique</strong></em>. Because this field has huge implications, politics might affect findings.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h2>Genetic Explanations of Behaviors:</h2>\n\n<p>Molecular Genetics:<br />\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Genes ⟶&nbsp;DNA sequences ⟶&nbsp;RNA sequences ⟶&nbsp;Amino Acid sequences ⟶&nbsp;Proteins</p>\n\n<p>21 amino acids react differently to water in the body and form different shapes. Shapes of proteins determine messenger-receptor union and determine functions.</p>\n\n<p>Then there are Enzymes, which act as a catalyst, can cut-paste of genes and form new genes.&nbsp;TFM <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Androgen_insensitivity_syndrome\" target=\"_blank\">Testicular Feminization Syndrome</a></p>\n\n<p>The critic of &nbsp;Punctuated Equilibrium: It was inferred by a palaeontologist and an evolutionary biologist, based on fossil records. Palaeontology can&#39;t tell about evolution, coz all they have access to is shape, fossil, not the internal organs like the brain. <em><strong>It has not been shown at the genetic level.</strong></em></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>How do we determine that some trait is genetic?</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>Same environment different genes (by studying twins)</li>\n\t<li>Same genes, different environment (by studying adopted twins)</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>The traits that run in families are genetic. No, apart from genes, the environment is also shared by families. This is not so easy.&nbsp;So we start off here that, just because you see something more in common in monozygotic twins&nbsp;than dizygotic, that doesn&#39;t tell you&nbsp;the first thing about whether it&#39;s genes involved.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong><span style=\"color:#8e44ad;\"><em>IQ distribution as a function of sex</em></span></strong>:&nbsp;Johns Hopkins Gifted Youth Program study (showing that Boys have more IQ in maths than girls, because of Biological factors). This is wrong on so many levels:&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>An endless number of studies have shown, beginning&nbsp;by first grade, if it is a simple math&nbsp;problem at that stage for the same hands put up,&nbsp;a boy is more likely to be called on than a girl. Studies showing that, for the same correct answer,&nbsp;boys in elementary schools are more likely to be praised for the correct answer than are girls.&nbsp;&nbsp;By the time junior high school is coming around,&nbsp;guidance counsellors are already differentially,&nbsp;by sex, advising, once you get into high school,&nbsp;to take more elective math.</p>\n\n<p>One finding that is that <strong><span style=\"color:#8e44ad;\"><em>far more females are interested in peace than males,&nbsp;males are more interested in justice</em></span></strong>.</p>\n\n<h2>Explanation for Sexual Behaviors:</h2>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#8e44ad;\">Why such rush at the end of sex?</span>&nbsp;<br />\n&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Distal explanation -&nbsp;Passing on copies of your genes, the effects&nbsp;of hormones, and certain reward pathways&nbsp;in the brain, all of that.<br />\n&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Proximal explanation - It feels good.</p>\n\n<p>The loop of sensory stimuli, feedback, and immediate sensations carry out the behavior.</p>\n\n<p>Attractivity (how attractive an individual is to someone else),&nbsp;Receptivity ( how receptive that individual&nbsp;is to the interest of the other individual),&nbsp;Proceptivity (the active behaviors&nbsp;that are carried out in response to being attracted to, Fixed Action Patterns).</p>\n\n<p><strong><span style=\"color:#8e44ad;\">Female Orgasm</span></strong>:</p>\n\n<p>Are we only species to experience orgasm? - No.</p>\n\n<p>Is Orgasm necessary or helpful in reproduction? - Not necessarily.</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>But a theory is that it increases sperm motility, hence helpful.&nbsp;Evidence for that has always been a little bit indirect.&nbsp;And the notion here is that what orgasm does is,&nbsp;among other things, exhausts you enormously,&nbsp;causing you to be far more likely to be&nbsp;horizontal than vertical shortly thereafter, and thus, facilitating fertilization because the sperm doesn&#39;t&nbsp;have to swim straight up against gravity.&nbsp;</li>\n\t<li><em>Reinforcement theory:</em>&nbsp;it feels good and thus you are more likely to do it&nbsp;again and increasing the likelihood of passing on copies of your genes.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>However, these are not big enough effects to actually make a difference in terms of reproductive success.</p>\n\n<p>Why clitoral orgasm then? &mdash; Maybe orgasm is just <em>spandrel</em>. Not beneficial, but the baggage of evolution. Just as nipples are spandrels in men.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Why male orgasm?</strong> &nbsp;&mdash; Maybe because during orgasm ejaculation is more voluminous.</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#8e44ad;\">Is non-reproductive sex unique to humans?</span> No - but certainly it&#39;s a speciality in humans.</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#8e44ad;\">Is foreplay unique to humans?</span> - No. Chimps do that.</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#8e44ad;\">Is homosexuality unique in humans?</span> - No. And it&#39;s also seen not only among captive animals, but also among animals living in natural settings.</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#8e44ad;\">What&#39;s unique to human sexual behavior?</span> - That we like to do it in private.</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#8e44ad;\">Is fantasizing unique to humans?</span> - We don&#39;t know completely. But not likely. Some species of monkeys have been seen masturbating on the showing of a picture desirable female.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><em><strong>Marriage, the concept of monogamy&nbsp;(whatever level, in most cases, people are socially monogamous not sexually), romance seem unique to humans.&nbsp;</strong></em></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>Some weird sexual behaviors/activities:</strong>&nbsp;hermaphroditic animals (having partial sexual organs), changing sexes occasionally in fishes,&nbsp;parthenogenetic (females producing without input from males), in some snakes,&nbsp;females producing without input from a male but not until it has mated with some male in its lifetime.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong><span style=\"color:#8e44ad;\">What part of the brain is responsible for sexual activities?</span> </strong></p>\n\n<p>Limbic System (not entirely but majorly).&nbsp;ventral medial hypothalamus, estrogen and progesterone receptors in the hypothalamus, midbrain involved&nbsp;in female sexual behavior.&nbsp;the medial preoptic area,&nbsp;testosterone receptors, androgen receptors, within the medial preoptic area. in males.&nbsp; Amygdala&nbsp;involved in sexual motivation along with many other things like fear, anxiety, aggression. The Medial preoptic area is much more about sexual performance in males. It is the parasympathetic nervous system&nbsp;that establishes the erection of the penis or clitoris. The process of arousal involves the transition to sympathetic.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>How long it takes&nbsp;for the sympathetic nervous system&nbsp;to go back to baseline post orgasm - A lot less in females than in males. <strong>That&#39;s why females expect more time that men should spend after sex with them</strong>.&nbsp;<br />\n<br />\nThe common problems in males is&nbsp;too rapid of a transition&nbsp;from parasympathetic to sympathetic.&nbsp;In other words, the world of <em>premature ejaculation</em>. In females, failure of the transition from parasympathetic to sympathetic, <em>inability to reach orgasm</em>. Dopamine plays a huge role in sexual behavior and is identical in both sexes.&nbsp;Deplete that pathway of dopamine,&nbsp;and you&#39;re not going to get a whole lot of interest&nbsp;in sexual behavior.&nbsp;<strong>Clinical depression thus affects libido</strong>.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong><span style=\"color:#8e44ad;\">Study</span></strong>: People in brain scanners, show them pictures of a female. If they find female attractive and the female in the picture is looking away, dopamine region in the brain not activated, but if the female is looking direct like forming an eye contact, the dopamine region is activated. If the person finds female unattractive, dopamine region activates if the female is looking away rather than looking directly. Switch the genders and it works the same way.</p>\n\n<p><strong><span style=\"color:#8e44ad;\">Dopamine activates in anticipation of the reward, rather than getting the reward itself.</span></strong>&nbsp;people will work like mad in contexts of maybe far more so than when they work in contexts of certainty.&nbsp;This is <em>intermittent reinforcement</em>.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;<em>A relationship is the price you pay for the anticipation of it.</em>&quot; - a&nbsp;grim worldview, but might have more truth in it.</p>\n\n<p>A <span style=\"color:#8e44ad;\">study</span> was done on people divided into two groups with relationship&nbsp;2-3 weeks old, and with relationship 5 years old. When the picture of their beloved one was shown (flashed&nbsp;for a second among a stream of many pictures), dopamine level jumped high like crazy in people with a short-term relationship and didn&#39;t activate in people with a long-term relationship. What activated in long-term relationship people is&nbsp;anterior cingulate&nbsp;cortex that&#39;s responsible for empathy and comfort among many other things.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Frontal Cortex in the brain reigns sexual behavior, guiding when and in which context it&#39;s appropriate to have sexual behavior. People with damaged Frontal Cortex do all sort of inappropriate sexual activities.</p>\n\n<p>Female humans, <span style=\"color:#8e44ad;\">when having sex</span>, secrete lots of oxytocin. Oxytocin plays an important role in <span style=\"color:#8e44ad;\">forming </span><span style=\"color:#8e44ad;\">attachment</span>. Along with dopamine and D2 receptors, it is very critical for pair-bonding.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>Neuromarketing industry</strong>&nbsp;is based on&nbsp;making use of oxytocin (aerosolized form) to make people more trusting, cooperative.</p>\n\n<p>Male humans, when having sex, testosterone level goes up. As contrary to popular belief, a higher level of testosterone does not increase sexual behavior, it is the other way round.&nbsp;Oxytocin is to females as vasopressin is to males.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#8e44ad;\">Is there anything different in brains of homosexuals?</span></p>\n\n<p>Yes.&nbsp;Simon LeVay Study, Size of&nbsp;a hypothalamic nucleus in gay men is equal to the size of that in a heterosexual woman which is double of that in a heterosexual man. However, a little caveat in the study was the brains he used for the study (of people died of AIDS). Gay men tend to have the <strong>finger length&nbsp;ratio</strong> of straight women rather than of straight men. Gay men having the <strong>autoacoustic</strong>&nbsp;(the sound/vibrations that&#39;s heard when you put fingers on your ears) reflexive&nbsp;vibratory speed more typical of straight women&nbsp;than straight men. Sexual orientation in women is far less studied.</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#8e44ad;\">Is there anything different in brains of transsexuals?</span></p>\n\n<p>Yes - a part of the brain near hypothalamus is actually the size of a typical size of the sex they insist on rather than the sex their body is. This is shown in post-mortem brains of both who got sex-change and those who didn&#39;t but insisted on that they had got the wrong body. So this has not to do with hormones much.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Evolutionary Theories for Homosexuality:</strong></p>\n\n<p>How come evolution did not select against homosexuality? There are 3 theories, and we have little evidence in support of them.</p>\n\n<p>That&#39;s the deal where you can have certain traits which can be in the homozygotic form or in the heterozygotic form. And what you see is, with lots of diseases you get an extreme version is indeed a disease and a partial version is, in fact, adaptive. And the classic example that always gets trotted out is sickle-cell anemia-- full-blown homozygotic version, horrible hematological disorder; partial, heterozygotic version, resistance to malaria and a gazillion diseases out there. And what&#39;s done is metaphorically running the same argument of saying, whatever gene genes are relevant, maybe the homozygotic form is the one that produces a behavioral phenotype which decreases reproductive success. But there&#39;s some heterozygotic form which has some huge advantage and enough of one to outweigh the one-fourth of the relatives who wind up with the homozygotic version. &nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Next model&nbsp;is a gender-dependent genetic argument, as follows. It is a trait. It is a genetically influenced trait which, when expressed in one gender, is maladaptive and decreases reproductive success. But when it is expressed in the other gender, it is highly adaptive and increases reproductive success. as long as the benefits for the other kind of sibling or gender is larger than the detriment here, this is going to be selected for. What would that look like? What one would predict is that you would see, for gay men, that their sisters have a higher-than-average reproductive rate. And that is absolutely there in the literature. &nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>The third model is the &quot;helper at the nest&quot; model, which is that the individual who traditionally is not passing on copies of their own genes directly-- instead, what they&#39;re doing is expending resources on helping their siblings. OK, so that kind of sounds like the second model, also. What&#39;s the difference? The second model says that sisters of gay men should have increased reproductive rates. What the third model-- the &quot;helping at the nest&quot; model-- suggests is, both sisters and brothers should have increased reproductive rates. And that&#39;s actually what&#39;s mostly been seen. So, support for this &quot;helper at the nest&quot; kin-selection kind of argument. &nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>Sexual Attractiveness:</strong></p>\n\n<p>Men get more dopamine activation and arousal from visual than women. At ovulation, women&#39;s skin&nbsp;is more sensitive to sexually arousing touch.&nbsp;Men who are castrated, tactile responsiveness to stimuli&nbsp;goes down (along with testosterone) in terms of finding them pleasurable,&nbsp;sexually arousing.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>What you see is that males do not generate sexually arousing&nbsp;pheromones if they lack testosterone levels.&nbsp;Ovariectomized females, women, rats, monkeys,&nbsp;et cetera, who have had their ovaries removed&nbsp;do not produce pheromones that&nbsp;is sexually arousing.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#8e44ad;\"><strong>Pheromones</strong></span> carry a lot of information like health status, sex differentiation, etc. Gay men are better at detecting the smell of gay men compared to straight men or straight women.</p>\n\n<p>One initial characteristic, which is the famed role of <span style=\"color:#8e44ad;\"><strong>facial symmetry</strong></span> in attractiveness. This has an interesting history, and this goes back to the 19th century. &nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>... (A study where people made a composite of pictures taken of a lot of criminals&#39; faces) Which is that, when you average in a whole lot of faces, one of the things you average is the averageness of the face. And you get rid of asymmetries. And everyone knows that-- who would you want to mate with? &nbsp;Wildly asymmetric faces are typically the result of complications-- developmental ones-- health sort of issues. So the general interpretation is that symmetry is attractive because it is a marker of health.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>A study found people with symmetric faces are better dancers. Well, that if true could result from an indirect route - people with symmetric faces are viewed more beautiful, they would be treated better, they would become more confident in what they are doing, ....</p>\n\n<p>Secondary appearances,&nbsp;secondary sexual ones, can be a marker for health&nbsp;and/or fertility.</p>\n\n<p>It is a display of how much energy you can afford to waste and thus how much you must have on board. It is a marker of health and good immunity. This has been shown in lots of studies.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>A well-functioning immune system will be generating some molecule which exaggerates facial coloration.</p>\n\n<p>And that&#39;s the secondary sexual characteristic-- that there is an explicit link between immune function, immune competence, and these markers. Interesting. &nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>A recent study...And what was shown was that, in general, <span style=\"color:#8e44ad;\"><strong>women have a preference for faces of men that have strong pronounced secondary characteristics-- which is, big, jutting jaw, high forehead, lots of muscle stuff going on</strong></span>. And what they showed was that the longer the life expectancy in the particular country, the better the economy, <span style=\"color:#8e44ad;\"><strong>the better the quality of life, the </strong></span><span style=\"color:#8e44ad;\"><strong>fewer</strong></span><span style=\"color:#8e44ad;\"><strong> women in that country had a bias towards male-looking males</strong></span>. Which is extremely interesting. What&#39;s the comparison there? It was all those, like, Scandinavian countries. And a lot of what this whole handicap principle is about, a lot of this advertising about what a great immune system you have, is a way of advertising, I do not have a communicable disease.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>All sorts of species-- individuals are extremely good at detecting the smells in the others of parasitic infections, of all sorts of other infections, and avoiding them like the plague. So, of course, what you start getting are <span style=\"color:#8e44ad;\"><strong>individuals trying to cheat at all of this</strong></span>. And this is suddenly the world of selection to uncouple your secondary sexual characteristics from your health. Is there a way to cheat? And what is seen in some bird species is, you&#39;ve got some guy on his deathbed, there. And what&#39;s he doing with his last 3 and 1/2 calories worth of energy? He&#39;s expending it on wing coloration or whatever the secondary characteristic thing is, there, that he&#39;s got four minutes of life left, and maybe there&#39;s one more chance to pass on copies of his genes. You get cases of disproportionate shunting of caloric investment towards some of these markers amid animals being sick. So, of course, you have to have counterstrategies. And we have yet another world of coevolution between some sort of exploitative strategy and a counter one to try to detect that. &nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Meanwhile, you can have exactly the opposite case, which is, you can have your secondary sexual characteristic driven by an infection that you have. And what you are presumably communicating is, if I&#39;m still able to do this ridiculous courtship dance, despite the fact that I&#39;m teeming with parasites, I&#39;ve got the greatest DNA going around, there. Hey, how about it? Where you see this is in vultures. &nbsp;It remains very, very controversial-- for the three and a half people who deeply care about this.</p>\n\n<p>The &quot;<span style=\"color:#8e44ad;\"><strong>there&#39;s no free lunch</strong></span>, ... a highly dramatic set of secondary sexual characteristics in lions. The manes. &nbsp;And what everybody knows from The Lion King is that they can be very big and dramatic-looking What is the most attractive sort of male lion you can see? It&#39;s a black-maned male. Because that is one that is most expensive, in this handicap-principle sense. But there&#39;s a downside if you&#39;ve got a black mane, which is, your head heats up more, sitting there in the African sun. You&#39;ve got to spend more energy on thermal regulation. There&#39;s a downside to it. All of these things, where you&#39;re balancing.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>What else? What else, in terms of attractiveness? &nbsp;In baboons, estrus amount of swelling indicates the amount of fertility and health. &nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>But what you have with <strong>humans</strong> is the famed <strong>waist-hip ratio measure</strong>. And this one has been endlessly studied and argued about. The notion that the lesser the size of the hips, relative to the size of the waist, the greater the waist-hip ratio -- &nbsp;That is a marker of childbearing pelvises. That is a marker of all sorts of developmental health that augurs well for having a baby pass through the birth canal. In culture after culture, men find women to be more attractive who have a higher-skewed ratio of hip to waist. So that&#39;s been studied all over the place. But this may be a result of contamination from western civilization. When you look at more traditional societies, you do not necessarily see as strong of a hip-waist-ratio set of opinions. &nbsp;<span style=\"color:#8e44ad;\"><strong>But nonetheless, at least some of that is universal in every culture that&#39;s been looked at. &nbsp;</strong></span></p>\n\n<p>Studies showing that when you give women a choice of faces of males that have been manipulated, changing the dramatic-- how dramatic the secondary characteristics are-- like forehead and jutting-jawedness and angularity of face and stuff-- what you see is an interesting dichotomy. Which is, in these studies, <span style=\"color:#8e44ad;\"><strong>women on the average rate the rounder-faced pictures of men, such men, looking more </strong></span><span style=\"color:#8e44ad;\"><strong>likeable</strong></span><span style=\"color:#8e44ad;\"><strong>, more honest, more trustworthy, and </strong></span><strong>less desirable</strong>. And, again, when you look at these studies, the differences are, like, 5% difference in nostril width and things, when they&#39;re manipulated -- these are extraordinarily subtle differences, where people are not consciously aware of them. &nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>When women are ovulating, they prefer more sexually secondary, secondary-sexually characteristically dramatic male faces. At the time of ovulation, women rate as more attractive male faces with the juttier jaws and the greater muscle mass and the forehead stuff going on. at the time that estrogen levels are at their highest in humans and lots of realms, in addition to other species, detection of pheromones from males is the most sensitive.</p>\n\n<p>Ability to pick up subtle differences in facial symmetry or secondary sexual characteristics are at their best (during ovulation). And the preferences are derived from that. &nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Mate various birds in various bird species-- mate females with males who are more attractive versus mating them with less attractive, and what you see is that the females who have mated with the more attractive males give birth to bigger eggs. That&#39;s interesting. OK, so you&#39;re seeing the evidence of the good genes coming from the guy. Male genes have nothing to do with egg size. It is how much protein the mother puts into the egg production and egg development. ..<strong><span style=\"color:#8e44ad;\">So mothers care more if the kid is from a healthier guy</span></strong>... &nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Lee Dugatkin at the University of Kentucky study on osprey: Females select the previously rejected guy when that guy is made to appear to be more popular among females. And thus this <span style=\"color:#8e44ad;\"><strong>bandwagon effect</strong></span>. &nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>By the time you get to pair-bonding species, the rituals and what is attractive are often markers not of fertility but of parenting skill-- parenting. Females, the first-time-out rounds of ovulating, are less preferred than females who have had a number of kids already. If it is the same thing going on, what she has already proven is she&#39;s competent enough that she didn&#39;t kill the kids by dropping them out of the tree at various points. This being as a marker, again, of competence. &nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>...in every human culture, is being attracted to someone who&#39;s kind of just like you are. <span style=\"color:#8e44ad;\"><strong>Being attracted to someone who is similar</strong></span>. And the term for this is &quot;homogamy.&quot; In this case, homogamy-- mating with someone who is homogeneous, who is similar in traits of yours. And across cultures, including in the United States, people are extremely homogamous in who they wind up marrying. Here are the statistics. When you look at couples in this country, there is better than a 90%-chance likelihood of them sharing the same religion, of being within three years of age of each other, of sharing the same race-- the ethnicity-- sharing the socioeconomic status of their childhood-- did they both grow up poor, wealthy, whatever-- and sharing political views. Stepping down a bit-- not in this range-- but more than 40% homogamy for a couple having IQs that are within, A 20% to 40% likelihood of couples being the same height-- not the same height, but say, for example, in the top 10 percentile of height for their sex-- scaled to what&#39;s within gender. Weight, hair color. And then you get into this bizarre world of lung capacity, of the width of nostrils, of the width of eyes. People have studied these, and these are traits that show significant homogamy. What are these weird things being about? These are probably surrogate markers for preferring people of similar race, similar ethnicity. That&#39;s probably where those numbers are coming from.</p>\n\n<p>You don&#39;t want to mate with someone who shares half their genes with you-- the dangers of inbreeding. But you also don&#39;t necessarily want to mate with someone who is so unrelated that there is no drive of kin selection for cooperation.</p>\n\n<p>We have now heard, from bird species to humans, you get the optimal fertility somewhere around third to fourth cousins. You get the optimal fertility, under circumstances that select for a fair degree of homogamy across different cultures. This has been shown in different sort of environments, in diverse cultures, traditional cultures, Iceland where they have centuries clean record of who married whom, and an optimal number of children who survived into adulthood, you get from third- to fourth-cousin marriages.&nbsp; A recent study in US adds one more factor, <span style=\"color:#8e44ad;\">younger people care less about homogamy, maybe because with age people become </span><span style=\"color:#8e44ad;\">close-minded</span><span style=\"color:#8e44ad;\"> which is a fact on average</span>. &nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>David Buss (University of Texas) study: In every culture looked at, women (more than men) are more likely than men to want a mate who is older than them. Men (more than women) look for younger. Women (more than men) prefer economic prowess of the individual. Men (more than women) prefer for markers of health, fertility. <span style=\"color:#8e44ad;\"><strong>But in every&nbsp;one of them, both would want to end up with someone who is nice to them.</strong></span> &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h2>Aggression and Violence: &nbsp;&nbsp;</h2>\n\n<p>Aggression is in-built in creatures, we learn socially and environmentally not how to be aggressive, but when to be aggressive..&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#8e44ad;\">Do only humans perform aggression for fun?</span>&nbsp; - No. Langur monkeys kill babies of other monkeys.. Competitive infanticide.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>We are not the only species, that makes weapons - Chimps for example also do that making branches, smoothing it out and using a weapon.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>We are also not the only species that performs <span style=\"color:#8e44ad;\">organized violence</span>. - Jane Goodall study, chimps perform border patrols. An example of Genocide, they have been seen to kill members of other groups. &nbsp;Lots of people still argue that humans are the only species that psychopathologically confuse sexual behavior with aggressive behavior-- world of sadism and masochism and all of that. &nbsp;Killing males, children of other groups and then hang out with their females has also been documented in chimps. &nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Reconciliation aftermath of aggression is also seen in other species too. Frans de Waal first reporting this in rhesus monkeys, I believe. also in dolphins, whales &nbsp;In gorillas, baboons (only female not male), bonobos show Reconciliation. The way of reconciliation in bonobos is sex. Because with the bonobos, anything that happens, and it&#39;s time to have sex. &nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>Empathy in other species:&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n<p>Frans de Waal chimp study: Chimps who were getting pummelled as innocent bystanders, by high ranking guys, were far more likely to be groomed by females there in the group than the guys who start a fight with high-ranking guys. &nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Researchers from McGill rat study suggests something similar. &nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>But we are only species which gets moved by images, listening to catastrophe happened with people from other side of the planet, animations. &nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>We are ostensibly the only species with a sense of justice. Frans de Waal study on chimps shows that it could not be the case. &nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>But definitely, humans are unique in creativity when it comes to violence and aggression. Showing faces, damning someone, pulling a&nbsp;trigger, dropping bombs,..... Passive-aggression &nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>Subtleties of Empathy in humans.&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n<p>We are a species who has invented truth-and-reconciliation commissions in South Africa, in the Balkans, in Rwanda, where people face the person who did that to them, the person who destroyed their life, destroyed their family. And it works sometimes.</p>\n\n<p>I will let no man spoil my soul by causing me to hate him. That is a psychology that is unprecedented.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>We have the world of people like this Catholic nun, Sister Helen Prejean, who has spent her entire career ministering to the needs of men on death row in a maximum-security prison in Louisiana. She was the person who was featured in the movie way back when Dead Man Walking. And what she spent a lot of her time doing is having incredulous people, often the relatives of the victims of these murderers, come up and say, how can you do this? How could you spend your life devoted to people like these? And she comes up with an answer that is so definedly human, that no other species could come near. No matter how much they groom victims, her answer always is, the less forgivable the act, the more it must be forgiven. The less lovable the person, the more they must be loved. &nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>The Brain Anatomy involved in Aggression:</strong></p>\n\n<p>When you destroy the limbic system, you get completely inappropriate sexual behavior in primates. also, you get completely inappropriate aggressive behavior.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>The amygdala and its role in fear, its role in anxiety-- that strange role, in males, of sexual motivation. But what the amygdala is most renowned for is its role in aggression. And, as I emphasized last week, it is mighty interesting, I think, that the part of the brain which is most responsive to when you are scared is the part of the brain that generates the starts of aggressive behavior. &nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Psychosurgical cases: three neurosurgeons at Harvard wrote a letter to the New York Times, pointing out there&#39;s this great surgical technique which they were the pioneers of where you could take aggressive humans and make them less aggressive with no other side effects. court-enforced amygdalectomies. And it was tried on many people (by order of court), and it indeed made them less aggressive, but there was no much of a person left afterwards. &nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>.... So, uncontrolled stimulation in the amygdala, and you get some aggression there. &nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Charles Whitman, a mass murderer, was found to have tumor in amygdala, in Post-mortem. &nbsp;Germany called the Baader-Meinhof gang.one of the two found, on postmortem, to have a tumor in her amygdala. &nbsp;<br />\nInterestingly, the amygdala gets bigger, as we&#39;ve heard, in people with posttraumatic stress disorder. And what you see there is also increased frequency of violent behavior. people with amygdaloid lesions, they are very bad at detecting faces expressing angry emotions. They are more trusting of people than average individuals are. They are more likely to forgive.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Antonio Damasio study - &nbsp;The amygdala not only responds to aggression and fear-provoking stimuli.
