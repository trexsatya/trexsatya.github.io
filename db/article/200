{"name": "Buddhist Psychology", "id": 200, "content": "<p>Source: <a href=\"http://Understanding Our Mind: 50 Verses on Buddhist Psychology\">Understanding Our Mind: 50 Verses on Buddhist Psychology </a></p>\n\n<p>This book categorizes the consciousness into 8 types - Store Consciousness, 5 Sense Consciousnesses, Manas, Mind Consciousness (with an emphasis that this categorization is only for understanding, these are actually just eight <strong><em>functions</em></strong> of consciousness, it must be thrown away later), but I find this confusing (especially after having read different types of literature). So, I will just lay down the observations, and main points that this book makes, followed by an incomplete summary of the book.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<ol>\n\t<li>With birth, we gain some &quot;seeds&quot;. These seeds work all the way up to whatever behavior (and even reality such as <em>body, mind, objects</em>) is manifested within our consciousness.</li>\n\t<li>New seeds are sown during the lifetime (and even within the womb) with each of actions (mind actions, bodily actions including speech).</li>\n\t<li>So, there&#39;s kind of a feedback loop between manifestation and the stored seeds.<br />\n\t(Buddhism probably assigns one seed for one image that we see, one-to-one mapping. From a modern scientific view, this is not what happens. But, still, the idea of this sort of feedback loop is relevant, where &quot;seed&quot; is some sort of abstract element)</li>\n\t<li>The seeds&#39; effect is not independent, it depends on conditions. Time is one of those conditions.</li>\n\t<li>When we see a house, do we really see &quot;house&quot; or do we see &quot;a house&quot;? Both are present, we generally focus on one, (and even use the term interchangeably). &quot;House&quot; as a concept <strong>(universal)</strong>, and the <em>perceived</em> <strong>particular</strong> house, as a real entity. This happens in all cases.</li>\n\t<li>A similar thing happens when we see the &quot;whole&quot; and &quot;parts&quot;. When we see a car, we see all the parts as one <strong>(unity)</strong>, and with attention, we also see the parts of which it is made of <strong><em>(diversity)</em></strong>. Again, both are present, but our attention is, generally, on only one.</li>\n\t<li>When a house is being created, the parts of the house, have already started <em>disintegrating</em> (very slowly). Again, both <strong>formation</strong>&nbsp;and <strong>disintegration</strong> are present at the same time, but we, generally, attend to only one. This can be generalized to &quot;Life&quot; and &quot;Death&quot;.</li>\n\t<li>What we see is not really what is present, what we see is a mental image (as a result of the operation of all aspects of consciousness). This applies to objects as well as&nbsp;people, even the people we think we love.</li>\n\t<li>Perception is not independent, real, and free from everything else. It is affected by the &quot;seeds&quot;, the status/activity of different consciousnesses.</li>\n\t<li>We say that something exists because we have observed it, but we forget that manifestation is not necessary for existence because manifestation is dependent upon our faculties. <span style=\"color:#2980b9;\"><em>[Maybe our use of the word &quot;exist&quot; is superfluous] [This is a very slippery line of thinking, people say that &quot;just because we do not have a way to observe things like soul, doesn&#39;t mean that soul does not exist&quot;.]</em></span></li>\n\t<li>We can be in 3 realms: the realm of desire, the realm of form, the realm of non-form. <span style=\"color:#f39c12;\"><em>[This is not explicitly written in this book, but it seems that even the acts that we perform for survival falls in the realm of desire, in the realm of form we observe but do not assign any conceptual status to any observation, the realm of non-form is probably completely mental]. [Whether the two of the latter realms are really possible or not is the question, and an interesting thing is that nobody has ever demonstrated these realms.]</em></span></li>\n\t<li>We have this idea of &quot;objectivity&quot;, but we forget that this objectivity also comes from individual consciousness. <span style=\"color:#8e44ad;\"><em>[And the experiences that we have are not even 100% exact about anything e.g. the perception of color]</em></span>. The objective reality is a result of collective consciousness.</li>\n\t<li>The individual consciousnesses and collective consciousness interplay to bring forth novel ideas. Even the ideas as simple as color, form, beauty etc. You don&#39;t have any freedom regarding the concepts that you have, and as a result about anything.</li>\n\t<li>No seed in our individual consciousness is 100% innate, or 100% transmitted (biologically, or socially, or by any means).</li>\n\t<li>Violence, non-violence, wholesome, unwholesome all kinds of seeds are present and formed continuously within our consciousness.</li>\n\t<li>So, it&#39;s better to apply specific solutions to peoples&#39; problems by trying to see what their stored consciousness has, i.e. what kind of seeds they have deep-rooted, rather than giving a general solution. This basically means understanding the person before advising/treating.</li>\n\t<li>So, the Buddha&#39;s Eightfold path suggests us to prevent the manifestation of unwholesome seeds, try to send them back to store if arisen in mind, try to water the wholesome seeds, and maintain them as long as possible when arisen in mind.</li>\n\t<li>Wholesome/positive seeds need more watering, more conditions than the unwholesome/negative ones. <span style=\"color:#f39c12;\"><em>[I have a personal theory that evil doesn&#39;t have to make much effort, it&#39;s all-pervading, the good has to do a lot just in order to exist, just like&nbsp;darkness and light, darkness is all-pervasive, and light has to struggle just for existence.]</em></span></li>\n\t<li>What we perceive can be&nbsp;<em>thing-in-itself</em>, a <em>representation</em>, or a mere <em>image</em>. What is the difference between representation and mere image? When we perceive just by senses, no mental assignment has taken place, that is the mode of suchness, in that mode we see things-in-themselves. <span style=\"color:#8e44ad;\"><em>[Buddhism doesn&#39;t doubt it, but I do, we can never see things in themselves, but yeah it is possible to see things without assigning any mental status to them]</em>. When mentality is involved with what we perceive by senses, we see representation. In dreams, we see mere images.&nbsp;</span><em><span style=\"color:#8e44ad;\">[It seems impossible, but meditation&#39;s ultimate goal is to make it possible to see things in themselves.]<br />\n\t[One more goal of Buddhist meditation is achieving the state of non-perception, which is theoretically possible as there are species on our planet which are alive without perception]</span></em></li>\n\t<li><span style=\"color:#f39c12;\"><em>[Our mind/consciousness has not only the ways of storing what we have seen, but it also has tools to operate on the representations, images. It has tools to form the relationship between the images, it has tools to link images temporally. It has tools to extrapolate. These tools make imagination possible]</em></span></li>\n\t<li>We don&#39;t love or hate the actual things/people. We love/hate the images formed within the mind. <em>[This is extended to every perception, feeling]</em></li>\n\t<li><span style=\"color:#8e44ad;\"><em>[In general mode, our mind is not interested in reality, it acts based on habits, instincts (the survival instinct is probably the strongest among them). It sees the things and matches with the images that it has, the mental tools after doing the matching, puts the thing into some category (forming a new one if necessary), assigns/links some properties, assigns/links some value, assigs some feeling, etc]</em></span></li>\n\t<li>Intuition is a form of knowing that is not based in thinking and imagining. <em>[What is it based in, then?]</em></li>\n\t<li>False perceptions apply to our idea of happiness as well. It is not uncommon to see that what we think&nbsp;will give us happiness, doesn&#39;t actually give us happiness. Moreover, we fail to notice again and again that whatever gives us happiness, does not continue to do so. <span style=\"color:#f39c12;\"><em>[That&#39;s why Buddhism focuses on the principle of impermanence, we never explicitly think that anything is permanent, but we act as if it were. We spend a lot of time for a momentary&nbsp;gain of &quot;happiness&quot;.&nbsp;What is it that makes those moments happy? If it is really about the things, then why don&#39;t those things continue to make us happy for as long as they exist? Well, on deeper analysis, we see that the things themselves do not always remain the same, then their image in our mind does not remain the same, then our mind does not remain the same, then the interaction among mind, image, and the thing does not remain the same, then our expectations do not remain the same. Overall, it seems to be more about the mind &mdash;&nbsp;with all the relationships it has to things and ideas &mdash;&nbsp;than the things themselves.]</em></span><br />\n\t<span style=\"color:#8e44ad;\"><em>[It seems that this line of thinking will lead to minimalism, but then why even stop at minimalism? Why not go for nothing&nbsp;at all? Buddhism actually aims for no existence at all (at least physical existence), that&#39;s what Nirvana is about. And this idea is strengthened by consideration of birth-rebirth. It is unclear whether Buddhism sees birth-rebirth in a particular sense of animal-level birth-rebirth or at the level of fundamental substance/matter. Or, maybe none of them, it sees consciousness as fundamental, and matter, life as manifestation, so what it really aims for is &mdash; the consciousness which does not manifest in any form]</em></span><br />\n\t<span style=\"color:#f39c12;\"><em>[What is &quot;happiness&quot; though? - One (good) definition is &#39;that which we would like to continue&#39;. Although, generally, we identify it with the things, events, which we know will not continue.]</em></span></li>\n\t<li>Universal mental formations - those associated with different/all kinds of consciousness - are&nbsp;Contact (Sparsha),&nbsp;Attention (Manaskara),&nbsp;Feeling (Vedana),&nbsp;Perception or Conceptualization or Cognition (Samjna),&nbsp;Volition/Intention (Chetana). This &quot;Feeling&quot; is not in the sense that we normally talk about feelings, it&#39;s about the sensation that arises as a result of contact of sense and sense object.&nbsp;All these mental formations are associated/engaged with each other as well.<br />\n\t<em><span style=\"color:#8e44ad;\">[What is manasikara? It is a continuity having the function of holding the mind to what has become its reference.</span><sup id=\"cite_ref-g1_1-1\"><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manasik%C4%81ra#cite_note-g1-1\"><span style=\"color:#8e44ad;\">[1]</span></a></sup><span style=\"color:#8e44ad;\">]</span><br />\n\t<span style=\"color:#f39c12;\">[The labeling of pleasant, painful, neutral (/wholesome, unwholesome, indeterminate) is done after the Vedana is produced.]</span><br />\n\t<span style=\"color:#2980b9;\">[Samjna is mostly about grasping distinguishing/discriminating feature, which makes it possible to form a representation of that which has been perceived]</span></em></li>\n\t<li>Mental formations arise from Direct Perception or from Inference. [The use of the word Perception is probably different from previous use.] Both can result in a wrong view/conclusion.</li>\n\t<li>Impermanence and Non-self are essentially the same things. One is in regard to time and the other is in regard to space. Store consciousness is itself impermanent and has no separate self.</li>\n\t<li>Buddhism also talks about Karma, but that concept has no value in absence of birth-rebirth. But again, the concept of birth-rebirth also demands investigation. In any case, actions will definitely leave imprints on store consciousness.</li>\n\t<li>Interpenetration means that the all is in one.

Then the whole engine of survival, mentation, cognition, thinking, measuring, reasoning, clinging arises.</li>\n\t<li>[Where do thoughts come from?]&nbsp;The objects of mind (thoughts, cognitions) do not arise from the external world the way that objects of form, sound, taste, and tactile sensation do. Instead, they come from the working of manas with the seeds in our store consciousness. <span style=\"color:#f39c12;\"><em>[Are thoughts possible if an organism has not had the other forms of consciousness experiences?

Yes, time also is result of ignorance]</em></li>\n\t<li>The goal of meditation is to change at the root of manas and the store consciousness. You cannot succeed if you practice meditation with your mind consciousness only. Don&#39;t think or reason too much about the things you learn from a meditation teacher. Instead, sow the Dharma seeds in your store consciousness each day.</li>\n\t<li>5 particular mental formations: Zeal (the quality of attraction), determination (discernment - you think you have recognized the object, you form an idea of it), mindfulness or remembering (smriti) (means the object of your attention has come to exist in the here and now for you; you recall it and it is as if it were real), concentration (samadhi) (focus your attention on that object), wisdom (prajna) (that you believe you know exactly what the object is). These are not found at all times in every consciousness.</li>\n\t<li>Anger results from basically an attempt to preserve the self <span style=\"color:#f39c12;\"><em>[at least it can be seen so, rationally]</em></span>, but it actually does the harm more to the one who is angry than the other.</li>\n\t<li>Knowledge obstacles - things/ideas which make us cling to knowledge we have and stop us from trying to gain more knowledge/insight/understanding.&nbsp;&nbsp;Obstacle of affliction - emotions which stop us from gaining knowledge/unserstanding, clarity of mind etc.&nbsp;Affliction-obstacles need more time, more practice, to dissolve.</li>\n\t<li>There are two kinds of attachment to self. One was already there when we were born, and the other is acquired during our lifetime. <span style=\"color:#8e44ad;\"><em>[We don&#39;t just have animal body, we have mental body]</em></span></li>\n\t<li>When we are feeling sad, everything looks different. When we are happy everything looks beautiful. The things are not beautiful in themselves. It is our mental image that makes them one way or the other. [This may be exaggeration, but it is true that our perception is tainted by our mental state]</li>\n\t<li>Consciousness contains both subject and object <span style=\"color:#f39c12;\"><em>[To me this statements seems to carry no weight. Intellectually, it doesn&#39;t mean much, except that &#39;Yes, as far as I as a subject am concerned, even objects come later (secondary)&#39;. Experientially I need to see]</em></span></li>\n\t<li>When we perceive, it is done either with the simultaneous engagement of mind, or without mind (mentation, thought, cognition etc). Mind also seems to function independent of sense faculties e.g. in case of dreams. <span style=\"color:#8e44ad;\"><em>[Without attention, our perception is as good as non-existent] [Dreams contain a world of mere images, although sensory inputs might play some role intermittently]</em></span></li>\n\t<li>Mind operates in conjunction with sense consciousnesses, or independently, or in dispersion mode (Monkey Mind), or in mindful/concentrated mode, or in unstable/psychotic mode. Yoga/Meditation aims to get rid of Dispersive mode and enter Concentration mode.&nbsp;When all senses are operating simultaneously, our concentration in&nbsp;any one of them is less strong.</li>\n\t<li>Babies when experience things with their senses, till the point they have not formed conceptions about things, that way of looking is the direct mode of perception, and through it the realm of things-in-themselves can be reached. <span style=\"color:#f39c12;\"><em>[Babies definitely have mental concepts of space and time, what else do they have?

Each moment the phenomena are produced again and again (as a stream), and the conditions of continuation gives us illusion of solid enduring entity.

This mind-field can also be called &quot;all the seeds&quot;.[1]</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>A &quot;field&quot; of &quot;seeds&quot; - Sarvabijaka (All-The-Seeds)</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>In us are infinite varieties of seeds - seeds of samsara, nirvana, delusion, and enlightenment, seeds of suffering and happiness, seeds of perceptions, names, and words.[2]</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Samsara: the cycle of suffering, our dwelling place when we live in ignorance. Ignorance of what? - True Wisdom.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How does this cycle continue? -</p>\n\n<p>Nirvana: stability, freedom, and the cessation of the cycle of suffering.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Seeds that manifest as body and mind, as realms of being, stages, and worlds, are all stored in our consciousness. That is why it is called &quot;store&quot;.[3]</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>There&#39;s a reason they are called &quot;seeds&quot;, it&#39;s because they manifest themselves or become dormant depending on whether you water them.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Some seeds are innate, handed down by our ancestors. Some were sown while we were still in the womb, others were sown when we were children. [4]</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>How does this field of seeds accumulate?</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp; By transmission from parents, By Perceptions: These all go to &quot;Store Consciousness&quot;</p>\n\n<p>We see an object =&gt; Image =&gt; One seed</p>\n\n<p>We assign a label to this image =&gt; Name =&gt; Another seed.</p>\n\n<p>They both become interlinked.</p>\n\n<p>Three pairs of Signs of Phenomena (&quot;dharma&quot;):</p>\n\n<ol>\n\t<li>Universal - Particular pair</li>\n\t<li>Unity - Diversity</li>\n\t<li>Formation - Disintegration</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Universal Sign like &quot;house&quot; is general. Particular signs accumulate when we perceive details of houses. The house can be seen as the whole (universal sign) or a combination of its parts (particular sign). This goes for everything.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp; <em>[What comes first? - The universal or the particular. As per Buddhism they come together, they inter-are]</em></p>\n\n<p>Like in the case of &quot;house&quot; (the universal sign) one house is not different from the other; that&#39;s &quot;unity&quot;. Still, when we consider, there are countless variations of &quot;house&quot; (the particular sign) that&#39;s &quot;diversity&quot;.</p>\n\n<p>When we look at any phenomena, we should be able to see &#39;unity in diversity and &#39;diversity in unity&#39;.</p>\n\n<p>Like in the case of a house, while it is being built (formation), the parts of it or constituents of it might already have started being disintegrated.</p>\n\n<p>Mediation is to train us to see both the aspects of these pairs (teaching of &quot;inter-being&quot;)</p>\n\n<p>When we fall in love, the image of our beloved that we hold in our minds may be quite different from the actual person. In that case, you might say that we end up marrying our false perceptions rather than the person herself.</p>\n\n<p><em>[How do false perceptions (conceptions) arise? And how are they broken?]</em></p>\n\n<p>Perceptions based on prejudices developed from the seeds of past experiences in your store consciousness. You consider these false perceptions to be true.</p>\n\n<p>We live in a universe filled with false images and delusions, yet we believe that we are truly in touch with the world. Before something manifests, we say that it doesn&#39;t exist. Once we are able to perceive it, then we say that it exists. But even though&nbsp;a phenomenon is unmanifested, it is always there. <em>[Does it matter if we have no way of knowing it?]</em></p>\n\n<p>Three Realms of being:</p>\n\n<ol>\n\t<li>Desire (kamadhatu)</li>\n\t<li>Form (Rupadhatu)</li>\n\t<li>Non-Form (Arupadhatu)</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>In the realm of Desire you meet craving, anger, arrogance, and delusion.</p>\n\n<p>When we choose to live simply and abandon some of our cravings, we are in the realm of form. In the third realm, materiality is absent. Only energy is present, and this energy manifests as our mind, our anger, our suffering, and so forth. Life continues, but there is no perception of form.</p>\n\n<p>Consciousness receives and is impregnated with all the experiences and perceptions that come to us through seeing, hearing, smelling, tasting, and touching. Our experiences and perceptions then become seeds in our store consciousness. This is called &quot;impregnation&quot; (vasana). We may think we have forgotten something, but nothing that the store consciousness receives is lost; everything is stored there, unmanifested, until the conditions for its manifestations are present.</p>\n\n<p>Not only we receive seeds from our ancestors, but we also receive them during mother&#39;s pregnancy. Every perception, joy of our mother and father penetrates us as a seed.</p>\n\n<p>How about an &quot;Institute of Family&quot;, where parents-to-be can go before marrying and practice for a year or two to learn how to look deeply into their seeds that they will pass on to their children? Parents should keep a record of the joys and difficulties they have during the time before and after conception and record of the suffering, happiness, and significant events during the life of the child, from age one to ten. The child may forget these things, but if parents can tell their children these things, it will be very helpful to them later, after they have grown up and when it is time for them to go and study at the institute.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Whether transmitted by family, friends, society, or education, all our seeds are, by nature, both individual and collective. [5]</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>If you say Plum Village <em>[for example]</em> is both an objective and a subjective reality, that is not exactly correct. You may think there is an objective reality of Plum Village that you will be able to grasp some day, though you have only experienced the subjective reality of Plum Village in your own consciousness, But what you call &quot;objective&quot; also arises from your consciousness. Our consciousness includes both individual and collective, subjective and objective. The objective reality we think exists independently of our sense perception is itself a creation of collective consciousness. Our ideas of happiness and suffering, beauty and ugliness are reflections of the ideas of many people.</p>\n\n<p><em>[But how does collective consciousness happen?]</em></p>\n\n<p>Some things start out as creations of individual consciousness and then become part of collective consciousness.</p>\n\n<p>You believe that you have your own notion of beauty, but if you look deeply you will find that it has been formed from notions of many other people. When you shop for a necklace, you think that it is you who chooses the tie. But the moment you see the tie that aligns with the seeds in your store consciousness, the necklace chooses you. You think you have exercised your freedom of choice, but the choice was already made a long time ago.</p>\n\n<p><em>[But what about the creative people who come up with new things?]</em></p>\n\n<p>No seed in our consciousness is one hundred percent innate or one hundred percent transmitted. It is not that some seeds are purely individual and some are purely collective. If you are a good musician, the seed of that ability is considered to be your individual seed, but if we look deeply we can see its collective nature as well. You might have received this ability from your ancestors, from your teachers, or even from listening to the radio. <em>[It&#39;s the result of a chaotic system]</em></p>\n\n<p>The distinction between innate and transmitted seeds, between individual and collective is provisional. These distinctions are established in order to help us better understand on an intellectual level seemingly opposite concepts so that we can work with them in our practice. <em>[So, our intellect works based on distinctions to work and navigate in the world. But the whole problem is that not everyone sees the inter-being nature]</em></p>\n\n<p>When our practice matures, when we see the nature of interbeing of everything, we no longer need these distinctions.</p>\n\n<p>We may believe that we are non-violent, but there is the seed of violence in us that has been watered by television, newspapers, or by what we have seen or experienced. If we see deeply, we find that this seed has both individual and collective nature at the same time.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>The quality of our life depends on the quality of the seeds that lie deep in our consciousness. [6]</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>When our own wholesome seeds are still weak, we need to associate ourselves with friends who water the seeds of health, happiness, and peace in us. We need to know when we are strong enough to help, or we may be overwhelmed by the difficult seeds in the other person.</p>\n\n<p>When someone comes to us for guidance, or we want to help someone, we need to look deeply into that person in order to see the seeds that are lying deep in their consciousness. Offering only some general teaching or advice will not really help them. If we look deeply, we can recognize the quality of the seeds in that person. This is called &quot;observing the circumstances&quot;. Then we can recommend&nbsp;a specific path of practice to nurture the positive seeds and to transform the negative ones.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>The function of store consciousness is to receive and maintain seeds and their habit energies, so they can manifest in the world, or remain dormant. [7]</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Jean-Paul Sartre said, &quot;man is the sum of his acts&quot;. Each of us is a collection of our actions, and our actions are both the cause and effect of seeds in our store consciousness. Every act we make through our body, speech, and mind sows seeds in our consciousness.</p>\n\n<p>There are three kinds of action: Mind action (thought), speech action, and bodily action. Consciousness does not hold on only mind actions. The seeds of our speech actions and bodily actions also travel with our store consciousness from this world to another.</p>\n\n<p>The Eightfold Path of Buddha has four practices for Right Effort:</p>\n\n<ol>\n\t<li>Prevent unwholesome seeds that have not yet manifested from manifesting. &quot;Unwholesome&quot; means not conducive to liberation.</li>\n\t<li>Help the unwholesome seeds that have already arisen in our mind consciousness to return to store consciousness.</li>\n\t<li>Find ways to water the wholesome seeds in our store consciousness that have not yet arisen, to help them manifest in our mind consciousness.</li>\n\t<li>Maintain as long as we can the mental formations that have already arisen from the wholesome seeds on the level of our mind consciousness.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>We have seeds of both positive and negative. But somehow seeds of negative need less watering. It takes time for a young person to appreciate Shakespear, but it doesn&#39;t take long at all to learn to drink alcohol.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Manifestations from store consciousness can be perceived directly in the mode of things-in-themselves, as representations, or as mere images. All are included in the eighteen elements of being. [8]</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>There are three modes/fields of perception:</p>\n\n<ol>\n\t<li>Things in themselves (Suchness or Thathata - reality as it is)</li>\n\t<li>As representations</li>\n\t<li>As mere images</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Kantian philosophy also mentions the first one: The distinction between <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noumenon\" target=\"_blank\">Noumenon</a> (Things-in-themselves) and Phenomenon (Things-as-they-appear)</p>\n\n<p>Are we capable of touching reality-in-itself?</p>\n\n<p>The western philosophers say no. But Buddhist teachings say yes we can.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><em>[Maybe we can never see things-in-themselves as an objective reality, but at least ]</em> we can see the things as they are according to our first five <em>[senses/]</em> consciousnesses if mind consciousness does not get involved. It&#39;s when mind consciousness gets involved that we start forming representations and images. A table, for example, is seen as something on which we can put things, termites see it as a source of food, dogs might think of it as something on which they can sit, all of this is representations, formed by mind consciousness.</p>\n\n<p>We don&#39;t even know what an electron is when we look deeply, and yet here is a human being sitting next to us and we think we already know everything about him/her. This is because we just see in the second or third mode. <em>[But what do I do? When I try to explore people, they all go to the same things over and over....] </em></p>\n\n<p>We hate or love depending on images we ourselves create.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>When you see a rope in darkness, your mind automatically alerts you and you think it&#39;s a snake. That&#39;s image perception. <em>[There&#39;s a reason for that. Our mind is hardcoded to take shortcuts to detect hazardous situations. What if I have never seen a snake?]</em></p>\n\n<p>Even our mind consciousness can sometimes touch the realm of suchness when we have strong intuition. Intuition is a form of knowing that is not based on thinking and imagining.</p>\n\n<p>Even when we actually touch the paper - the object of our perception - with our fingers and our eyes, the thing that appears to our perception is not the paper&#39;s suchness, but a representation. <em>[Can we ever do that?]</em></p>\n\n<p><em>[We can never see the things-in-themselves because our very nature of navigating the world is based on distinctions, categories etc. ]</em></p>\n\n<p>However, the purpose <em>[the end goal]</em> of meditation is to do exactly that i.e. to correct the tendency to discriminate and think dualistically.</p>\n\n<p>What conditions do you need to be truly happy? If those conditions are never realized, will you suffer for the rest of your life <em>[and if they are realized, are you sure you will be happy?]</em> Or could you manage to be happy even without them?</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>All manifestations bear the marks of both the individual and the collective. The maturation of store consciousness functions in the same way in its participation in the different stages and realms of being. [9]</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>A seed always needs the right amount of time and the right conditions in order to ripen and bring forth fruit. The ripening of phenomena happens in three ways:</p>\n\n<ol>\n\t<li>Ripening at different times: different seeds take different amounts of time to ripen.</li>\n\t<li>Ripening of different varieties: an unripe banana seed cannot ripen into an orange.</li>\n\t<li>Ripening and changing: When something ripens, many of its aspects change completely. An unripe orange is green and sour. A ripe one is orange and sweet.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p><em>[The time of ripening is indeterminate though, and the conditions are unknown. The only way to know is to try. That&#39;s why it is said in Bhagvad Gita: &quot;Karmanyevadhikarshte ma faleshu kadachana, ma karmfalheturbhurma te sangostavakarmani&quot;]</em></p>\n\n<p>Law of Affinity brings forth communities, groups. Our aspirations, our needs, and the energy of our actions determine whether we participate in one realm or stage of being or another. When the seed of affinity ripens, we find ourselves drawn to a particular person or situation. <em>[What about lonely people?] </em></p>\n\n<p>Whether we go in one of eight realms (gods, demons, humans, hungry ghosts, hell, or animals) is already established within our store consciousness. Those who are interested only in eating, sleeping, and having sex will come together in the realm of desire. Those who are concerned about the suffering people in the world will find ways to come together in order to serve. This is the Law of Affinity.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Unobstructed and indeterminate, store consciousness is continuously flowing and changing. At the same time, it is endowed with all five universal mental formations. [10]</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>All phenomena are of three natures:&nbsp;</p>\n\n<ol>\n\t<li>Wholesome (Kushala)</li>\n\t<li>Unwholesome (Akushala)</li>\n\t<li>Indeterminate (Aniyata): none of the above; depends on the situation</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>There are five universal mental formations (<em>universal meaning they act on all eight levels of consciousness)</em>&nbsp;:</p>\n\n<ol>\n\t<li>Contact (Sparsha)</li>\n\t<li>Attention (Manaskara)</li>\n\t<li>Feeling (Vedana)</li>\n\t<li>Perception or Conceptualization (Samjna)</li>\n\t<li>Volition (Chetana)</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>These are &quot;associated&quot; i.e. they are engaged with each other. These mental formations come forth in three modes of perception: Direct, Deduced, Erroneous.</p>\n\n<p>Direct perception (does not involve thoughts or imagination, it is not the result of comparison or reasoning) In the store consciousness Direct Perception is the only mode of perception.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Although impermanent and without a separate self, store consciousness contains all phenomena in the cosmos, both conditioned and unconditioned, in the form of seeds. [11]</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Impermanence and Non-self are essentially the same things. One is in regard to time and the other is in regard to space. Store consciousness is itself impermanent and has no separate self. Phenomena (Dharmas) can be Conditioned, Unconditioned.</p>\n\n<p>Conditioned - When we say something is conditioned it means that it has to inter-be with everything else. No separate existence. The deluded mind can touch only Conditioned phenomena including birth, death, mental formations etc.</p>\n\n<p>Unconditioned - means something and all-the-things at the same time without any distinction. Nirvana.</p>\n\n<p>Phenomena <em>[as far as actions are concerned]</em> can be (1) With leaks (ashrava), (2) Without leaks (anashrava). Without leaks are the ones which do not leave Karmic imprints. E.g. if you go to an orphanage to make a donation, and you are given a register to write down your name and sign if you look at it to find out who has given what amount of donation to decide for yourself, that is a good deed but with leaks.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Seeds can produce seeds, Seeds can produce formations, formations can produce seeds, formations can produce formations. [12]</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Phenomena can be in the form of seeds or formations. They are all inter-connected, one can cause the other. &quot;Formation&quot; means what has been manifested.</p>\n\n<p>Tell your partner, &quot;Darling, if you really love me, do not touch the negative seeds in me too often.&quot;</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Seeds and formations both have the nature of interbeing and interpenetration. The one is produced by the all. The all is dependent on the one. [13]</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Interpenetration means that all is in one. Nothing can exist on its own. Buddha said, &quot;This is because that is&quot;. Some physicists have a similar idea: <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Implicate_and_explicate_order\" target=\"_blank\">Implicit and Explicit Order</a>.</p>\n\n<p>In the historical dimension (somewhat similar to explicit order) there are notions of birth and death, beginning and end, this and that, being and non-being. But in the ultimate dimension, there is no birth and death, beginning and ending, being and non-being. The ultimate dimension cannot be described in words and notions that by their very nature serve to cut reality up into separate pieces.</p>\n\n<p><em>[Then the problem is that we are limited by notions, language for communication]</em></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Store consciousness is neither the same nor different, individual nor collective. Same and different inter-are. Collective and individual give rise to each other. [14]</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Nagarjuna&#39;s Eight Negations:&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Birth means an idea that something arises from nothing. <em>[That something is rather a course, always changing, so either the birth is always happening or never happened.]</em> But is not so. We already existed before our birth, although in a different form. In the same way, something cannot become nothing; it cannot completely disappear and cease to exist. <em>[Scientifically we have probed that everything just converts, mass into energy, energy into mass.]</em></p>\n\n<p>Store consciousness of you is neither same, nor different from store consciousness of me. There is no you, no me.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>When delusion is overcome, understanding is there, and store consciousness is no longer subject to afflictions. Store consciousness becomes Great Mirror Wisdom, reflecting the cosmos in all directions. Its name is now Pure Consciousness. [15]</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prat%C4%ABtyasamutp%C4%81da\" target=\"_blank\">Pratitya-Samutpada</a></p>\n\n<p>Ignorance (Avidya) -(conditions)-&gt; Impulses (Samskara) -&gt; Consciousness (Vijnana) -&gt; mind/body a.ka. name and form (Namarupa) -&gt; six sense organs (Shadayatana) -&gt; Contact (Sparsha) -&gt; Feelings (Vedana) -&gt; Craving (Trishna) -&gt; Grasping (Upadana) -&gt; Becoming (Bhava) -&gt; Birth (Jati) -&gt; Death (Jara-maranam).</p>\n\n<p>This is the engine that drives the cycle of samsara.</p>\n\n<p>When ignorance is removed, store consciousness becomes Pure Consciousness. Store consciousness is neutral by itself, wholesome or unwholesome seeds in the store consciousness manifest depending on the activity of the other consciousness.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Seeds of delusion give rise to the internal formations of craving and afflictions. These forces animate our consciousness as mind and body manifest themselves. [16]</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Manas grasps onto the image that it has created and clings to it as its object. And everything that it loves is linked to this self by manas. Manas also serves as our &quot;survival instinct&quot;. The activity of manas is thinking, cognizing, measuring, reasoning, grasping, and clinging. Day and night, manas discriminates things. It gives rise to a sense of separate self with mental formations.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>With store consciousness as its support, manas arises. Its function is mentation, grasping the seeds it considers to be a &quot;self&quot;. [17]</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The objects of mind (thoughts, cognitions) do not arise from the external world the way that objects of form, sound, taste, and tactile sensation do. Instead, they come from the working of manas with the seeds in our store consciousness. When we talk about consciousness, we usually think of it as having two aspects, subject and object. The Manifestations Only teachings say, every psychological phenomenon has three aspects: a subject (darshan-bhaga), an object (nimitta-bhaga), and the basis that makes both subject and object possible, which is the thing-in-itself (svabhava-bhaga).</p>\n\n<p>All manas does is to think and calculate: &quot;This is me&quot;. This is called mentation (manana).</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>The object of manas is the mark of a self found in the field of representations at the point where manas and store consciousness touch. [18]</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Four conditions for the manifestations of all phenomena:</p>\n\n<ol>\n\t<li>Cause as condition (Hetu-pratyaya) - even though the cause itself is limiting, the result can nevertheless be significant.</li>\n\t<li>Condition for development (Adhipati-pratyaya): Favourable and Non-favourable conditions. Not all unfavorable conditions bring about unwholesome result. Sometimes unfavorable (adverse) conditions stop us from doing something destructive.</li>\n\t<li>Object as condition (Alambana-pratyaya): the object of perception</li>\n\t<li>Condition of immediate continuity (Samanantara-pratyaya): Every manifestation of a phenomenon needs continuity, otherwise it is cut off.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Manas looks at the store consciousness (which is actually like an ocean) with attachment and makes a portion of it into an object that it can cling to. When we speak about eight consciousnesses, we are really talking about eight functions of consciousness.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>As the ground of wholesome and unwholesome of the other six manifesting consciousnesses, manas continues discriminating. Its nature is both indeterminate and obscured. [19]</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Indeterminate =&gt; neither wholesome, nor unwholesome. Obscured =&gt; Covered up.</p>\n\n<p>The goal of meditation is to change at the root of manas and the store consciousness. You cannot succeed if you practice meditation with your mind consciousness only. Don&#39;t think or reason too much about the things you learn from a meditation teacher. Instead, sow the Dharma seeds in your store consciousness each day.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Manas goes with the five universals, with mati if the five particulars, and with the four major and eight secondary afflictions. All are indeterminate and obscrured. [20]</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>5 universal mental formations: Contact, Attention, Feelings, Perception, and Volition. They are present in every consciousness. Through the activity of these manas grasps the store consciousness and regards it as a self.</p>\n\n<p>5 particular mental formations: Zeal (the quality of attraction), determination (discernment - you think you have recognized the object, you form an idea of it), mindfulness or remembering (smriti) (means the object of your attention has come to exist in the here and now for you; you recall it and it is as if it were real), concentration (samadhi) (focus your attention on that object), wisdom (prajna) (that you believe you know exactly what the object is). These are not found at all times in every consciousness.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>As shadow follows form, manas always follows store. It is a misguided attempt to survive, craving for continuation and blind satisfaction. [21]</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Manas behaves automatically, instinctively, blindly following the store consciousness (a portion of it). Manas tries to manifest whatever is in favor of survival, continuation of &quot;self&quot;, satisfaction but it does not capture the whole phenomena, hence it is often misguided and does harm instead of good. An example, anger results from basically an attempt to preserve the self, but it actually does the harm more to the one who is angry than the other.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>When the first stage of the bodhisattva path is attained, the obstacles of knowledge and afflictions are transformed. At the tenth stage, the yogi transforms the belief in a separate self, and store consciousness is released from manas. [22]</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>There are ten stages on the path of bodhisattva. The first is of joy, you feel joy after putting an end to the noise, the demands, and the stressful activities of the everyday life. When bodhisattva enters the first stage he or she realizes the transformation of obstacles. Obstacle of Knowledge means that we cling to the knowledge that we have and think that there is nothing more to know. Obstacle of affliction is in the realm of emotions. Our envy, hatred, anger, sadness, despair, and anxiety are all obstacles of afflictions. Our point of view, perception, and learning are all the objects of our knowledge, and these are the things that prevent us from going ahead.</p>\n\n<p>Affliction-obstacles need more time, more practice, to dissolve.</p>\n\n<p>When bodhisattva arrives at the eighth stage, the belief in an innate self is transformed. Before this maybe he has attained some intellectual knowledge of nonself, but it was not released.</p>\n\n<p>There are two kinds of attachment to self. One was already there when we were born, and the other is acquired during our lifetime.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>With manas as its base and phenomena as its objects, mind consciousness manifests itself. Its sphere of cognition is the broadest. [23]</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Mind consciousness has three modes of perception, It has access to the three fields of perception and is capable of having three natures. All mental formations manifest in it - universal, particular, wholesome, unwholesome and indeterminate. [24]</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Three modes of perception: direct, inference, and wrong perception. Actually, both of the first two can fall into the third category when they are wrong. Sometimes we just see something as a snake (direct perception) but actually it might not be a snake (wrong perception); <em>[this happens because of our evolutionary brain mechanism.]</em> We often operate in the third mode of perception.</p>\n\n<p>When we are feeling sad, everything looks different. When we are happy everything looks beautiful. The things are not beautiful in themselves. It is our mental image that makes them one way or the other.</p>\n\n<p>Rather than acting on the perceptions (which could be false even though you believe them to be true), you should investigate that perception deeply, you can take help from your friends by discussing this perception with them. <em>[But I often find that the more I listen to people, the more confused I become].</em></p>\n\n<p>Our ideas of space and time, and everything in them, are also objects of our perception. If we think they exist independent of our mind, we need to look again. <em>[This is a bold and unprovable claim about the physical universe]</em></p>\n\n<p>Knowing always includes the subject who knows and the object that is known. Before we can speak about awareness, we have to ask, &quot;awareness of what?&quot; This is basic, but not easy to understand. Even if we think we understand something, our understanding may be limited. Please practice this diligently, and one day you will see - not merely intellectually, but in the actual experience of your life - that consciousness contains both subject and object.</p>\n\n<p>Has it ever happened that you gaze at a snow-capped mountain and feel that you are the mountain itself, that the mountain is not separate from you? Or when you contemplate the ocean you feel that you are immense.</p>\n\n<p>This is called the mode of non-thinking, non-distinction. This generally happens sometimes for very brief moments, because our usual patterns of thinking do not allow for this to happen often.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Mind consciousness is the root of all actions of body and speech. Its nature is to manifest mental formations, but its existence is not continuous. Mind consciousness gives rise to actions that lead to ripening. It plays the role of the gardener, sowing all the seeds.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Mind consciousness, unlike manas, stops working sometimes e.g. when sleeping, when fainted when doing no-mind meditation. It gives rise to actions that lead to the ripening of wholesome and unwholesome seeds in store consciousness.</p>\n\n<p>We act and speak on the basis of our thinking, our cognition.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Mind consciousness is always functioning except in states of non-perception, the two attainments, deep sleep, and fainting or coma.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>In my next life, may I not be born human but as a pine tree singing between heaven and earth. - Poet Nguyen Cing Tru</p>\n\n<p>On our own planet, there are species of living creatures that do not have perception, that are&nbsp;active without perception, and perhaps they have more happiness because mind consciousness does not function without perception. With meditation, we can achieve this mode of non-perception.</p>\n\n<p>The two attainments are:</p>\n\n<p>attainment of non-perception (<em>asamjnika samapatti</em>): No perception, no need for perception.</p>\n\n<p>attainment of cessation (<em>norodha samapatti</em>): No perception, no feelings, no cognition.</p>\n\n<p><em>[Is this impossible to attain?]</em></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Mind consciousness operates in five ways -&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>in cooperation with the five sense consciousnesses</p>\n\n<p>and independent of them,</p>\n\n<p>dispersed, concentrated, or unstably.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>When we look at the flower and are aware that we are looking at a flower, that is a case of mind consciousness cooperating with one of the five sense consciousnesses. But if we look at a flower while our mind is occupied with something else, our mind consciousness is operating independently of our sense consciousness. This happens a lot in our daily life <em>inattentiveness, lost in thoughts</em>. When mind consciousness acts independently, as when we are dreaming, there is no coordination with the other five sense consciousnesses. We can continue to see, hear, smell, taste, and touch - but our seeing, hearing, tasting, and so on, is occuring only in the realm of mere images. We don&#39;t need our actual eyes, ears, nose, tongue, or body for this. Mere images are available to our mind consciousness from the seeds that are in our store consciousness.</p>\n\n<p>Mental activities of mind consciousness can operate alone independent of sense organs. E.g. when feeling of anger arises, without any activity from sense organs. Mindfulness also can occur when the mind consciousness works in cooperation with the five sense consciousnesses or when it is operating on its own.</p>\n\n<p>Dispersion is the third way (apart from working in conjunction with sense consciousnesses and independent of them) our mind consciousness operates. When we are thinking about one thing after another, when we are anxious, sad, suspicious, or imagining things, and there is no coordination of mind consciousness with the sense consciousnesses, it is called &quot;distracted mind consciousness&quot;. Mind consciousness is working alone, in dispersion. Monkey mind.</p>\n\n<p>In Buddhist meditation, bringing our mind from scattered mode to one-pointedness, is called Eka-grata. The point of focus can be our breathing, a leaf, a pebble, a flower, or the object of our meditative focus. Mindfulness leads us to the fourth manner of operation of mind consciousness, <strong>concentration</strong>. The stronger and clearer our mindfulness, the more stable our concentration. Mindfulness always brings about concentration.</p>\n\n<p>The fifth way that mind consciousness operates is unstable, in neurotic or psychotic states of mind. In order to heal, we have to generate whatever amount of mindfulness we can in order to begin to see things more clearly, to recognize things as they are. We may need the support of mindfulness of our therapist, friends and family to help us as we get in touch with the inner conflicts between our feelings and our perceptions.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Based on mind consciousness,</p>\n\n<p>the five sense consciousnesses,</p>\n\n<p>separately or together with mind consciousness,&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>manifest like waves on water.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>When all senses are operating simultaneously, our concentration in&nbsp;any one of them is less strong. The energy of the battery, our mind consciousness, is finite. So when we concentrate our mind and focus it on one of the sense consciousnesses, the energy it can give to the task at hand will be steadier.</p>\n\n<p>Functioning independently of mind consciousness, the five sense consciousnesses have a better chance to experience things-in-themselves than when they are operating in tandem with mind consciousness. But mind consciousness almost always discriminates. Even if we are able to touch the world of suchness for a few seconds, we immediately lose contact with it. Vikalpa, the tendency to discriminate between things, to see things as this or that, as separate from and outside of one another, keeps us from staying in touch with the realm of suchness. All the objects of sensation we perceive are transformed into representations, conditioned by the seeds of delusion in our store consciousness.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Their field of perception is things-in-themselves.</p>\n\n<p>Their mode of perception is direct.</p>\n\n<p>Their nature can be wholesome, unwholesome, or neutral.</p>\n\n<p>They operate on the sense organs and sensation center of the brain.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Babies when experience things with their senses, till the point they have not formed conceptions about things, that way of looking is the direct mode of perception, and through it the realm of things-in-themselves can be reached.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n", "authorId": 1, "subject": "psychology", "tags": [], "img": "", "summary": "", "lastUpdated": "2021-05-09 05:20:13.477043"}
