If your system responds within 1 second if I ask it for something, does it mean that it is Good?</em></div>\n\n<p><br />\nThere are many parameters on which system performance is measured.</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>Short&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Response_time_(technology)\" title=\"Response time (technology)\">response time</a>&nbsp;for a given piece of work.&nbsp;</li>\n\t<li>High&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Throughput\" title=\"Throughput\">throughput</a>&nbsp;(rate of processing work). How many requests can it process per hour, for example?</li>\n\t<li>Low utilization of&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computing_resource\" title=\"Computing resource\">computing resource</a>(s)</li>\n\t<li><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_availability\" title=\"High availability\">High availability</a>&nbsp;of the computing system or application. When I ask for something it should respond (<em>at least</em>) every time.</li>\n\t<li>Fast (or highly compact)&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_compression\" title=\"Data compression\">data compression</a>&nbsp;and decompression.</li>\n\t<li>High&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bandwidth_(computing)\" title=\"Bandwidth (computing)\">bandwidth</a>&nbsp;(how much data can be transferred at max, per hour&nbsp;for example).</li>\n\t<li>Short&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_transmission\" title=\"Data transmission\">data transmission</a>&nbsp;time.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>Possible scenarios:</h2>\n\n<p>Most of the users of your system are getting slow response.</p>\n\n<p>Some of the users are getting slow response, while others are getting fast enough response.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Sometimes users get fast response, sometimes they get slow response.</p>\n\n<p>Sometimes, your application becomes so slow as if it is not responding at all. It could be momentary scenario.</p>\n\n<p>From multiple requests from client application (e.g. a composed web-page), some requests are fast, some are slow.</p>\n\n<h2><span style=\"font-family:Lucida Sans Unicode,Lucida Grande,sans-serif;\">Round-Trip-Time a.k.a. Response-Time (for a single transaction)</span></h2>\n\n<p>What is this? - From the time I make a request to the time I get a response back.</p>\n\n<p>How would you measure this in practical scenarios? Simple method is by taking &quot;Average&quot; of response times. But don&#39;t take average as (arithmetic) Mean, instead take it as Median, which will be 50-percentile. By plotting in percentile on a graph, you&#39;ll know how much delay do outliers (e.g. in 90-percentile area) get.</p>\n\n<p><font face=\"Lucida Sans Unicode, Lucida Grande, sans-serif\">This depends on the following:-</font></p>\n\n<ol>\n\t<li>Network I/O Time: for transfer and disseminating data between servers and to the correct location within the system.</li>\n\t<li>Disk I/O Time: for enrollment when the transaction reaches the correct stage of enrollment.</li>\n\t<li>CPU Load over a number of cores at various stages</li>\n\t<li>Speed and performance of DBMS running over your physical machines.</li>\n\t<li>Right Amount of DB partitioning for in-memory search and response time within various stages of a multi-stage system.</li>\n\t<li>The correct amount of RAM on each server, based on what the software processes running on them require, to reduce cost, but avoid allowing the OS to utilize virtual memory page swapping to disk.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p><strong>Latency affects Response-Time, but is not the same thing:&nbsp;</strong>Latency is the time by which processing of request becomes late, i.e. it&#39;s just waiting there in the queue on your server, waiting to be processed.</p>\n\n<h2><span style=\"font-family:Lucida Sans Unicode,Lucida Grande,sans-serif;\">Total Transaction-<em>Throughput</em> (Number of Transactions per Second)</span></h2>\n\n<p>What is this? - How many transactions (read/writes) to the system, can I perform in a second.</p>\n\n<p>Remember, it only takes a small number of slow requests to hold up the processing of subsequent requests</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n", "authorId": 1, "subject": "architectures", "tags": [], "img": "", "summary": "", "lastUpdated": "2021-01-26 06:28:31.741001"}
