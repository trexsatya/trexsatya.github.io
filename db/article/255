Motifs have strong connectivity b/w notes, to move on from the motif add (mostly perfect consonant) notes in the same direction as either the head or tail of motif.</li>\n\t<li>Add counterpoint voices, which can be played either together with the melody voice (hence forming chords) or can be played melodically. Think like voices talking to each other, sometimes singing together, sometimes one voice acting as background to the other etc.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Compositional Ideas from mundane things:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bIQE5IZVqt4\">Empty Fridge</a> - you just need a starter melodic phrase, then can add different things - like variation, space/breath, tension, release etc depending on the context.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h2>Time Signature</h2>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://youtu.be/cmxbVeuyIVc?t=386\" target=\"_blank\">Simple vs Compound</a>:</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h2>Intervals:</h2>\n\n<p>Practice Intervals.</p>\n\n<p>Prime, Major 2nd, Major 3rd, Perfect 4th, Perfect 5th, Major 6th, Major 7th, Perfect Octave.</p>\n\n<p>For P4 is one semitone away from M3, P8 is one semitone away from M7. All others are 2 semitones away from previous one.</p>\n\n<p>Perfect Intervals do not have Minor version. Others have minor version which is obtained by either lowering the upper tone, or raising the fundamental tone <em><strong>(In summary, reducing the major interval by a semitone)</strong></em>.</p>\n\n<p>All have augmented, diminished versions (except for Prime). Augmented is achieved by <strong><em>raising</em></strong><em><strong> the major interval by a semitone</strong></em>. Diminished is achieved by <em><strong>reducing the minor interval by a semitone.</strong></em></p>\n\n<p>Intervals exceeding the octave are just repetitions of the corresponding intervals. Except for Ninth, which has specific significance in harmony.</p>\n\n<p>Inversion of intervals: 2-7, 3-6, 4-5, 5-4, 6-3, 7-2, 8-1 are all inversions of 1-8. Major intervals become Minor, Minor becomes Major, Diminished becomes Augmented, Augmented becomes Diminished. Perfects remain as it is.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Consonant Intervals </strong>(those which are more stable, don&#39;t have a pull): P1, P8, P5, Major or minor Thirds, Sixths.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Dissonant Intervals </strong>(those which demand a goal or solution in the following interval): Seconds, Sevenths and all Augmented, Diminished are dissonant.</p>\n\n<p>Fourth can act as both Consonant, Dissonant.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h2>Harmony</h2>\n\n<p>Reference: Practical Guide To Harmony</p>\n\n<p>Chords: Multiple tones sounding together.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Consonant Chords: Triads </strong></p>\n\n<p>Triad: 3 tones separated from each other by interval of a <strong>Third</strong>.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Triads of a Major Scale:</strong></p>\n\n<p>Major Triads:</p>\n\n<p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">Tonic Triad - I</p>\n\n<p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">Subdominant Triad - IV</p>\n\n<p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">Dominant Triad - V</p>\n\n<p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">These 3 combined contain all the diatonic degrees of the scale, sound good together, are sufficient for harmonization of any melody that does not surpass the key in question.</p>\n\n<p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">Subdominant Triad,&nbsp;Dominant Triad are also <strong><em>tonic</em></strong>&nbsp; in those keys which are nearest to the given key in Circle Of Fifths.</p>\n\n<p>Minor Triads:</p>\n\n<p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">on II, III and VI degrees of scale.</p>\n\n<p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">The <strong>Minor Third</strong> interval in these triads impart a soft, weakened character, which can be used as a contrast to highlight the strenght of a Major triad. Their mutual affinity is same as that of major triads as they possess same proximity in Circle of Fifths.</p>\n\n<p>Can be grouped as:</p>\n\n<p><strong>Tonic Group:</strong> Triads on 1st and 6th degrees.&nbsp; I, VI</p>\n\n<p><strong>Dominant Group:</strong> Triads on 5th and 3rd degrees. V, III</p>\n\n<p><strong>Subdominant Group:</strong> Triads on 4th and 2nd degrees. IV, II</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>Triads of a Minor Scale (only 4 consonant triads):</strong></p>\n\n<p>Major Triads: on V, VI</p>\n\n<p>Minor Triads: on I, IV</p>\n\n<p>In the II, III, VII we find Dissonant intervals - diminished or augmented fifths.</p>\n\n<p>Dim-V is related to triads II, IV, V degrees, still it can properly be connected only with the Dominant Triad (keeping commont tones in the same voice), as the connection with other two would call for a step of an augmented second, which is vry unpleasant.</p>\n\n<p>Dim-II can be connected with triads IV, V, VI. However, avoid concealed Octaves and Fifths, &amp; the step of the augmented second.</p>\n\n<p>Aug-III can be connected with the triads on I, V, VI. <strong><em>This is seldom used as diatonic chord, but often used as chromatic or altered chord.</em></strong></p>\n\n<p>Connecting triad V to a triad VI, the leading tone is led upwards (so, third on 6th is doubled) to avoid the <em>augmented second</em>. Connecting VI to V, the third on VI should be doubled in the same vein.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>Four Part Harmony/ Four-Voiced Writing:</strong></p>\n\n<p>Outer Voices: Highest (Soprano) &amp; Deepest (Bass).</p>\n\n<p>Inner Voices: Alto, Tenor</p>\n\n<p>Chord Positions:</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Triads on scale have some common tones: e.g. C(ceg) and G(gbd) have g in common.</p>\n\n<p><em><strong>It&#39;s good to keep the common tone in the same voice. </strong>Don&#39;t choose too high a position of Tonic triad at the start.</em></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>Voice Motions:</strong></p>\n\n<p>Parallel Motion: 2 voices progress in one and same direction. <strong><em>Avoid</em></strong><em><strong> Parallel Fifths and Parallel Octaves </strong>(they are not pleasing to ear generally)</em>. [Harmonic intervals 5 5, 8 8 (using parallel motion)] [ x 5, x 8 (x=any) are also displeasing unless there&#39;s a common tone in the same voice]</p>\n\n<p>Oblique Motion: 1 voice remains stationary.</p>\n\n<p>Contrary Motion: 2 voices progress in opposite direction.</p>\n\n<p><strong>How do we connect 2 triads having no external relationship (i.e. common tone)</strong></p>\n\n<p>Use contrary motion without proceeding in great steps (leaps).</p>\n\n<p>Make bass step to Second interval, and using contrary motion, lead other voices into the nearest interval of the following chord.</p>\n\n<p>Deviation from the rules allowed only if contrary motion can be employed in Bass.</p>\n\n<p><em>Dominant to Tonic progression in Soprano Voice:</em> Keep in mind that leading tone (Third of the dominant chord) wants to resolve <em><strong>upward half a tone</strong></em> into tonic. So it cannot move to 3rd downward, however in inner voices it&#39;s fine to do so.</p>\n\n<p><em>Tonic to Subdominant progression in Soprano Voice</em>: Same as above.</p>\n\n<p>Diminished Triad on 7th scale degree should be used carefully.</p>\n\n<p>If diminished triad appears b/w two related triads, common tones must remain in the same voice.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>Avoid Parallel Fifth and Parallel Octaves (except for some rare cases).</strong></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<hr />\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><b><i>Given a bunch of notes, find the Chord. </i></b></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; - It could be Triad, or an Extended Chord</p>\n\n<p>- It could be in Root, or an Inversion</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><b><i>How to write Inversion</i></b></p>\n\n<p>Lead-sheet:</p>\n\n<p>Chord/3rd =&gt; First inversion.
