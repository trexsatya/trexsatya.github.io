All others are 2 semitones away from previous one.</p>\n\n<p>Perfect Intervals do not have Minor version. Others have minor version which is obtained by either lowering the upper tone, or raising the fundamental tone <em><strong>(In summary, reducing the major interval by a semitone)</strong></em>.</p>\n\n<p>All have augmented, diminished versions (except for Prime). Augmented is achieved by <strong><em>raising</em></strong><em><strong> the major interval by a semitone</strong></em>. Diminished is achieved by <em><strong>reducing the minor interval by a semitone.</strong></em></p>\n\n<p>Intervals exceeding the octave are just repetitions of the corresponding intervals. Except for Ninth, which has specific significance in harmony.</p>\n\n<p>Inversion of intervals: 2-7, 3-6, 4-5, 5-4, 6-3, 7-2, 8-1 are all inversions of 1-8. Major intervals become Minor, Minor becomes Major, Diminished becomes Augmented, Augmented becomes Diminished. Perfects remain as it is.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Consonant Intervals </strong>(those which are more stable, don&#39;t have a pull): P1, P8, P5, Major or minor Thirds, Sixths.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Dissonant Intervals </strong>(those which demand a goal or solution in the following interval): Seconds, Sevenths and all Augmented, Diminished are dissonant.</p>\n\n<p>Fourth can act as both Consonant, Dissonant.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h2>Harmony</h2>\n\n<p>Reference: Practical Guide To Harmony</p>\n\n<p>Chords: Multiple tones sounding together.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Consonant Chords: Triads </strong></p>\n\n<p>Triad: 3 tones separated from each other by interval of a <strong>Third</strong>.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Triads of a Major Scale:</strong></p>\n\n<p>Major Triads:</p>\n\n<p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">Tonic Triad - I</p>\n\n<p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">Subdominant Triad - IV</p>\n\n<p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">Dominant Triad - V</p>\n\n<p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">These 3 combined contain all the diatonic degrees of the scale, sound good together, are sufficient for harmonization of any melody that does not surpass the key in question.</p>\n\n<p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">Subdominant Triad,&nbsp;Dominant Triad are also <strong><em>tonic</em></strong>&nbsp; in those keys which are nearest to the given key in Circle Of Fifths.</p>\n\n<p>Minor Triads:</p>\n\n<p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">on II, III and VI degrees of scale.</p>\n\n<p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">The <strong>Minor Third</strong> interval in these triads impart a soft, weakened character, which can be used as a contrast to highlight the strenght of a Major triad. Their mutual affinity is same as that of major triads as they possess same proximity in Circle of Fifths.</p>\n\n<p>Can be grouped as:</p>\n\n<p><strong>Tonic Group:</strong> Triads on 1st and 6th degrees.&nbsp; I, VI</p>\n\n<p><strong>Dominant Group:</strong> Triads on 5th and 3rd degrees. V, III</p>\n\n<p><strong>Subdominant Group:</strong> Triads on 4th and 2nd degrees. IV, II</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>Triads of a Minor Scale (only 4 consonant triads):</strong></p>\n\n<p>Major Triads: on V, VI</p>\n\n<p>Minor Triads: on I, IV</p>\n\n<p>In the II, III, VII we find Dissonant intervals - diminished or augmented fifths.</p>\n\n<p>Dim-V is related to triads II, IV, V degrees, still it can properly be connected only with the Dominant Triad (keeping commont tones in the same voice), as the connection with other two would call for a step of an augmented second, which is vry unpleasant.</p>\n\n<p>Dim-II can be connected with triads IV, V, VI. However, avoid concealed Octaves and Fifths, &amp; the step of the augmented second.</p>\n\n<p>Aug-III can be connected with the triads on I, V, VI. <strong><em>This is seldom used as diatonic chord, but often used as chromatic or altered chord.</em></strong></p>\n\n<p>Connecting triad V to a triad VI, the leading tone is led upwards (so, third on 6th is doubled) to avoid the <em>augmented second</em>. Connecting VI to V, the third on VI should be doubled in the same vein.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>Four Part Harmony/ Four-Voiced Writing:</strong></p>\n\n<p>Outer Voices: Highest (Soprano) &amp; Deepest (Bass).</p>\n\n<p>Inner Voices: Alto, Tenor</p>\n\n<p>Chord Positions:</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Triads on scale have some common tones: e.g. C(ceg) and G(gbd) have g in common.</p>\n\n<p><em><strong>It&#39;s good to keep the common tone in the same voice. </strong>Don&#39;t choose too high a position of Tonic triad at the start.</em></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>Voice Motions:</strong></p>\n\n<p>Parallel Motion: 2 voices progress in one and same direction. <strong><em>Avoid</em></strong><em><strong> Parallel Fifths and Parallel Octaves </strong>(they are not pleasing to ear generally)</em>. [Harmonic intervals 5 5, 8 8 (using parallel motion)] [ x 5, x 8 (x=any) are also displeasing unless there&#39;s a common tone in the same voice]</p>\n\n<p>Oblique Motion: 1 voice remains stationary.</p>\n\n<p>Contrary Motion: 2 voices progress in opposite direction.</p>\n\n<p><strong>How do we connect 2 triads having no external relationship (i.e. common tone)</strong></p>\n\n<p>Use contrary motion without proceeding in great steps (leaps).</p>\n\n<p>Make bass step to Second interval, and using contrary motion, lead other voices into the nearest interval of the following chord.</p>\n\n<p>Deviation from the rules allowed only if contrary motion can be employed in Bass.</p>\n\n<p><em>Dominant to Tonic progression in Soprano Voice:</em> Keep in mind that leading tone (Third of the dominant chord) wants to resolve <em><strong>upward half a tone</strong></em> into tonic. So it cannot move to 3rd downward, however in inner voices it&#39;s fine to do so.</p>\n\n<p><em>Tonic to Subdominant progression in Soprano Voice</em>: Same as above.</p>\n\n<p>Diminished Triad on 7th scale degree should be used carefully.</p>\n\n<p>If diminished triad appears b/w two related triads, common tones must remain in the same voice.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>Avoid Parallel Fifth and Parallel Octaves (except for some rare cases).</strong></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h2>Harmonising a Melody:</h2>\n\n<p>The notes of melody can be either harmony notes, or inessential notes - neighbor, passing, suspension.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>Composing Intro for Melody:</strong></p>\n\n<p>Take notes from melody, establish chords by putting more notes while following the rules to avoid dissonance.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Middle for Melody:</strong></p>\n\n<p>Take neighbor tones, build chords over them.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n", "authorId": 1, "subject": "hidden", "tags": [], "img": "", "summary": "string", "lastUpdated": "2022-04-12 13:26:01.649770"}
