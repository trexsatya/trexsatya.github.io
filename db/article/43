Dream, monsieur, cheap dream, a trip to the Indies! Those persons perfume themselves with spices. You go in, [16] they draw the curtains, and the navigation begins. The gods come down onto the naked bodies and the islands are set adrift, lost souls crowned with the <strong>tousled</strong> hair of palm trees in the wind. Try it.</p>\n\n<p>I am sure you would have admired the rightness of my tone, the appropriateness of my emotion, the persuasion and warmth, the restrained indignation of my speeches before the court.</p>\n\n<p>Furthermore, I was buoyed up by two sincere feelings: the satisfaction of being on the right side of the bar and an instinctive scorn for judges in general.</p>\n\n<p>The feeling of the law, the satisfaction of being right, the joy of self-esteem, cher monsieur, are powerful incentives for keeping us upright or keeping us moving forward. On the other hand, if you deprive men of them, you transform them into dogs frothing with rage. How many crimes committed merely because [19] their authors could not endure being wrong!</p>\n\n<p>I once knew a manufacturer who had a perfect wife, admired by all, and yet he deceived her. That man was literally furious to be in the wrong, to be blocked from receiving, or granting himself, a certificate of virtue. The more virtues his wife manifested, the more vexed he became. Eventually, living in the wrong became unbearable to him. What do you think he did then? He gave up deceiving her? Not at all. He killed her. That is how I entered into relations with him.</p>\n\n<p>And&mdash;this is even rarer&mdash;I never deigned to flatter any journalist to get him on my side, nor any civil servant whose friendship [20] might be useful to me.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>The avidity which in our society substitutes for ambition has always made me laugh.</p>\n\n<p>I enjoyed my own nature to the fullest, and we all know that there lies happiness, although, to soothe one another mutually, we occasionally pretend to condemn such joys as selfishness.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>From as far away as I could see a 9 Albert Camus  The Fall cane hesitating on the edge of a sidewalk, I would rush forward, sometimes only a second ahead of another charitable hand already outstretched, snatch the blind person from any solicitude but mine, and lead [21] him gently but firmly along the crosswalk among the traffic obstacles toward the refuge of the other sidewalk, where we would separate with a mutual emotion.</p>\n\n<p>also liked&mdash;and this is harder to say&mdash;I liked to give alms. A very Christian friend of mine admitted that one&rsquo;s initial feeling on seeing a beggar approach one&rsquo;s house is unpleasant.</p>\n\n<p>Giving up my seat in the theater to allow a couple to sit together, hoisting a girl&rsquo;s suitcases onto the rack in a train&mdash;these were all deeds I performed more often than others because I paid more attention to the opportunities and was better able to relish the pleasure they give.</p>\n\n<p>At every hour of the day, within myself and among others, I would scale the heights and light conspicuous fires, and a joyful greeting would rise toward me.</p>\n\n<p>After all, living aloft is still the only way of being seen and hailed by the largest number.</p>\n\n<p>Indeed, wasn&rsquo;t that Eden, cher monsieur: no intermediary between life and me? Such was my life. I never had to learn how to live. In that regard, I already knew everything at birth. Some people&rsquo;s problem is to protect themselves from men or at least to come to terms with them. In my case, the understanding was already established. Familiar when it was appropriate, silent when necessary, capable of a free and easy manner as readily as of dignity, I was always in harmony.</p>\n\n<p>But just imagine, I beg you, a man at the height of his powers, in perfect health, generously gifted, skilled in bodily exercises as in those of the mind, neither rich nor poor, sleeping well, [28] and fundamentally pleased with himself without showing this otherwise than by a felicitous sociability. You will readily see how I can speak, without immodesty, of a successful life.</p>\n\n<p>Anyway, I am perhaps exaggerating. I was at ease in everything, to be sure, but at the same time satisfied with nothing.</p>\n\n<p>Have you never suddenly needed understanding, help, friendship? Yes, of course. I have learned to be satisfied with understanding. It is found more readily and, besides, it&rsquo;s not binding. &ldquo;I beg you to believe [31] in my sympathetic understanding&rdquo; in the inner discourse always precedes immediately &ldquo;and now, let&rsquo;s turn to other matters.&rdquo; It&rsquo;s a board chairman&rsquo;s emotion; it comes cheap, after catastrophes.</p>\n\n<p>But it&rsquo;s not easy, for friendship is absent-minded or at least unavailing. It is incapable of achieving what it wants. Maybe, after all, it doesn&rsquo;t want it enough? Maybe we don&rsquo;t love life enough? Have you noticed that death alone awakens our feelings? How we love the friends who have just left us? How&nbsp;But it&rsquo;s not easy, for friendship is absent-minded or at least unavailing. It is incapable of achieving what it wants. Maybe, after all, it doesn&rsquo;t want it enough? Maybe we don&rsquo;t love life enough? Have you noticed that death alone awakens our feelings? How we love the friends who have just left us?&nbsp;How we admire those of our teachers who have ceased to speak, their mouths filled with earth!</p>\n\n<p>That&rsquo;s the way man is, cher monsieur. He has two faces: he can&rsquo;t love without self-love.</p>\n\n<p>At once they awake, bestir themselves, get the details, commiserate.They need tragedy, don&rsquo;t you know; it&rsquo;s their little transcendence, their ap&eacute;ritif.</p>\n\n<p>They need tragedy, don&rsquo;t you know; it&rsquo;s their little transcendence, their ap&eacute;ritif. Moreover, is it mere chance that I should speak of a concierge? I had one, really ill favored, malice incarnate, a monster of insignificance and rancor, who would have discouraged a Franciscan.</p>\n\n<p>Something must happen&mdash;and that explains most human commitments. Something must happen, even loveless slavery, even war or death.</p>\n\n<p>I am well aware that one can&rsquo;t get along without domineering or being served. Every man needs slaves as he needs fresh air. Commanding is breathing&mdash;you agree with me? And even the most destitute manage to breathe. The lowest man in the social scale still has his wife or his child. If he&rsquo;s unmarried, a dog. The essential thing, after all, is being able to get angry with someone who has no [45] right to talk back. &ldquo;One doesn&rsquo;t talk back to one&rsquo;s father&rdquo;&mdash;you know the expression? In one way it is very odd. To whom should one talk back in this world if not to what one loves? In another way, it is convincing. Somebody has to have the last word. Otherwise, every reason can be answered with another one and there would never be an end to it. Power, on the other hand, settles everything.</p>\n\n<p>I have to admit it humbly, mon cher compatriote, I was always bursting with vanity. I, I, I is the refrain of my whole life, which could be heard in everything I said. I could never talk without boasting, especially if I did so with that shattering discretion that was my specialty.</p>\n\n<p>Even in the fields in which it was easy for me to verify my inferiority&mdash;like tennis, for instance, in which I was but a passable partner&mdash;it was hard for me not to think that, with a little time for practice, I would surpass the best players.</p>\n\n<p>From day to day women, from day to day virtue or vice, from day to day, like dogs&mdash;but every day myself secure at my post. Thus I progressed on the surface of life, in the realm of words as it were, never in reality. All those books barely read, those friends barely loved, those cities barely visited, those women barely possessed! I went through the gestures out of boredom or absentmindedness. Then came human beings; they wanted to cling, but there was nothing to cling to, and that was unfortunate&mdash;for them. As for me, I forgot. I never remembered anything but myself.</p>\n\n<p>As an afterthought I clearly saw what I should have done. I saw myself felling d&rsquo;Artagnan with a good hook to the jaw, getting back into my car, pursuing the monkey who had struck me, overtaking him, jamming his machine against the curb, taking him aside, and giving him the licking he had fully deserved. With a few variants, I ran off this little film a hundred times in my imagination. But it was too late, and for several days I chewed a bitter resentment.</p>\n\n<p>The truth is that every intelligent man, as you know, dreams of being a gangster and of ruling over society by force alone.</p>\n\n<p>You know what charm is: a [57] way of getting the answer yes without having asked any clear question.</p>\n\n<p>Indeed&mdash; especially for a ten-minute adventure and even more so if I were sure it was to have no sequel. I had principles, to be sure, such as that the wife of a friend is sacred. [59] But I simply ceased quite sincerely, a few days before, to feel any friendship for the husband.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>It hurts me to confess it, but I&rsquo;d have given ten conversations with [6o] Einstein for an initial rendezvous with a pretty chorus girl.</p>\n\n<p>In short, I was never concerned with the major problems except in the intervals between my little excesses.</p>\n\n<p>For instance, the scene of the incomprehensible attraction, of the &ldquo;mysterious something,&rdquo; of the &ldquo;it&rsquo;s unreasonable, I certainly didn&rsquo;t want to be attracted, I was even tired of love, etc. &hellip;&rdquo; always worked, though it is one of the oldest in the repertory.</p>\n\n<p>To them, at least, I did not lie much. Instinct spoke clearly, without subterfuges, in my attitude.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>b&ecirc;te noire</p>\n\n<p>/bɛt ˈnwɑː,beɪt ˈnwɑː,French bɛt nwaʀ/</p>\n\n<p><i>noun</i></p>\n\n<ol>\n\t<li jsname=\"gskXhf\">\n\t<p>a person or thing that one particularly dislikes.</p>\n\n\t<p>&quot;great-uncle Edward was my father&#39;s b&ecirc;te noire&quot;</p>\n\n\t<table>\n\t\t<tbody>\n\t\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t\t<td>&nbsp;</td>\n\t\t\t\t<td>&nbsp;</td>\n\t\t\t\t<td>&nbsp;</td>\n\t\t\t</tr>\n\t\t</tbody>\n\t</table>\n\n\t<p>Similar:</p>\n\n\t<p>bugbear</p>\n\n\t<p>pet hate</p>\n\n\t<p>pet aversion</p>\n\n\t<p>anathema</p>\n\n\t<p>abomination</p>\n\n\t<p>bogey</p>\n\n\t<p>bugaboo</p>\n\n\t<p>a thorn in one&#39;s flesh/side</p>\n\n\t<p>the bane of one&#39;s life</p>\n\t</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n","authorId":null,"subject":"pdev","tags":["andrewng"],"img":null,"summary":null,"lastUpdated":null}
