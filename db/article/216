{"name": "Krishnamurti's Philosophy", "id": 216, "content": "<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<div class=\"box1\">\n<ul>\n\t<li>What is me? What are its contents? How did it become me?</li>\n\t<li>What is security? what is suffering? Why do I identify myself with anything at all - family, nation, religion etc?</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n\n<p><br />\nAnd so, it seems to me that it is very important to understand this nature of contradiction: the contradiction between the word and the act, the contradiction between the conscious demands, urges, pursuits, and the unconscious hidden demands, secret desires and pursuits.</p>\n\n<p>And to be free is to be aware of the contradiction - perhaps most of us are not aware of it even, we just carry on. And when we do become aware of this extraordinary contradiction not only outwardly but very deeply, and we find no solution for it, no answer, no freedom from it, we either turn to so-called god - that is the whole structure of belief, dogma, ritual, authority, which is generally called religion - or take life and give it no significance at all, which is what most modern writers are trying to do. They have denied the whole structure of the church, which any intelligent man must deny, for it has no meaning whatsoever; and then they&#39;re forced to face their own contradiction - their hates, their despairs, their hopes, their utter helplessness. And so they say, there is only this life, it has no meaning, let&#39;s make the best of it, and the philosophy of despair.</p>\n\n<p>And if one observes the nature of will, will itself is a form of resistance, and therefore will in itself inherently is contradiction. So, is it possible at all, living in this world - carrying on with our office, family, the whole business of modern life - is it at all possible to live without any contradiction whatsoever and therefore act in the very outcome of that state of non-contradiction, in which there is no contradiction whatsoever at any level of one&#39;s being, outwardly or within the skin, is it possible to have no contradiction and therefore act, which is the outcome of energy, the acting itself is energy.</p>\n\n<p>If one has observed oneself, one sees the more active physically one is there is more energy. It is not the other way round, that you must have energy to act. On the contrary the more you act the more energy there is, biologically as well as psychologically. So, to come upon this action which breeds energy. Which is, the very action is energy, it&#39;s not action and then energy, or energy and then action. It&#39;s not the idea, and action. The idea is never... does never give energy. It gives a stimulation, a momentary enthusiasm. But it is the action which brings about energy or the energy from which the action derives.</p>\n\n<p>The root of contradiction is the division between the thinker and the thought. For most of us there is this wide gap between the observer and the observed, the thinker and the thought, or the centre which experiences and the thing which is experienced. There are two, there is an interval, a gap, a time lag. There is a contradiction - that is the real source of contradiction.</p>\n\n<p>And the two cannot be integrated. But if one observes what the structure of the thinker, you will see the thinker is not, when thought is not. It is the thought that breeds the thinker, the experiencer, the entity that creates time, and the entity who is the source of fear.</p>\n\n<p>Because most of us have many forms of fear. Please watch your own fear as we are talking about it, deeply inside, your own secret fears. And obviously there is the obvious, there is the ultimate fear of death. And being afraid we try to escape from death through belief, through the ideas of resurrection and reincarnation and so on and on and on. Either you rationalise death or you have a belief. Both rationalisation of death and a belief are both an avoidance of death, an escape, and therefore that creates contradiction. We say death is something opposite to living. So to understand death we must understand life.</p>\n\n<p>So one must examine what our life is. What is our life, as it is actually, not theoretically, not hypothetically, what it should be, but actually what is it? A series of memories, experiences of misery, of pain, despairs, agony, longing, loneliness, the aches and the turmoil of good and the bad, the health and disease - we are that; that is what we call life. That&#39;s all we know. And the battle in that field, what we call life - endless conflict, endless misery and confusion. And I am not exaggerating: this is actual fact. And we don&#39;t know how to solve it, how to understand it, how to go beyond this misery, how to end sorrow. So not knowing, we either escape through religion or through the assertion that life has no meaning at all whatsoever, no significance, and just let&#39;s live for the day. So one has to understand life totally, that is, to free oneself from all this misery. And it is possible. Then life... living is not different from dying. Then there is not this gap, the wide interval of time created by the thinker, and therefore the thinker breeding fear. And so, when we understand what living is, which is to live dying to all the misery every day, or to all the problems, to all the pleasures, without argument. That&#39;s what is going to happen when you die. You die without argument - you can&#39;t discuss with death.</p>\n\n<p>So to die to sorrow. And we do not die to sorrow because we do not know what real joy is, and we do not know or capacity or the understanding how to end sorrow, therefore we&#39;d rather have sorrow, with all the self-pity, commiseration and so on, so on, so on, rather than enter into something I don&#39;t know.</p>\n\n<p>And when there is no contradiction, that is, when the observer is no longer acting as a censor - you know what I mean by the word &#39;censor&#39; - who condemns, who denies, who says this is right and wrong, this is good and bad. Which doesn&#39;t mean that you live a most superficial life. On the contrary, to come to that point you have to understand the whole conditioning. Then we will see that when there is no censor - which is not an assertion, one has to understand this, one has to work at it - then you will see that the mind becomes merely an observer. But that mind now is no longer in a state of contradiction and therefore has tremendous energy.</p>\n\n<p>So, that energy is what we call love, which is passionate; not merely physical passion - that&#39;s fairly easy, that&#39;s fairly common, that everybody knows, lust - but what we are talking about is the passion which has no cause and therefore no contradiction, no motive and therefore no end. And where there is love there is also death. The two cannot be separate, because love has no ambition. Please, I am stating these things, that has no value for you; it has only value, it has meaning actually when this contradiction totally comes to an end. Because love and death must be, for creation to be.</p>\n\n<p>Now, as I said, the mind when it is not touched or has understood the whole structure of contradiction, conscious as well as unconscious, it is completely still. Because any movement of energy is a dissipation. It&#39;s only when the mind is completely still, with tremendous energy, then there is an explosion, and that explosion is creation, which may or may not need expression.</p>\n\n<p>Now, to understand all this is self-knowing. Self-knowing is not something extraordinary - this is what is going on - I am in misery, I am in despair, anxious - don&#39;t you know all these things? - frustrated, and I put there is a tomorrow through which I am escaping from &#39;what is&#39;. I have been healthy and I am not healthy today, I am ill. So my mind goes back to the state... remembering to the state which I called health and says, &#39;I wish I could be healthy again&#39;. So there is a strain, there is an effort - the pressure of the past remembrance. But if you did not bring the past remembrances, but see actually that you are ill, and be ill; not let thought interfere with it, not let thought interfere with its memories of how good it was when I was healthy. So if thought doesn&#39;t interfere with the organism, the organism itself then has its own curative powers.</p>\n\n<p>What is action for us, most of us? Action is based on an idea, based on comparative values. Action - &#39;I should do this&#39;. So, the action we know now is a contradiction between idea and the act. Right? That&#39;s clear, isn&#39;t it - I don&#39;t have to go into detail, there&#39;s no time - but that is what is actually taking place. I have an idea brought about through experience, through understanding... not through - through knowledge, information, and the fears and the escapes. And the idea comes, and according to that idea or approximating my action to that idea is action. That&#39;s all we know. Now, action without idea, which means action which does not create contradiction, action which is not the result of contradiction - to understand the nature of that is part of meditation.</p>\n\n<p>In the East it is a very familiar word, and being very familiar it is very traditional. It is a thing that you conform, you discipline, you control, you shape your thought according to a pattern. There are a set of rules - the way you sit, the way you breathe, the way you do - there is a system of meditation, and if you follow that system they say you will get results. Of course you will get results - that&#39;s fairly clear, isn&#39;t it. If I do something over and over and over and over again, day after day, month after month, I will get a result. But the result is a projected result of a mind that is petty, small, stupid. It is conforming to the pattern, therefore there is no freedom, and therefore such meditation is no meditation at all. It is merely a conformity to a pattern through which you hope to achieve peace, god and everything else. A petty little mind - you know this bourgeois, small, frustrated mind sits down to meditate and practices discipline and control and shapes activity - will remain always petty, and its gods will be petty. But when once you see that, you deny the whole of that system. In the very denial of it, in the very rejecting of it, you are free from this old idea that you must conform to what has been established.</p>\n\n<p>So you are free, enormously free. And then only, when there is no contradiction in action - not the idea of action - and when there is no conformity of the pattern which has been established by gurus, saints and all the half... (laughter) ...people, then when you are free of all that, because you understand it, then you begin to meditate. Because meditation is one of the most marvellous things if you know how to do it. Not &#39;how&#39; - if you do it. Because meditation means not only the total understanding of the self, and therefore freedom from the psychological structure of society. Which means you are no longer ambitious, greedy, envious, trying to achieve, trying to become, and therefore no effort, therefore the mind is completely still, not made still by discipline, control, breathing, and all the rest of those stupid little tricks. Or by drugs. Then the mind becomes extraordinarily active and quiet. And to be active and quiet the mind must be silent and therefore full of energy and empty.</p>\n\n<p>But you see, most of us want experience. That&#39;s why people try to meditate. They have had all the physical, intellectual, emotional experiences, and they want more, more, so they take drugs - and there are several drugs on the market to give you a stimulus. And that is to have more experience. Now, one has to understand the nature of experience. If you had no experience you would go to sleep. If there was not pressure, pushed, being pushed all round by society, by books, by every form of influence, you would go to sleep immediately, because that&#39;s what we want - safety, comfort, security. And having all had that kind of experience, and being fed up with it, bored with that kind of experience if you are at all very clever, fairly sensitive and subtle, you want wider, deeper experience. But it is the same movement.</p>\n\n<p>So, when you understand this whole nature of experience, you are free from the outward stimulus which gives you experiences. Then if you also reject that, then you have the challenge inwardly, which creates its own experiences. That is, in meditation people see visions, and love to see all these childish things, which are fairly... which is the result of our own conditioning. And also when you have understood all that, when there is an understanding of all that, then there is, when the mind is so still and quiet, there is no experiencing at all. Because when such a mind is alive, a light to itself, clear, it is beyond all experience, and therefore totally awake. And all that is meditation.</p>\n\n<p>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3GLwXLr_Q8E</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>The future of the humanity:</p>\n\n<p>The world has become tremendously dangerous with all the wars, terrorism, some dictators trying to destroy the world, economic crisis, ecological crisis, national divisions, racial divisions, religious separation, unemployment etc<br />\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[Has it? Or, has the world become better?]</p>\n\n<p>A person has to make a living. There are very limited jobs now..</p>\n\n<p>What would you do?<br />\nForget myself, my needs, needs of people around me, and think bigger..</p>\n\n<p>I don&#39;t think there&#39;s psychological evolution at all...<br />\nThere&#39;s physical evolution of course. But is there a psychological tomorrow or yesterday?<br />\nWhy not? I can remember yesterday, anticipate tomorrow..<br />\nWhat is the psyche, the me, the ego? Will the me ever evolve, transcend? Can we do it in time? - No.<br />\nWhy not?<br />\nWhat is me?<br />\nThe whole structure of me (my consciousness, experiences, memories etc) is put together by thought.<br />\nBut the first impression that we get is that the &#39;me&#39; is independent, and the &#39;me&#39; is thinking. But you are saying that the &#39;me&#39; is not thinking, &#39;me&#39; is the product of &#39;thought&#39;?<br />\nIt doesn&#39;t seem like we are talking about the same &#39;thought&#39; that we know of, the intellectual thought?<br />\nNo, the &#39;thought&#39; is the whole movement of consciousness, memories, intellectual thoughts etc.<br />\nBut some people would say, I AM my consciousness, because if I&#39;m not conscious I&#39;m not here.<br />\nConsciousness if made of what it has gathered and remembered. If all this absent there&#39;ll be no consciousness as we know it (there would be one of a different kind).<br />\nSo, is there a future of this sort of consciousness because it will just repeat the same pattern, so, is there any evolution of it?<br />\nSo are you saying that thought can only repeat itself? - Yes. But thought sometimes creates new ideas as well.<br />\nThought is limited, because knowledge is limited.<br />\nWhy do you say that?<br />\nThe knowledge which is born of eperience is limited. I&#39;m talking about the laws of human beings, not the laws of nature, which we hope that we can find one day.<br />\nSo, man can never acquire the complete knowledge of the psyche, there&#39;s always unknown?<br />\nYes. Because thought is dependent on knowledge, psyche is dependent on thought, hence the psyche has no evolution.<br />\nEven in scientific discoveries, there&#39;s always the unknown.<br />\nThe limitation of thought has brough serious issues in the world e.g totalitarian ideals. Whatever action is born of limited thought must bring conflict. The division of humanity is result of the limited thought. - How?</p>\n\n<p>Aren&#39;t we seeking security?<br />\nThe thought thinks this will bring me security, that will bring me security, so it creates divisive schemes like nation, religion, race etc. But in this very mode of seeking security it creates insecurity and instability.<br />\nOnce you see that, not just intellectually but really feel that I am no different from the rest of the humanity, the responsibility becomes immense.<br />\nIf you leave aside the superficial things like qualities in which people make distinctions, the whole humanity is same in terms of basic things which are fear, sorrow, pain, anxiety, loneliness.<br />\nBut most would say that our highest achievements are not these basic things. [So what if they are basic things, there are things on top of it]</p>\n\n<p>But what have we achieved psychologically? Nothing.<br />\nThought is separative in its own nature. That&#39;s why we were conditioned into thinking that we are individuals and not one whole psychically.</p>\n\n<p>But even though we are all similar, it doesn&#39;t mean we are all one. People extrapolate from body to mind, we do have separate individuality in terms of body, then why not mind and consciousness?<br />\n...<br />\n[No logical answer from Krishnamurthi]<br />\nIf we are one inseparable whole, why do we feel separate in the first place?<br />\nI think it&#39;s in the nature of thought..<br />\nSource of thought is memory which is knowledge, knowledge which is outcome of eperience, and experience is always limited. As we were saying &#39;thought is time&#39;<br />\nHow is thought time? Everything takes time, to think takes time, but it doesn&#39;t mean that thought IS time.<br />\nWould you say that thought is movement, and time is movement?<br />\nTime requires movement, but to say time is movement is not clear.<br />\nHope is time, becoming is time, achieving is time..psychologically.<br />\nWhen you are violent, there is no non-violence. We want to become non-violent, that&#39;s in the framework of time..<br />\nYou see becoming is also an extension of material observations.. right now there&#39;s desert, no garden..but with time it can become a garden.. So, why not psychically we can &#39;become&#39;?<br />\nBecause when you are violent, that&#39;s the only state of mind. The other one of non-violence is illusory. So, all psychological ideals are illusory.<br />\n[But we do have not one, but many mental states. It could be true that at a moment we are in only one state.. but on a different moment we might be in different mental state, and memory holds on to that, and intellectual capacity can analyse that and think in terms of &#39;becoming&#39;]<br />\n[Then. how does the change, &#39;becoming&#39; happen? Is it because of faith?]</p>\n\n<p>When you say, &quot;I need time to become good, I need time to be enlightened&quot;, it creates conflict between the observer and the observed. The observer and the observed are the same. Therefore there&#39;s no time psychologically.</p>\n\n<p>Most people live in the state of conflict because of this.<br />\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[It also means that the psychopaths who do not have any conflict between good and bad, are completely at peace]</p>\n\n<p>Time is divisive, thought is also divisive. Henc, thought is time, or time is thought.<br />\nIt doesn&#39;t follow logically. Even if there are similar, it doesn&#39;t mean one is the other.<br />\nThought is a movement (of becoming), time is also movement. Hence thought is time.<br />\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[But it still doesn&#39;t follow logically]<br />\nWhat do you mean by psychological movement? what is moving?<br />\nI am this, and I am wanting/trying to become that. That is movement of contents of thought.</p>\n\n<p>Is it possible to perceive something, without the thoughts, memory etc, perceive the &#39;me&#39; in its entirety with all its contents of consciousness?<br />\nCan man live without conflict?</p>\n\n<p>When we operate from memory, we are not different from computers.</p>\n\n<p>There&#39;s an intelligence which even though it acts through memory and knowledge, it is not dependent on memory and knowledge.</p>\n\n<p>How do you find out that is a reality, not an imagination, or romanticisation? To find that out you have to go into the whole question of suffering..</p>\n\n<p>Suffering is a shock, my suffering is different from your suffering, this creates an illusion. We don&#39;t see that suffering is shared by all humanity, it is the basis of existence.</p>\n\n<p>The world is not separable from me. If you really feel that, not just say verbally, that&#39;s real meditation.</p>\n\n<p>What remains when you end suffering? Love and compassion.</p>\n\n<p>So, what is the future of mankind? With all these problems of war, hatred, overpopulation, ecological decay etc? Nobody seems to care.<br />\nSome people do care, while others are immersed in their own little problems, some feel a despair that it can&#39;t be solved.<br />\nAnd those who think that it should be solved, they form their own little groups, own theories etc..</p>\n\n<p>What&#39;s the point of you and I agreeing, seeing something true. Those in power won&#39;t even listen to you.<br />\nThen what is my responsibility?<br />\nHow does one make another see all this? They don&#39;t have time, energy, they haven&#39;t even the inclination, they want to be amused.</p>\n\n<p>Source: https://youtu.be/CvL4uNA4U-k?list=PLWVoG8Cll6HWUduNSwEvnTIfgnhnQBT4f</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n", "authorId": 1, "subject": "philosophy", "tags": [""], "img": "https://k12.thoughtfullearning.com/sites/k12/files/minilesson/images/shutterstock_123605941.jpg", "summary": "", "lastUpdated": "2021-09-12 15:42:29.995680"}
