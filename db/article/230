{"name": "Logical Arguments and Fallacies", "id": 230, "content": "<style type=\"text/css\">.example {\n     color: blue;\n   }\n</style>\n<div class=\"box1\">\n<p>Why do you believe anything?&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Sometimes, what you believe is just an intuition. Other times, it&#39;s your mind taking logical steps, making <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inference\" target=\"_blank\">inferences</a> and so on. Whatever the reason, your mind always has some sort of&nbsp;justification, a story for every belief that you have. (Even intuition appears to be <em>&mdash;</em>&nbsp;on deep analysis <em>&mdash;</em>&nbsp;just a concoction of logical reasoning, story making, emotions, subjective experiences etc)&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>There are basically three types of procedures that logical part of our minds uses to understand (/assume) reality: Deduction, Induction, Abduction.</p>\n</div>\n\n<h2>&nbsp;</h2>\n\n<h2><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deductive_reasoning\" target=\"_blank\">Deduction</a></h2>\n\n<p>When you say (or think), &quot;Ohh!! It means that.... &quot;. Or, &quot; It has to be true because.... &quot;, you are doing <em>deduction</em>.</p>\n\n<p>Formally,&nbsp;<span class=\"math\">\\text{ If } P\\text{ then } Q</span> statements. Or, <span class=\"math\">P\\text{ implies }Q</span> i.e. <span class=\"math\">P\\implies Q</span></p>\n\n<p>If &nbsp;<span class=\"math\">P</span> is not satisfied (i.e. it is not True), then it does not matter what <span class=\"math\">Q</span> is; might as well be considered True.</p>\n\n<p>But you cannot assert that &nbsp;<span class=\"math\">\\text{If not }P \\text{ then not }Q</span>, that is a fallacy <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denying_the_antecedent\" target=\"_blank\">Denying the antecedent</a>. Why? &mdash; Because, it is possible that if not this, something else implies the same thing.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><em>(Note: It is possible that in some instances this deduction holds true, but it does not mean that it will apply everywhere)</em></p>\n\n<p>Also, from the statement &nbsp;<span class=\"math\">\\text{If } P \\text{ then } Q</span>, it is wrong to say that&nbsp; <span class=\"math\">\\text{If }Q\\text{ then }P</span>, that is another fallacy, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affirming_the_consequent\" target=\"_blank\">Affirming the Consequent</a>. Why? &mdash; Because, maybe something else also implies the same thing. Q could have been true not because of P, but something else.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modus_tollens\" target=\"_blank\"><i><strong>Modus Tollens</strong></i><strong> </strong>(Denying the Consequent)</a><strong>:</strong><i> </i>However, from the statement &nbsp;<span class=\"math\">\\text{If } P \\text{ then } Q</span>, we can infer that &nbsp;<span class=\"math\">\\text{If not }Q,\\text{ then not }P</span> (Because, if &nbsp;<span class=\"math\">P</span> was True, <span class=\"math\">Q</span> would have been True as well)</p>\n\n<p>Also note that an argument may be <em>valid</em>, but still not be <strong><em>sound</em></strong>. If an argument is not sound, it is useless. For an argument to be sound, both (or all) the premises of the argument have to be True. E.g. In the above example, both <span class=\"math\">P</span> and <span class=\"math\">Q</span> have to be true for the argument to be sound.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Let&#39;s say, your friend told you yesterday, &quot;<i>I promise that if I am healthy, I will come to class&quot;</i>. But he did not come to class. And you draw conclusion that &quot;<em>Your friend is not healthy</em>&quot;.</p>\n\n<p>In the&nbsp;logical part of your mind, you had something like this:-</p>\n\n<p><span class=\"math\">P = \\text{Your friend is healthy}</span>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><span class=\"math\">Q = \\text{He will come to class}</span>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;and&nbsp;<span class=\"math\">P\\implies Q</span></p>\n\n<p>You can take any two of these three as <strong><em>Premises</em></strong>, and draw a <strong><em>Conclusion</em></strong> for the third one. And, as long as the Premises are true, your conclusion is guaranteed to be true as well.</p>\n\n<p>Notice that it will be a wrong argument to say that &quot;If your friend is not healthy, then he will not come to class&quot; i.e.&nbsp;<span class=\"math\">\\text{ If not}\\text~ P \\text{ then not}\\text~ Q</span>&nbsp;&mdash; That&#39;s Denying the Antecedent fallacy. Also, you cannot say that, &quot;My friend has come to the class, he must be healthy&quot; &mdash; That&#39;s Affirming the Consequent fallacy.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>But, how did&nbsp;you&nbsp;come to believe that&nbsp;<span class=\"math\">P \\implies Q</span>&nbsp;?</p>\n\n<p>Based on induction. See below.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h2><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inductive_reasoning\" target=\"_blank\">Induction</a></h2>\n\n<p>Works on the basis of examples, observations. If all the examples that we have seen so far verify that <span class=\"math\">A</span> is true, then it is very good reason to <strong><em>accept</em></strong> that A will always be&nbsp;true, however it does not prove it.</p>\n\n<p>In the above example when your friend says, &quot;<em>I promise that if I am healthy, I will come to class</em>&quot;. And you believe that he will come to class if he is healthy. Why? &mdash; Because he has always kept his promise in the past. That&#39;s <strong><em>induction</em></strong>.</p>\n\n<p>Another example, &quot;there will always come a day after a night&quot;. Why? &mdash; Because, that&#39;s how it has been so far.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Another one, &quot;nothing will last forever&quot;. Why? &mdash; Because, nothing has done so far.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong><em>Basically, induction is about getting a general idea/theory from specific individual examples.</em></strong></p>\n\n<p>Sometimes, we believe some things based on induction (generalization of examples), but not 100%. Instead, we say &quot;It is <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability\" target=\"_blank\"><strong><em>probably</em></strong></a> true, because that&#39;s how it has been so far.. &quot; <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics\" target=\"_blank\">Statistical</a> tools can tell us how much probable is it that it&#39;s true.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/common_logic.jpg\" style=\"width: 100%;\" /></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Notice the difference between Deduction and Induction:-</p>\n\n<p>In Deduction, if the Premises are guaranteed to be true, the Conclusion has to be true at any cost. <em><strong>However, a Premise can be guaranteed to be true only in some formal systems like mathematics, or a highly structured unambiguous language.</strong></em>&nbsp;For example, if there&#39;re two people in a room, and I see two new people enter the room, I can correctly deduce that there are four people in the room.&nbsp; In fact, even mathematical system can lead to contradictions. See <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G%C3%B6del's_incompleteness_theorems\" target=\"_blank\">G&ouml;del&#39;s incompleteness theorems</a>&nbsp;which means that even mathematical deductions may be further from truth in general. In fact, it seems that it is impossible to know the truth with logic and reasoning:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M%C3%BCnchhausen_trilemma\">M&uuml;nchhausen trilemma</a></p>\n\n<p>In real world though, the guarantee of the Premises (the statements which are used to make some conclusion) themselves is assumed based on Induction. Or, sometimes the Premises are simply assumed.</p>\n\n<p>In Induction, you take the Premises in form of examples, and draw a Conclusion without any guarantee.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Note: When we say&nbsp;<span class=\"math\">P \\implies Q</span>&nbsp;based on induction, it does not mean that <span class=\"math\">P</span> <strong>causes</strong> <span class=\"math\">Q</span>&nbsp;. It just means that so far what we have seen, whenver we find that <span class=\"math\">P</span> is true, <span class=\"math\">Q</span> is also true. Hence we establish <span class=\"math\">Q</span> will <em><strong>always</strong></em> be true <em>if</em> <span class=\"math\">P</span> is true.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Hume&#39;s Uniformity Principle: What justification do we have that future will conform to the past? (It&#39;s not self-evident, it&#39;s not demonstratively true [deductive argument], Sensory knowledge is not enough, ...)</p>\n\n<p>- It is rational by definition, by success rate. [because otherwise it would be irrational e.g. consulting an astrologist despite huge number of mispredictions]. It&#39;s practical, but not epistemic.</p>\n\n<p>- Probabilistic Argument: That the probability of being wrong for inductive statements is very low. E.g. That the sun will not rise tomorrow. It will be true, until it becomes false once and for all. <em>[But, does it really become false for once and all?]</em></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h2><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abductive_reasoning\" target=\"_blank\">Abduction</a></h2>\n\n<p>When you say, &quot;it is most likely that it&#39;s so and so..&quot;</p>\n\n<p>Abduce means selecting one (or some) of many possible explanations for an observation in the hope that it will help us orient ourselves better in our surroundings and disregard some possibilities. (<em>Best possible explanation, or Inference to the Best Explanation - IBE</em>)</p>\n\n<p><strong>But which one of the possible explanations to choose?</strong></p>\n\n<p>Criteria for picking out a member representing &quot;the best&quot; explanation include the <em>simplicity</em>, the <em>prior probability</em>, or the <em>explanatory power</em> of the explanation, or prior familiarity with idea.</p>\n\n<p>Another way to eliminate the possibility/theory is to see where the theory leads, if it leads to absurdities, contradictions, we eliminate it. For example, because considering material particles as fundamental building block leads to many absurdities, that&#39;s why some people consider a theory which is the reverse of it&nbsp;e.g. <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panpsychism\" target=\"_blank\">Panpsychism</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Lanza#Biocentrism\" target=\"_blank\">Biocentrism</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h2>Logical Reasoning in Science</h2>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Sanders_Peirce\" target=\"_blank\">Charles Sanders Peirce</a>:&nbsp;&ldquo;Deduction proves something must be. Induction shows that something actually is operative; abduction merely suggests that something may be&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>Earlier, methodology of science was said to be primarily based on inductive inferences. <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karl_Popper\" target=\"_blank\">Karl Popper</a> suggested that it is not so, generation of a new idea is not a logical thing and once the idea has been proposed one has to use Deductive Reasoning to see if the theory can be <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falsifiability\" target=\"_blank\">falsified</a>. However, this idea of falsification is also questionable.</p>\n\n<p>Abduction plays central role in generating new ideas/theories. It&#39;s not simply a guess, rather it&#39;s a feature of mind that past combines experiences, ideas with new observations/experiences to generate new ideas.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Later, it was expanded to include Inference to The Best Explanation (IBE) which is more about <em>justification</em> of an idea, rather than the <em>discovery</em> of ideas. It can be said that abduction is more of a creative imagination thing than logical procedure. Many discoveries in science and mathematics have appeared not through a well-defined logical procedure, instead by imagination.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Also, science never &quot;proves&quot; anything, it just validates a theory, a guess against experience. - <a href=\"https://youtu.be/EYPapE-3FRw\">Feynman</a></p>\n\n<p>Reference: <a href=\"https://www.creative-wisdom.com/teaching/WBI/abduction5.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">Creative-wisdom</a></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><em><strong>Probably everyone (who thinks) understands that we don&#39;t actually know (the ultimate) truth at any given moment, but the brain can&#39;t stand uncertainty, so it&#39;s not surprising that people take the assumptions, inductions, deductions to be truth.</strong></em> Moreover, there are other ways in which people dodge logical uncertainties, just to keep their brain at rest.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Probably that&#39;s why Zen Buddhists developed <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K%C5%8Dan\" target=\"_blank\">K\u014dans</a>, so that they can train themselves to live in uncertainty.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Many Forms of Logical Reasoning (that I need to explore more):-</p>\n\n<ol>\n\t<li><a href=\"https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/reasoning-defeasible/\" target=\"_blank\">Defeasible Reasoning</a></li>\n\t<li><a href=\"https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/logic-nonmonotonic/\" target=\"_blank\">Monotonic Logic</a></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h2>Logical Fallacies</h2>\n\n<p>Most of&nbsp;the logical fallacies occur because our mind shifts attention between <i>Abstract/General</i>&nbsp;and <em>Concrete/Specific</em> cases. (This same property of mind is also responsible for innovative ideas)</p>\n\n<p id=\"firstHeading\" lang=\"en\"><strong><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuum_fallacy\" target=\"_blank\">Continuum fallacy</a>:</strong></p>\n\n<p lang=\"en\">&quot;It is so vague, therefore it&#39;s not valid&quot;.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>Circular Reasoning (</strong><i><strong>Petitio Principii</strong> a.k.a Begging The Question)</i><strong>:</strong></p>\n\n<p>Rather than proving the statement, the statement itself is used to assert the implication.</p>\n\n<div class=\"example\">\n<p>E.g. Wind is invisible because no one can see it. No one can see it because wind is invisible. (<em>Where&#39;s the explanation that why wind is invisible or why I can&#39;t see it?</em>)</p>\n</div>\n\n<p>There are many sophisticated theories which fall prey to circular reasoning e.g. <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_energy_principle\" target=\"_blank\">Free Energy Principle</a></p>\n\n<p><strong>Hasty Generalization:</strong></p>\n\n<p>When we do not consider the context / situation, and assert that something is true in general.</p>\n\n<div class=\"example\">\n<p>E.g. If I see ten Bhutanese people who are happier, I make a conclusion that Bhutanese people are happier in general.</p>\n</div>\n\n<p>This is probably the most common fallacy among people. Sometimes, just one example which resonates with their cognition is enough for them to make generalization.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>Biased Sample:</strong></p>\n\n<p>That you take into account only a portion of the population which somehow does not represent the whole population&#39;s diversity.</p>\n\n<div class=\"example\">\n<p>E.g. Suppose, in a research you find that wealthy people are more anxious, generally more unhappy&nbsp;than others. But you do not take the diverse population from the segment of wealthy people. That is, you do not study different types of wealthy people, those who do charity, those who spend their fortune on gaining new experiences, those who use their wealth to spread joy, those who are somehow able to spend time with their family etc.</p>\n</div>\n\n<p><em>[Is this even a problem? In the above example, of course when we say &quot;wealthy people&quot; we do not mean all kinds of wealthy people, we generally avoid conextual informations and use common terms while in conversations. However, in research reports, everything should be thorough, and there it is definitely a fallacy to miss the boundaries; there it is wrong to just say &quot;wealthy people&quot;.]</em></p>\n\n<p><strong>Slippery Slope:</strong></p>\n\n<p>That one small step creates a chain of events that lead to some conclusive event eventually. <em>Basically you are making a story that seems to be logically coherent, but has many turning points.</em></p>\n\n<div class=\"example\">\n<p>E.g. If you don&#39;t study on weekends, your grades will suffer. If your grades suffer, you won&#39;t graduate school. If you don&#39;t graduate school, you won&#39;t get a job. If you don&#39;t get a job, you will become homeless. <em>So, basically If you don&#39;t study on Saturdays, you will eventually become homeless.</em></p>\n</div>\n\n<p>This assumes that there is only one path that an event can lead us to. And, that, all these events are linked perfectly.</p>\n\n<p>Notice however that <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Butterfly_effect\" target=\"_blank\">Butterfly Effect</a> theory tells us that this is indeed possible, doesn&#39;t mean that it has significant probability of happening in reality. However, the chain can break, in practice, at many levels.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Strawmanning:</strong></p>\n\n<p>That you twist/distort someone&#39;s statement (argument) in a way that is easy for you to rebut. <em>Basically you are not on the same page, you are not talking the exact same thing that someone has claimed.</em></p>\n\n<p><strong>Ad Hominem:</strong></p>\n\n<p>That you attack the person&#39;s character or person&#39;s attribute in order to discredit their argument. Basically you are not then talking about the argument itself, instead you start attacking the argument maker.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Tu quoque</strong> (You too a.k.a. Appeal To Hipocrisy): is a special case of Ad Hominem.<i> </i>The &quot;argument&quot; follows the pattern:</p>\n\n<ol>\n\t<li>Person A makes claim X.</li>\n\t<li>Person B asserts that A&#39;s actions or past claims are inconsistent with the truth of claim X.</li>\n\t<li>Therefore, X is false.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p><em>Basically you are not then discussing the claim itself, instead the claimer.</em></p>\n\n<p>Poisoning the Well:</p>\n\n<p>is somewhat related to the above two. <em>It is when you put forth many negative things about your opponent, so that his arguments would not be considered.</em></p>\n\n<div class=\"example\">\n<p>E.g. Your friend tells you that her brother wants to date you, but she says that he is a player and never keeps a girlfriend for very long. Now, when you meet him, your opinion will be tainted.</p>\n</div>\n\n<p><span>Guilt by Association: </span></p>\n\n<p><span>is <em>when you don&#39;t like or consider the argument because you don&#39;t like the person who put forth the argument, or you find that its associated&nbsp;with some event or person that you don&#39;t like.</em> </span></p>\n\n<div class=\"example\">\n<p><span>E.g.&nbsp;</span>You think that the nations should implement communist idea of shared wealth.&nbsp;If those who had more than enough were forced to share with those who did not have enough, things would be more fair and equal. Jordan thinks the government should take over businesses and industry to make things more fair. Then you&nbsp;learn&nbsp;that communist leaders, like Stalin and the current regime in China support shared wealth and state-owned industry. You decide&nbsp;that&nbsp;you don&#39;t&nbsp;really believe that anymore.&nbsp;</p>\n</div>\n\n<p><em>Just because you saw bad examples, bad implementations?&nbsp;</em></p>\n\n<p><strong>False Dichotomy (a.k.a. False Dilemma)/ Categorical Thinking:</strong></p>\n\n<p>That you discredit other possibilities of an argument and pick only two points that work in your favour. You assume that <strong>&quot;either <em>this</em> is true or <em>that</em> is true&quot;</strong>. <em>Basically you have limited your perception, and scope. You also think that the distinctions that you have established in your mind are mutually exclusive.</em></p>\n\n<div class=\"example\">\n<p>E.g. if I say something against a political party, you automatically assume that I favour the opposition party.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"example\">\n<p>E.g. &quot;I thought you were a good person, but you didn&#39;t donate to the charity last year.&quot; <em>(So what? I am not a good person because of that? Did you consider other possibilities?)</em></p>\n</div>\n\n<p>This is one of the most common fallacies. People often think in limited scope and possibilities. And it makes sense, nobody can think of all the possibilities, and it is highly exhausting to enlarge the scope and think of many possibilities.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Appeal to Emotion:</strong></p>\n\n<p>That you assert some statement just because it&#39;s favoured generally. Or that it has emotional appeal. <em>&quot;You know, just because people like it&quot;</em>.</p>\n\n<div class=\"example\">\n<p>E.g. If it was not true, people would feel sad.</p>\n</div>\n\n<p><strong>Equivocation (DoubleSpeak):</strong></p>\n\n<p>That you are not making a clear assertion. You are ambiguous, double-sided. <em>Basically you are doing <strong>wordplay</strong> rather than rationalization.</em></p>\n\n<div class=\"example\">\n<p>E.g. &quot;Alcohol is&nbsp;better than nothing. Nothing is better than milk. Hence Alcohol is better than milk.&quot; The problem here is that the word &#39;nothing&#39; in both the sentences has different meanings (nothing = <em>not anything, </em>nothing = all things).&nbsp; In fact, the second sentence can be rewritten as &quot;Milk is better than anything&quot;</p>\n</div>\n\n<p><strong>Bandwagon Appeal:</strong> <strong>Ad populum </strong></p>\n\n<p>That you try to prove the argument because a lot of people are agreeing to it.</p>\n\n<div class=\"example\">\n<p>E.g. Many people buy extended warranties, so you should buy too.</p>\n</div>\n\n<p><strong>False Analogy:</strong></p>\n\n<p>When two things unlike are being compared based on a trivial similarity. <em>Basically you are comparing apples with oranges (just because they&nbsp;both are fruits??)</em>.</p>\n\n<div class=\"example\">\n<p>E.g. People are like dogs, because they respond best to discipline.</p>\n</div>\n\n<p><span class=\"ex_fontcolor\"><strong>Appeal to Authority: </strong></span><i>argumentum ad verecundiam</i> (&ldquo;argument from respect&rdquo;).</p>\n\n<p><span class=\"ex_fontcolor\">You claim something without giving logical reasons, just by saying that some authoritative figure, popular person says the same thing. <em>&quot;Even he/she says so&quot;</em>. </span></p>\n\n<div class=\"example\">\n<p><span class=\"ex_fontcolor\">E.g.&nbsp;</span>A book argues that global warming is not actually happening, and cites the research of one environmental scientist who has been studying climate change for several years.<span class=\"ex_fontcolor\"> </span></p>\n</div>\n\n<p><em>(Actually people take shortcuts by simply listening to authoritative figures, because doing the logical research is exhausting)</em></p>\n\n<p><strong>Gambler&#39;s Fallacy:</strong></p>\n\n<p>That a <strong><em>random</em></strong> event is more likely to happen just because it happened more frequently recently, or didn&#39;t happen for quite some time.</p>\n\n<div class=\"example\">\n<p>E.g. That family has had three girl babies in a row. The next one is bound to be a boy.</p>\n</div>\n\n<p><em>[This begs a question though; Is anything truly random?]</em></p>\n\n<p><em>This fallacy is interesting on another level. In the example above, does the family really believe that next child is bound to be a boy? I think it is more about their expectation and hope than their logical belief. Their mind makes up for this by creating a logical story.</em></p>\n\n<p><strong>Ignoring the third cause:</strong></p>\n\n<p>Not considering that maybe it&#39;s not that event1 caused event2, rather event3 caused both of them.</p>\n\n<div class=\"example\">\n<p>E.g. You have&nbsp;a sore throat and a runny nose. You&nbsp;think&nbsp;your&nbsp;runny nose caused your&nbsp;sore throat. In reality, your doctor discovers that you have&nbsp;strep, which caused both the sore throat and the runny nose.</p>\n</div>\n\n<p><strong>Post Hoc:</strong></p>\n\n<p>Short form of <i>post hoc ergo propter hoc</i> (&quot;after this, therefore because of this&quot;). Just because event1 occured before event2, you conclude that event2 was caused by event1. This is not always the case. This results in <em>Superstitions</em>.</p>\n\n<div class=\"example\">\n<p>E.g. &quot;I used to enjoy eating at this restaurant, but ever since they hired that new waitress, the food is not nearly so good.&quot;</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"example\">\n<p>E.g. &quot;Today morning, I saw you leaving the house. Later today the guy was found dead. Therefore, you must have killed him&quot;</p>\n</div>\n\n<p><i>Correlation Fallacy a.k.a. cum hoc ergo propter hoc</i> (Lat., &ldquo;with this therefore because of this&quot;): This fallacy happens when you mistakenly interpret two things found together as being causally related. Two things may correlate without a causal relation, or they may have some third factor causing both of them to occur. Or perhaps both things just, coincidentally, happened together. Correlation doesn&rsquo;t prove causation.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Middleground:</strong></p>\n\n<p>That you think the middle ground of two extreme views is the best without explaining why.</p>\n\n<div class=\"example\">\n<p>E.g. One of my friends&nbsp;says it&#39;s never okay to lie. My other friend says it&#39;s okay to lie as much as you want. I guess I believe that it&#39;s okay to lie sometimes.</p>\n</div>\n\n<p><strong>Misleading Vividness (Anecdotal fallacy):</strong></p>\n\n<p>When someone uses a small number of dramatic events to claim that something is more prevalent than it actually is based on statistics. This means that the argument is based more on personal stories rather than statistics and research.</p>\n\n<div class=\"example\">\n<p>Example: Yesterday, I was talking to a shopkeeper; he told me about a person next door who keeps&nbsp;his old father in guesthouse, doesn&#39;t care for him. His old father hardly gets anything to eat. Today, I saw a person yelling at his mother over a trifle thing. I think this generation is spoiled, it has no respect to elders.</p>\n</div>\n\n<p>(This is hasty generalization but with vivid anecdotes to support the argument. Maybe this is not even about logic, it&#39;s just that I was emotionally moved by these incidents)</p>\n\n<p><strong>Relativist Fallacy:</strong></p>\n\n<div class=\"example\">\n<p>E.g. It may be true for you that studying leads to better grades, but that&#39;s not true for me.</p>\n</div>\n\n<p><em>[Is it really about the logic here though? Or is it more about willingness? Plus, because it&#39;s not like &#39;whether two plus two equals four&#39;&nbsp;question, maybe relativistic idea is true. If not relativistic, then how can you even find an absolute one?]&nbsp;</em></p>\n\n<p><span><strong>Fallacy of division: </strong></span></p>\n\n<p><span>When you think that if something is true for the whole. It must the true for the part of the whole as well. </span></p>\n\n<div class=\"example\">\n<p><span>E.g.&nbsp;</span>Women in India don&#39;t work outside. Therefore, your mom must be a housewife.<span> </span></p>\n</div>\n\n<p><em>[Although everyone will agree that they know that it is just about probability being higher; but do they ever consider the other possibilities, most of the times?]</em></p>\n\n<p><strong>Spotlight fallacy:</strong></p>\n\n<p>That you start attributing a characterisitic to the whole group just because some part of the whole appeared in spotlight.</p>\n\n<div class=\"example\">\n<p>E.g. Young black males are dangerous because they belong to gangs, carry guns, do drugs, and break the law.
