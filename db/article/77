A wants what B has, B wants what A has. <em>(</em>Smith 1776, Menger 1892<em>)</em></p>\n\n<p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">&nbsp;What has been used as money? - Cattles, grain, clamshells, (<em>rare</em>) metals such as silver, gold. paper.&nbsp;<em>For example, a bank note issued by the Bank of England in the 1700s was a promise to pay the bearer a certain pound weight of sterling silver (hence the origin of the name of the British currency as &ldquo;pounds sterling&rdquo;)</em></p>\n\n<p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">Did societies go from barter system to money system?</p>\n\n<p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">We are not sure <em>(as with everything)</em>. Recent anthropological studies question the idea that early societies went from a barter economy to money; instead money seems to have arisen to keep track of pre-existing credit relationships (Graeber 2011, Martin 2013, Douglas 2016, Part III). <em>[Is this to justify the current system?]</em></p>\n\n<p><strong>Answer (B).</strong> Money is a physical representation of an abstract thing which is a <strong><em>promise</em></strong> to grant (or repay) a favor (product or services) to the holder of it. It is necessary that the granter is &quot;trustworthy&quot; and that what has been granted will be accepted by others if required for further trading.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">If it is so, then who guarantees the &quot;trust&quot;? - State and entities allowed by State (e.g. Banks).&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">Is money a social institution whose existence depends on&nbsp;&ldquo;collective intentionality&rdquo;: beliefs and attitudes that are shared in a community?</p>\n\n<p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">See Searle 1995, 2010; Smit, Buekens, &amp; du Plessis 2011</p>\n\n<p><strong>Is Money (as an institution), a precondition for modernity? &nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n<p>Yes, it puts a value on things and simplifies transactions. But in the process it also removes other forms of valuation.&nbsp;Georg Simmel (1900)</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>What is Finance?</strong></p>\n\n<p>A way of dealing with money. Managing payments and efficient use of money.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Lender&nbsp;➜ ..(Market).. ➜ Borrower</p>\n\n<p>Also, to allow participants to buy and sell money itself (rather than commodities) in form of financial products i.e. <em>Assets</em>.</p>\n\n<p>Other &ldquo;asset types&rdquo; besides money; central examples include credit arrangements (bank accounts, bonds), equity (shares or stocks), derivatives (futures, options, swaps, etc.) and funds (trusts)</p>\n\n<p>Since there is no actual exchange of tangible things but abstract speculations, trust etc, one may view the financial market as the &ldquo;meta-level&rdquo; of the economy, since it involves indirect trade or speculation on the success of other parts of the economy.</p>\n\n<p>The level of abstraction can sometimes become enormous: For example, a &ldquo;synthetic collateralized debt obligation&rdquo; (or &ldquo;synthetic <strong>CDO</strong>&rdquo;), a form of derivative common before the financial crisis, is a promise from person&nbsp;<i>A</i>&nbsp;(the seller) to person&nbsp;<i>B</i>&nbsp;(the buyer) that some persons&nbsp;<i>C</i>&nbsp;to&nbsp;<i>I</i>&nbsp;(speculators) will pay an amount of money depending on the losses incurred by person&nbsp;<i>J</i>&nbsp;(the holder of an underlying derivative), which typically depend on certain portions (so-called tranches) of the cash flow from persons&nbsp;<i>K</i>&nbsp;to&nbsp;<i>Q</i>&nbsp;(mortgage borrowers) originally promised to persons&nbsp;<i>R</i>&nbsp;to&nbsp;<i>X</i>&nbsp;(mortgage lenders) but then sold to person&nbsp;<i>Y</i>&nbsp;(the originator of the underlying derivative). The function of a synthetic CDO is mainly to spread financial risks more thinly between different speculators.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Do these financial products have intrinsic value?</strong></p>\n\n<p>How can they, when the basis of their making is subjective speculation.&nbsp;Two main factors that determine the price of a financial asset:</p>\n\n<ol>\n\t<li>The credibility or strength of the underlying promise (which will depend on the future cash flows generated by the asset); and</li>\n\t<li>Its transferability or popularity within the market, that is, how many other investors are interested in buying the asset.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>The complicacy is that (2) can influence&nbsp;(1).&nbsp;&ldquo;Reflexivity&rdquo; (Soros 1987, 2008)</p>\n\n<p>Financial assets are essentially promises of future money payments, a main challenge for financial agents is to develop rational expectations or hypotheses about relevant future outcomes. The two main factors in this regard are (1) expected return on the asset, which is typically calculated as the value of all possible outcomes weighted by their probability of occurrence, and (2) financial risk, which is typically calculated as the level of variation in these returns.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Financial intermediation and markets allow investors to spread their money over several assets with differing risk profiles (Pilbeam 2010, Shiller 2012). But it should be noted that this process focuses exclusively on historical price volatility.</p>\n\n<h2>Money and Ethics</h2>\n\n<p><strong>The Love for Money (Profit Motive):</strong></p>\n\n<p>What&#39;s the motive? - Whatever it is, it&#39;s unnatural.</p>\n\n<p>Aristotle argued that we should treat objects in ways that are befitting to their fundamental nature, and since money is not meant to be a good in itself but only a medium of exchange (see&nbsp;<a href=\"https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/money-finance/#WhatMone\">section 1.1</a>), he concluded that it is unnatural to desire money as an end in itself (<em>Politics</em>, 1252a&ndash;1260b)</p>\n\n<p>A similar thought is picked up by Marx, who argues that capitalism replaces the natural economic cycle of C&ndash;M&ndash;C (commodity exchanged for money exchanged for commodity) with M&ndash;C&ndash;M (money exchanged for commodity exchanged for money). Thus the endless accumulation of money becomes the sole goal of the capitalist, which Marx describes as a form of &ldquo;fetishism&rdquo; (Marx 1867, volume I).</p>\n\n<p>What does this exemplify? - Vice maybe.</p>\n\n<p>To have a love for money <em>(note not money as a means, but the love for money itself)</em> is typically associated with selfishness and greed, i.e., a desire to have as much as possible for oneself and/or more than one really needs (McCarty 1988, Walsh &amp; Lynch 2008). Another association is the loss of moral scruples so that one is ready to do anything for money.</p>\n\n<p>Allegations of greed soared after the 2008 crisis, when financial executives continued to receive million-dollar bonuses while many ordinary workers lost their jobs (Piketty 2014, McCall 2010).</p>\n\n<p>What does it signal? -&nbsp;The profit motive signals the absence of more appropriate motives.</p>\n\n<p>Kant argued that actions only have moral worth if they are performed for moral reasons, or, more specifically, for the sake of duty. Thus it is not enough that we do what is right, we must also do it&nbsp;<em>because</em>&nbsp;it is right (Kant 1785). Another relevant Kantian principle is that we never should treat others merely as means for our own ends, but always also as ends in themselves (see also&nbsp;<a href=\"https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/kant-moral/\">Kant&rsquo;s moral philosophy</a>). Both of these principles seem to contrast with the profit motive which therefore is rendered morally problematic (Bowie 1999, Maitland 2002). It should come as no surprise that Kant was a strong critic of several examples of &ldquo;commodification&rdquo; and other market excesses (see also&nbsp;<a href=\"https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/markets/\">markets</a>).</p>\n\n<p>Does it really matter what the intention is if the outcome is good?</p>\n\n<p>Although the baker and brewer only aim at their own respective good, Smith suggested, they are &ldquo;led by an invisible hand&rdquo; to at the same time promote the public good (Smith 1776, see also Mandeville 1732). This argument is typically viewed as a consequentialist vindication of the profit motive (see also&nbsp;<a href=\"https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/consequentialism/\">consequentialism</a>): positive societal effects can morally outweigh the possible shortcomings in individual virtue (Flew 1976).</p>\n\n<p>But isn&#39;t it that profit making allows individuals or even companies to utilize money in an efficient way?</p>\n\n<p>Two points: 1. How the profit comes to happen, 2. How exactly are you utilizing it for good.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Usury and Interest:</strong></p>\n\n<p>Societies in both Ancient and Medieval times typically condemned or banned the practice of &ldquo;usury&rdquo;, which originally meant all charging of interest on loans. As the practice started to become socially acceptable, usury came to mean the charging of&nbsp;<em>excessive rates</em>&nbsp;of interest. However, modern Islam still contains a general prohibition against interest, and many countries still have at least partial usury laws, most often setting an upper limit on interest rates.</p>\n\n<p>What could be wrong with lending at interest?</p>\n\n<p>Aristotle argued that there is something unnatural with &ldquo;money begetting money&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp;(<em>Politics</em>, 1258b)</p>\n\n<p>Although a lender can legitimately demand repayment of an amount equivalent to the loan, it is illegitimate to demand payment for the&nbsp;<em>use</em>&nbsp;of the borrowed amount and so adding interest is unnatural and wrong (<em>Summa Theologica</em>, II&ndash;II, Q78).</p>\n\n<p>Allowing interest may lead to societal instability (<em>The Republic</em>, II)</p>\n\n<p>Loans are typically extended by someone who is richer (someone with capital) to someone who is poorer (someone without it) and so asking for additional interest may increase the inequitable distribution of wealth (Sandberg 2012, Visser &amp; MacIntosh 1998).&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Lending often involves opportunism or exploitation in the sense of offering bad deals to poor people who have no other options (Graafland 2010)</p>\n\n<p>The Islamic condemnation of interest, or&nbsp;<em>riba</em>, adds an additional, third line of argument which holds that interest is essentially unearned or undeserved income: Since the lender neither partakes in the actual productive use of the money lent, nor exposes him- or herself to commercial risk, the lender cannot legitimately share in the gains produced by the loan (Ayub 2007, Birnie 1952, Thomas 2006). Based on this argument, contemporary Islamic banks insist that lenders and borrowers must form a business partnership in order for fees on loans to be morally legitimate (Ayub 2007, Warde 2010). Economists have over the years given several retorts to this argument. Some economists stress that lending also involves risk (e.g., that the borrower defaults and is unable to repay); others stress the so-called opportunity costs of lending (i.e., that the money could have been used more profitably elsewhere); and yet again others stress the simple time-preference of individuals (i.e., that we value present more than future consumption, and therefore the lender deserves compensation for postponing consumption).</p>\n\n<p>In a short text from 1787, Bentham famously poked fun at many of the classical anti-usury arguments and defended the practice of charging interest from a utilitarian standpoint (Bentham 1787).&nbsp;However, this does not mean that worries about the ethics of charging interest, and allegations of usury, have disappeared entirely in society. For instance, many people are outraged by the rates charged on modern payday loans, or the way in which rich countries exact interest on their loans from poor countries (Baradaran 2015, Graeber 2011, Herzog 2017a).</p>\n\n<p id=\"SpecGamb\"><strong>Speculation and gambling:</strong></p>\n\n<p>While investing in market your motive is either profit making, or genuine interest in the underlying enterprise? If first one, then you are gambler.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Speculation is like solely depending on luck, it&#39;s parasitic. <em>(What if it is calculated speculation?)</em></p>\n\n<p>High levels of risk-taking, or non-coordinated way of risk-taking is prone to harm not only the individual but the society as a whole.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>The myopia of finance is typically blamed for negative effects such as market volatility, the continuous occurrence of manias and crashes, inadequate investment in social welfare, and the general shortsightedness of the economy (e.g., Lacke 1996).</p>\n\n<p>The defenders of speculation say:-</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;Channelizing the funds to individual&nbsp;or companies who can use them in the most productive ways has a positive outcome. Even speculation in the narrower sense&mdash;of high-risk, short-term bets&mdash;can have a positive role to play: It can be used to &ldquo;hedge&rdquo; or off-set the risks of more long-term investments, and it contributes to sustaining &ldquo;market liquidity&rdquo; (that is, as a means for providing counterparties to trade with at any given point of time) which is important for an efficient pricing mechanism (Angel &amp; McCabe 2009, Koslowski 2009).</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"FairFinaMark\">Fairness in Financial Markets</h2>\n\n<p id=\"DeceFrau\"><strong>Deception and fraud:</strong></p>\n\n<p>&quot;Cook the book&quot; cases:&nbsp;fraudulent accounting practices, keeping huge debts off the company&rsquo;s balance sheet in an effort to make it look more profitable (McLean &amp; Elkind 2003). Deceptive marketing practices, hidden fees or costs, undisclosed or misrepresented financial risks, and outright Ponzi schemes.</p>\n\n<p>But this is not straightforward, what constitutes fraud? Is simply concealing or omitting financial information, or refraining from obtaining the information in the first place fraud?</p>\n\n<p>Denying to the weaker party in a financial transaction (such as a consumer or investor) information that is necessary to make a rational (or autonomous) decision (Boatright 2014, Duska &amp; Clarke 2002) is fraud.</p>\n\n<p>But this information does not make any difference if the weaker party is not able to process it in order to make decisions.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p id=\"AvoiConfInte\"><strong>Avoiding conflicts of interest:</strong></p>\n\n<p>Due to various problems including the complexity of analysis,&nbsp;the majority of ordinary consumers refrain from engaging in financial markets on their own and instead rely on the services of financial intermediaries, such as banks, investment funds, and insurance companies. The managers or employees of intermediaries have ample opportunity, and often also incentives, to misuse their customers&rsquo; money and trust.</p>\n\n<p>According to economic theory, namely, it is impossible to beat the average returns of the market for any given level of financial risk, at least in the long term. Therefore, funds who claim that they can do this for a fee are basically cheating their clients (cf. Hendry 2013, Kay 2015).</p>\n\n<p>Misuses again are hard to define but examples are: churning (trading excessively to generate high fees), stuffing (selling the bank&rsquo;s undesired assets to a client), front-running (buying an asset for the bank first and then reselling it to the client at a higher price) and tailgating (mimicking a client&rsquo;s trade to piggyback on his/her information) (Dilworth 1994; Heacock, Hill, &amp; Anderson 1987).</p>\n\n<p>To solve it we have:&nbsp;fiduciary duty, which imposes obligations on fiduciaries (those entrusted with others&rsquo; money) to act in the sole interest of beneficiaries (those who own the money) which is to maximize <em>financial</em>&nbsp;interests. But what about the broder interests&nbsp;such as when investing in fossil fuels may give high financial returns but pose serious risks to people&rsquo;s future (Lydenberg 2014; Sandberg 2013, 2016).</p>\n\n<p>Code of ethics as in case of profession of doctors and lawyers.</p>\n\n<p id=\"InsiTrad\"><strong>Insider trading:</strong></p>\n\n<p>Someone (not just one who is <em>inside</em> company) uses internal information (which has not been made public yet) for their own benefit e.g. buying, selling or even deciding to not take any action to maximize their profit.</p>\n\n<p>Why is it wrong though?</p>\n\n<p>Because, then it&#39;s not a fair play.&nbsp;Fair play requires a &ldquo;level playing field&rdquo;, i.e., that no participant starts from an unfairly advantaged position (Werhane 1989, 1991)</p>\n\n<p>There are many asymmetries of information in the market that are seemingly unproblematic, e.g., that an antiquary knows more about antiques than his or her customers (Lawson 1988, Machan 1996). So might it be the&nbsp;<em>inaccessibility</em>&nbsp;of inside information that is problematic? But against this, one could argue that, in principle, outsiders have the possibility to become insiders and thus to obtain the exact same information (Lawson 1988, Moore 1990).</p>\n\n<p>A second perspective views insider trading as a breach of duty, not towards the counterparty in the trade but towards the source of the information i.e. company.</p>\n\n<p>US legislation treats inside information as the property of the underlying company and, thus, insider trading is essentially a form of theft of corporate property (often called the misappropriation theory) (Lawson 1988). A related suggestion is that it can be seen as a violation of the fiduciary duty that insiders have towards the company for which they work (Moore 1990).&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>However, critics argue that the misappropriation theory misrepresents the relationship between companies and insiders. On the one hand, there are many normal business situations in which insiders are permitted or even expected to spread inside information to outside sources (Boatright 2014). On the other hand, if the information is the property of the company, why do we not allow it to be &ldquo;sold&rdquo; to insiders as a form of remuneration? (Engelen &amp; van Liedekerke 2010, Manne 1966)</p>\n\n<p>one of the main purposes of financial markets is to form (or &ldquo;discover&rdquo;) prices that reflect all available information about a company. Since insider trading contributes important information, it is likely to improve the process of price discovery (Manne 1966).&nbsp;Indeed, the same reasoning suggests that insider trading actually helps the counterparty in the trade to get a better price (since the insider&rsquo;s activity is likely to move the price in the &ldquo;right&rdquo; direction) so it is a victimless crime (Engelen &amp; Liedekerke 2010).</p>\n\n<p>However,&nbsp;Allowing insider trading may erode the moral standards of market participants by favoring opportunism over fair play (Werhane 1989). Moreover, many people may be dissuaded from even participating in the market since they feel that it is &ldquo;rigged&rdquo; to their disadvantage (Strudler 2009).</p>\n\n<h4 id=\"SystRiskFinaCris\"><strong>Systemic risk and financial crises</strong></h4>\n\n<p>Events like 2008 Financial Crises are systemic failures. Risk of failures across financial agents which&nbsp;impairs the functioning of the financial system as such (Brunnermeier &amp; Oehmke 2013, Smaga 2014) gives rise to ethical issues.</p>\n\n<p>But financial transactions always carry risk for participants. - Yeah, but in such events, externalities (third-parties) are also affected.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>So, financial agents should carry the responsibility to&nbsp;avoid causing unnecessary harm (James 2017, Linarelli 2017).</p>\n\n<p>Can finance professionals can be held morally responsible for these harms (de Bruin 2018)? Is society not responsible on political level for it?</p>\n\n<p><strong>Microfinance:</strong></p>\n\n<p>The extension of financial services, such as lending and saving, to poor people who are otherwise &ldquo;unbanked&rdquo;.&nbsp;The initiative started in some of the poorest countries of the world, such as Bangladesh and India.</p>\n\n<p>But why, is it to provide development aid to the poor?</p>\n\n<p>Microfinance is thought to be a particularly efficient way to alleviate poverty (Yunus 1998, 2007).&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>But, judging from the growing number of empirical &ldquo;impact studies&rdquo;, it seems more correct to say that microfinance is&nbsp;<em>sometimes</em>&nbsp;helpful, but at other times can be either ineffective or have negative side-effects (Hudon &amp; Sandberg 2013, Roodman 2012).</p>\n\n<p>Basic human rights include&nbsp;a right to savings and credit (Hudon 2009, Meyer 2018). But critics argue that the framework of human rights is not a good fit for financial services that come with both benefits and challenges (Gershman &amp; Morduch 2015, Sorell 2015).</p>\n\n<p>Proponents of microfinance argue that traditional state-led development projects have been too rigid and corrupt, whereas market-based initiatives are more flexible and help people to help&nbsp;<em>themselves</em>&nbsp;(Armend&aacute;riz &amp; Morduch 2010, Yunus 2007).&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>According to critics, however, it is the other way around: Markets will tend to breed greed and inequality, whereas real development is created by large-scale investments in education and infrastructure (Bateman 2010, H. Weber 2004).</p>\n\n<p>Reports have indicated that interest rates on microloans average at 20&ndash;30% per annum, and can sometimes be in excess of 100%, which is much higher than the rates for non-poor borrowers. This raises questions about usury (Hudon &amp; Ashta 2013; Rosenberg, Gonzalez, &amp; Narain 2009). However, some suggest a defense of &ldquo;second best&rdquo;, or last resort, when other sources of aid or cheaper credit are unavailable (Sandberg 2012).&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Microfinance institutions have also been accused of using coercive lending techniques and forceful loan recovery practices (Dichter &amp; Harper (eds) 2007; Priyadarshee &amp; Ghalib 2012).&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>This raises questions about the ethical justifiability of commercial activity directed at the desperately poor, because very poor customers may have no viable alternative to accepting deals that are both unfair and exploitative (Arnold &amp; Valentin 2013, Hudon &amp; Sandberg 2013).</p>\n\n<p><strong>Socially Responsible Investment:</strong></p>\n\n<p>Should investors invest in enterprises that sustain such unjustifiable practices as&nbsp;sweatshop labor and environmental degradation?</p>\n\n<p>How far would you analyze the effects of an enterprise?</p>\n\n<p>Is it&nbsp;possible to find any investment opportunity that is completely &ldquo;pure&rdquo; or devoid of possible moral taint (Kolers 2001)</p>\n\n<p>Can a group of ethical investors even have a significant change in price in Stock market (which actually determines a companies worth/capital)?</p>\n\n<p>At least investors can use their financial power to affect society in positive way e.g. push management to adopt&nbsp;more ambitious social policies and/or seeking out environmentally friendly technology firms?&nbsp;(Mackenzie 1997, Sandberg 2008)</p>\n\n<p>But they invite greater financial risks (Sandberg 2011), in fact that might be the reason they are less common.</p>\n\n<h2>Political Philosophy of Money</h2>\n\n<p id=\"FinaDemo\"><strong>Financialization and Democracy:</strong></p>\n\n<p>Financial power gives rise to political power and they can use it to influence politics in a way that is dangerous to democracy. (Lindblom 1977, 1982; Przeworski &amp; Wallerstein 1988; Cohen 1989; B. Barry 2002; Christiano 2010, 2012)</p>\n\n<p>One major issue&nbsp;is the problem of banks that are so large and interconnected that their failure would risk taking down the whole financial system&mdash;hence, they can anticipate that they will be bailed out by tax-payers&rsquo; money, which creates a huge &ldquo;moral hazard&rdquo; problem (e.g., Pistor 2013, 2017).</p>\n\n<p>In addition, current legal systems find it difficult to impose accountability for complex processes of divided labor, which is why there were very few legal remedies after the financial crisis of 2008 (e.g., Reiff 2017).</p>\n\n<p>We may ask whether societies that are highly financialized can ever be true democracies, or whether they are more likely to be &ldquo;post-democracies&rdquo; (Crouch 2004). For example, states with high levels of sovereign debt will need to consider the reaction of financial markets in every significant policy decision (see, e.g., Streeck 2013 [2014])</p>\n\n<p>After the financial crisis of 2008, there have been many calls for reregulation.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulatory_responses_to_the_subprime_crisis\">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulatory_responses_to_the_subprime_crisis</a></p>\n\n<p><strong>Financialization and Domestic Justice:</strong></p>\n\n<p>Should everyone have right to participate in financial markets?</p>\n\n<p>Why not, given that we have adopted capitalist system at such a scale?&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>What about socio-economic inequality?</p>\n\n<p>Those with managerial positions within the financial sector are disproportionately represented among the very top end of the income distribution, and so the growth of inequality can in part be explained by the growth in the financial sector itself (Piketty 2014).&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>There may also be an effect on social norms, whereby the &ldquo;hypermeritocratic&rdquo; norms of the financial sector have played a part in increasing social tolerance for inequality in society more broadly (Piketty 2014: 265; see also O&rsquo;Neill 2017).&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Which goals of distributive justice should be achieved within markets&mdash;and specifically, within financial markets&mdash;and which ones by other means, for example through taxation and redistribution?</p>\n\n<p>The latter has been the standard approach used by many welfare systems: the idea being to let markets run their course, and then to achieve the desired patterns of distribution by taxation and redistribution. If one remains within that paradigm, questions arise about whether the financial sector should be taxed more highly.</p>\n\n<p>In contrast, the approach of &ldquo;pre-distribution&rdquo; (Hacker 2011, O&rsquo;Neill &amp; Williamson 2012), or what Dietsch calls &ldquo;process redistribution&rdquo; (2010), is to design the rules of the economic game such that they contribute to bringing about the distributive pattern that is seen as just. This could, for example, mean regulating banking services and credit markets in ways that reduce inequality, for example by imposing regulations on payday lenders and banks, so that poor individuals are protected from falling into a spiral of ever higher debt. A more radical view could be to see the financial problems faced by such individuals as being caused by more general structural injustices the solution of which does not necessarily require interventions with the financial industry, but rather more general redistributive (or predistributive) policies.</p>\n\n<p>Why not integrate the&nbsp;distributive concerns into monetory policies e.g. Money creation itself?</p>\n\n<p>Put control of the money supply into hands of technical experts: removing monetary policy from democratic politics, otherwise&nbsp;politicians might abuse monetary policy to try to boost the economy before elections. Plus, the&nbsp;central banks have focused on the stability of currencies and, in some cases, levels of employment.</p>\n\n<p>But after the financial crisis of 2008, many central banks have used unconventional measures, such as &ldquo;quantitative easing&rdquo;, which had strongly regressive effects, favoring the owners of stocks or of landed property (Fontan et al. 2016, Dietsch 2017); they did not take into account other societal goals, e.g., the financing of green energy, either.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Would other measures, for instance &ldquo;helicopter money&rdquo; that is distributed to all citizens, have been a better alternative?&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>And if such measures are used, is it still appropriate to think of central banks as institutions in which nothing but technical expertise is required, or should there be some form of accountability to society? (Fontan, Claveau, &amp; Dietsch 2016; Dietsch 2017; Riles 2018).</p>\n\n<p>In today&#39;s world, banks in effect create new money when they make new loans to individual or business customers (see McLeay, Radia, &amp; Thomas 2014; see also Palley 1996; Ryan-Collins et al. 2012; Werner 2014a,b). James Tobin refers to commercial bank-created money, in an evocative if now dated image as &ldquo;fountain pen money&rdquo;, that is, money created with the swish of the bank manager&rsquo;s fountain pen (Tobin 1963).</p>\n\n<p>In the&nbsp;hybrid public-private monetary system that we have, it is true that private commercial banks create money, but they nevertheless do so in a way that involves being regulated and subject to the authority of the central bank within each monetary jurisdiction, with that central bank also acting as &ldquo;lender of last resort&rdquo; (Bagehot 1873) when inter-bank lending dries up.</p>\n\n<p>Should it be fully public? Or, should it be fullyy private rather than hybrid?</p>\n\n<p>Fully public implementation for example by the central bank lending directly to firms and households. A&nbsp;fully public system of money creation would allow a smoother transmission of democratic decisions regarding economic governance; or simply because of the consequences of such a system with regards to socioeconomic inequality and environmental sustainability (see Jackson &amp; Dyson 2012; Wolf 2014a,b; Lain&agrave; 2015; Dyson, Hodgson, &amp; van Lerven 2016a,b; Ingham, Coutts, &amp; Konzelmann 2016; Dow 2016; for commentary and criticism see Goodhart &amp; Jensen 2015; Fontana &amp; Sawyer 2016).</p>\n\n<p>Fully private: a system of &ldquo;free banking&rdquo; (e.g., Simons 1936; Friedman 1962; von Hayek 1978; Selgin 1988). Some of Bitcoin&rsquo;s advocates drawing on similar libertarian arguments to those offered by Hayek and Selgin (see Golumbia 2016).</p>\n\n<p id=\"FinaGlobJust\"><strong>Finance and Global Justice:</strong></p>\n\n<p>The financial system is one of the most globalized systems of social interaction that currently exist, and global entanglements are hard to deny (e.g., Valentini 2011: 195&ndash;8).&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>There are a number of institutions, especially the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund (IMF), that constitute a rudimentary global order of finance. Arguably, many countries, especially poorer ones, cannot reasonably opt out of the rules established by these institutions (e.g., Hassoun 2012, Krishnamurthy 2014).&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>It might therefore appear to be required by justice that these institutions be governed in a way that represents the interests of all countries. But because of historical path-dependencies, and because a large part of their budget comes from Western countries, the governance structures are strongly biased in their favor (for example, the US can veto all important decisions in the IMF). Miller (2010: 134&ndash;41) has described this situation as &ldquo;indirect financial rule&rdquo; by the US.</p>\n\n<p>An issue worth noting in this context is the fact that the US dollar, and to a lesser degree the Euro, function as&nbsp;<em>de facto</em>&nbsp;global currencies, with a large part of global trade being conducted in these currencies (e.g., Mehrling 2011, Eichengreen 2011).</p>\n\n<p>This allows the issuing countries to run a current account deficit, which amounts to a redistribution from poorer to richer countries for which compensation might be owed (Reddy 2005: 224&ndash;5). This fact also raises questions about the distribution of power in the global sphere, which has often been criticized as favoring Western countries (e.g., Gulati 1980, United Nations 2009).&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>However, global financial markets serve not only to finance trade in goods and services; there are also questions about fluctuations in these markets that result exclusively from speculations (see also sect.1.4.3 above). Such fluctuations can disproportionately harm poorer countries, which are more vulnerable to movements of capital or rapid changes in commodity prices. Hence, an old proposal that has recently been revived and defended from a perspective of global justice is that of a &ldquo;Tobin tax&rdquo; (Tobin 1978), which would tax financial transactions and thereby reduce volatility in international financial markets (Reddy 2005, Wollner 2014).</p>\n\n<p>A second feature of the current global order that has been criticized from a perspective of justice is the &ldquo;borrowing privilege&rdquo;. As Pogge describes (e.g., 2008: chap. 4), the governments of countries can borrow on international financial markets, no matter whether they have democratic legitimacy or not. This means that rogue governments can finance themselves by incurring debts that future generations of citizens will have to repay.</p>\n\n<p>Sovereign debt raises a number of questions that are related to global justice. Usually, the contracts on which they are based are considered as absolutely binding (e.g., Suttle 2016), which can threaten national sovereignty (Dietsch 2011). This holds in particular with regard to what has been called &ldquo;odious&rdquo; debt (Sack 1927, Howse 2007, Dimitriu 2015, King 2016): cases in which government officials sign debt contracts in order to enrich themselves, with lenders being aware of this fact. Such cases have been at the center of calls for a jubilee for indebted nations. At the moment, there are no binding international rules for how to deal with sovereign bankruptcy, and countries in financial distress have no systematic possibility of making their claims heard, which is problematic from a perspective of justice (e.g., Palley 2003; Reddy 2005: 26&ndash;33; Herman 2007; C. Barry &amp; Tomitova 2007; Wollner 2018). The IMF, which often supports countries in restructuring sovereign debt, has often made this support conditional upon certain requirements about rearranging the economic structures of a country (for a discussion of the permissibility of such practices see C. Barry 2011).</p>\n\n<p>The global dynamics of financial systems makes it very difficult for countries especially smaller ones&nbsp;to install the more rigid financial regulations that would be required from a perspective of justice.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>Is Financialization of everything good?</strong></p>\n\n<p>Market for reproductive affairs e.g. egg donors, sperm donors market.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baby_M\" target=\"_blank\">Baby M Case</a></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n","authorId":null,"subject":"philosophy","tags":null,"img":null,"summary":null,"lastUpdated":null}
