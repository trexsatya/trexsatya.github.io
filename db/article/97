The essence of life is that there&#39;s something which thinks of itself as an entity, a self, and tries to prevent its self from the rest of the existence, it feels that there&#39;s inherent separation of this self from the rest of the existence.. If it didn&#39;t feel this inherent separation, why would it even try to secure itself, why would it try to even preserve itself,<br />\nor not why actually how even would it do anything as simple as making a movement. To make a single movement, it has to has a conception of inherent &quot;self&quot; (as if thinking that &quot;I moved&quot;)</p>\n\n<p>What is a thing, an entity?<br />\nSee how we come see a thing in our psyche..</p>\n\n<p>(Psychological) Effects of the this kind of inquiry/meditation..</p>\n\n<p><br />\nIs there a chariot which is other than its parts?<br />\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Do &quot;I&quot; depend on parts of me?
