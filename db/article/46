How should one treat others and why?</li>\n\t<li>What is right? What is wrong?</li>\n\t<li>Why is something right or wrong? Is it decidable by logic and reason?</li>\n\t<li>What are the scenarios where the concept of right and wrong do not apply (or, are very hard to apply, at least)?</li>\n\t<li>Is there something that is universally, objectively right or wrong?&nbsp;Is it possible to actually know or find out?</li>\n\t<li>How much context and circumstances would you consider while evaluating something as right or wrong? E.g. what a child should do might be very different from what an adult should do.</li>\n\t<li>Why should you even evaluate what&#39;s right and wrong, some people just &quot;go with the flow&quot;.</li>\n\t<li>How did we begin considering moral and immoral, right and wrong?</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Morality is something that is considered to result in &quot;goodness&quot;. Goodness in what sense? What is goodness? And good for whom - yourself, your friends/relatives/social-groups, your nation, all the people in the world, all the animals in the world, or the whole universe? Moreover, good for what timescale, good for now, good for a long time, good for as long as we can know, good for always?&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Morality is not limited to <strong>actions</strong><em><strong>,</strong></em>&nbsp;<strong>decisions</strong>&nbsp;and <strong>outcomes</strong> only. It is also concerned with <strong><em>Intentions</em></strong>.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><em>[One might believe that we can never know what the real intention behind an action is, so why bother about it? All that matters is what the action is and what it brings about... But that&#39;s an immature belief. If you look closely, an evil person with an evil master plan can bring about a good outcome while he is preparing for his master plan. There, based on outcome you might say that the action is good, but based on intention it&#39;s clearly wrong.]</em></p>\n\n<p>Golden Rule:&nbsp;</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>&quot;<strong>One should treat others as one would like others to treat oneself.</strong>&quot;</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><em>[E.g. you should not make fun of someone, if you cannot take a joke from him/her. You should not lie to someone, if you do not like to be lied. You should not eat animals, if you do not like to be eaten yourself. On the positive side, you should respect everyone if you like to be respected by everyone.]&nbsp;</em></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>Why does someone consider&nbsp;something right or wrong?</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>If something is <em>natural</em>, does it mean that it is right? Nature has so much variation afterall <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filial_cannibalism\" target=\"_blank\"><em>(some animals even eat their own children)</em></a>, why would you pick one (or even many) example(s) in nature and ignore the other?</li>\n\t<li>If something is unnatural, does it mean that it is wrong? What does even &quot;unnatural&quot; mean? Isn&#39;t every possibility result of nature and hence natural by definition?</li>\n\t<li>Can we say that it is wrong if a person (or an agent) does not act what he &quot;ought to do&quot;, given that he has a purpose?</li>\n\t<li>Is &quot;purpose&quot; necessary for morality?</li>\n\t<li>If something does not result in harm (even though the intention of acting out was wrong), is it still wrong?</li>\n\t<li>Are spiritual /religious notions necessary for a person to be moral?</li>\n\t<li>Isn&#39;t some sort of psychological, emotional, spiritual energy required for morality? It&#39;s obviously not an easy thing to remain moral.</li>\n\t<li>Should right and wrong be decided based on democracy? Why? <em>(Even though &quot;wisdom of the crowd&quot; might, on a superfluous level, suggest that it is a good idea, the same principle requires that the crowd is not polarized to one idea, otherwise it just doesn&#39;t work. In reality, society is always polarized towards one idea or another.)&nbsp;</em>Also, the democratic&nbsp;opinions change&nbsp;with time. So, how can you use this reasoning to decide on what&#39;s right or wrong?&nbsp;One might think that at least it gives you a sense of right and wrong in a particular time and context. But, from the simple fact that moral conceptions have changed previously means that at some point of time, majority was wrong. Then maybe it&#39;s not even about right or wrong, it&#39;s just about agreement. Then where did this idea even come from? Why is this idea there in our minds?</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>Is&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suicide\" target=\"_blank\">suicide</a><em>&nbsp;(killing yourself when life seems unbearable, unrecoverable to you)&nbsp;</em>wrong? What about&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euthanasia\" target=\"_blank\">Euthanasia</a>&nbsp;<em>(killing a person suffering from some disease, when life seems unbearable and unrecoverable)</em>?&nbsp;What about murder,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massacre\" target=\"_blank\">massacre</a>, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democide\" target=\"_blank\">democide</a>, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genocide\" target=\"_blank\">genocide</a>?</li>\n\t<li>Is killing for self-protection wrong?

How could you justify taking someone&#39;s hard-earned <em>(or even soft-earned)</em> money?</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>It seems that sometimes even if one realizes that it is wrong, it doesn&#39;t stop them from taking that &#39;wrong&#39; action. Why? Why is a person controlled by one idea rather than the other one? Why&nbsp;is that a person is so convinced that something is wrong and he will not do it no matter what, while another person may think that maybe it is wrong but he has to do that anyway;&nbsp;yet another person is so convinced that it is not wrong at all? There are different things involved here:</p>\n\n<ol>\n\t<li>Sense of morality itself.</li>\n\t<li>The idea (image, picture) of right and wrong, as in what is right and what is wrong.</li>\n\t<li>Conviction to one&#39;s belief (which is built upon the sense of morality).</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Some conceptions regarding Morality and Ethics:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>&quot;This is our tradition, we must do it. This only is the right thing to do&quot; - Every common man<br />\n<span style=\"color:#8e44ad;\">&nbsp; &nbsp;<span style=\"font-size:14px;\"><em><span style=\"font-family:Georgia,serif;\">(But, why?&nbsp; Should it be, just because it is so?&nbsp; Maybe it was relevant at some point of time, but is it still relevant? We can respect the history of it, but do we have to stick to it?)</span></em></span></span></p>\n\n<p>&quot;This is pleasant, desirable. That&#39;s why this is the right thing to do&quot; - &nbsp;<span class=\"math\">\\text{Good} \\iff \\text{Pleasant}</span><br />\n<span style=\"color:#8e44ad;\"><span style=\"font-size:14px;\">&nbsp; (Is everything that is pleasant or desirable right? Also, pleasure is a subjective experience, so pleasant to whom?&nbsp; How broad is the context around &#39;pleasant&#39; here? E.g. heavy drinking is pleasant to many. Also, if you say that &quot;it is right for me at least&quot;, then would you consider the implications and effects of it? You don&#39;t live in isolation afterall. How much would you consider the effect of your actions, your responsibilities?)</span></span></p>\n\n<p>&quot;I don&#39;t feel that this is the right thing to do. It just does not feel right&quot;.<br />\n&nbsp;<span style=\"color:#8e44ad;\"><span style=\"font-size:14px;\">(Whatever it is that makes you feel so, the same thing makes someone else feel that it is the right thing to do.)</span></span></p>\n\n<p>&quot;People will automatically do good, if they know what is good. In fact they do, everyone does what is good as per their view. It&#39;s just that they don&#39;t know the right form of right and wrong.&quot; - Socrates.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;This is conducive to my purpose, hence it is the right thing to do&quot;. <span style=\"font-size:14px;\">Buddhist texts employ this idea, a lot.</span><br />\n&nbsp;<span style=\"color:#8e44ad;\"><span style=\"font-size:14px;\">(What if the purpose itself is &quot;immoral&quot;?)</span></span></p>\n\n<p>&quot;The principal moral motive is to maximize pleasure and minimize pain&quot;. The pleasure ranges from momentary&nbsp;sensual pleasures to spriritual bliss. This also ranges from pleasure for oneself, to family, to community, to everyone.<br />\n&nbsp;<span style=\"color:#8e44ad;\"><span style=\"font-size:14px;\">(But pleasure has many forms, some of them very nasty.)</span></span></p>\n\n<p>&quot;Pursuit of pleasure is good, but only when accompanied by moderation and caution. Avoid pain and fear which bring unhappiness&quot; - Epicurus</p>\n\n<p>&quot;promoting the benefit of all under heaven and eliminating harm to all under heaven&quot; - Mohists<br />\n&nbsp;<span style=\"color:#8e44ad;\"><span style=\"font-size:14px;\">(But the benefit of one costs pain/loss/harm to someone else;&nbsp;biggest example is natural food chain)</span></span></p>\n\n<p>&quot;You should speak truth, because it is inherently the right thing to do&quot;</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Something is good regardless of the outcome, if the person acts out of respect for the law, out of duty. Lying is wrong, because if lying became universal phenomenon none of our&nbsp;lives would be stable and secure&quot; - Kant<br />\n&nbsp;<span style=\"color:#8e44ad;\"><span style=\"font-size:14px;\">(Where does this sense of duty come from? Obviuosly it is not flawless.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heinrich_Himmler\">Heinrich_Himmler</a>&nbsp;considered his duty to be a helper in Nazi mission. According to him he was to Hitler like Arjuna was to Krishna in <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mahabharata\" target=\"_blank\">Mahabharata</a>.)</span></span></p>\n\n<p>&quot;Whatever people agree on after discourse with rational approach is right&quot; - Habermas<br />\n<span style=\"color:#8e44ad;\"><span style=\"font-size:14px;\">&nbsp; (This explains why something that was considered right/wrong is now seen otherwise. This also means right/wrong can differ from place to place, time to time, group to group; So basically it&#39;s right as long as people have taken rational approach to think about it. But Rationality itself is limited, it leads to paradoxes and cul-de-sac when done precisely.)</span></span></p>\n\n<p>&quot;The concepts of right and wrong are evolutionary, social/cultural things&quot;<br />\n<span style=\"color:#8e44ad;\"><span style=\"font-size:14px;\">&nbsp;(And what drives this evolution? What is its goal? Maybe there&#39;s none! Just enjoy the ride! But the same principle &quot;Just enjoy the ride&quot; might motivate the immoral acts.)</span></span></p>\n\n<p>&quot;It is wrong because it&nbsp;is not sustainable, it is not workable, it is not fruitful, effective&quot;<br />\n<span style=\"color:#8e44ad;\"><span style=\"font-size:14px;\">&nbsp;(Well, then should one try to make it happen? At what point should one give up on this? For example, when someone says Polygamy is not sustainable because.. what if someone has made it successful? Should one try to make it happen or just consider it wrong and avoid it?)</span></span></p>\n\n<p>&quot;It is wrong because it does not follow the framework of a particular&nbsp;concept/institution&quot;<br />\n<span style=\"color:#8e44ad;\"><span style=\"font-size:14px;\">&nbsp;(Is the framework fixed, can it not change? For example, when someone says that Gay Marriage is wrong because the institue of marriage does not inherently recognize gay people... Is the institute of marriage fixed, can it not expand? Why is someone so much attached to a particular form of this framework?)</span></span></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Does it even matter whether something is actually&nbsp;&quot;right&quot; or &quot;wrong&quot;, since it&#39;s the energy that people put into applying one particular conception of morality over the other. And the &quot;weaker&quot; notions of morality just die away, something like natural selection.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>Regarding the naturalistic arguments:</strong> You can say that <q>it is a natural thing to ......</q>&nbsp;But, then you see that there are animals in nature which eat their own children when needed. And yet, hardly any <em>sane</em> human would say that it&#39;s a right thing to do. One can counter-argue that those animals then lack something which other animals have. So, then it comes down to that &quot;specific something&quot; (let&#39;s call it <em>instrument</em>) which decides whether an animal would take a particular action or not. And perhaps, it&#39;s fair to assume that animals have mostly the similar traits, and hence the same instrument. But in humans you can see that the variation in traits is enormous, then how could you expect from all humans to have the &quot;same instrument&quot; that would make it possible to have a same concept of good and bad?</p>\n\n<p>Then it comes down to acceptance of each others&#39; conception and practice of morality as long as it doesn&#39;t cause any harm. But the problem is that avoiding causing harm is not possible, and again it takes enormous amount of energy to even try to prevent yourself from causing harm. I have an example would seem unrelated at first sight: Let&#39;s say you go the park for a walk. You are just enjoying your time, walking and talking on the phone etc. And at the same time you are not even aware that you have killed many insects. You didn&#39;t do anything deliberately, and you didn&#39;t have to do anything, just don&#39;t pay attention and you cause so much damage to some life.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Now see the same scenario in an abstract form, if you don&#39;t care about insects replace them with humans which are unfortunate in the&nbsp;way that they get to bear the burden of other humans&#39; actions which have more influence, and they can&#39;t exert any force whatsoever. You might not even be aware how much damage your actions are causing to whom, just because you didn&#39;t pay attention.</p>\n\n<p>Also, just observe it that we don&#39;t actually accept anybody, we don&#39;t just accept any idea, practice. We accept only those things which resonate with us. And it applies to every possible type of person, be it moral or immoral. So, the immoral person will accept immoral person and ideas, and so on.</p>\n\n<p>Then it comes down to law enforcement. But law enforcement is itself subject to the moral attitude of the practioners. Law enforcement is certainly necessary, we simply cannot fix this problem of morality. But law enforcement is not the cure!</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h2>Virtues and Vices</h2>\n\n<p><strong>Virtues</strong> and <strong>Vices</strong>&nbsp;are mentioned in many/all different cultures/religions. These are the traits that correspond to morality and immorality respectively.</p>\n\n<p>Although we have a huge literature around virtues, vices and ethics, we do not have precise definitions of any of these. <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plato\" target=\"_blank\">Plato</a>&#39;s most of the work was dedicated towards an attempt to find a precise definition of these but was not successful. We know these by network of examples.&nbsp;And, either there are no boundaries and definitions or they are very blurry, fuzzy, incomplete if there are any.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Seven Virtues and Vices in Christian cultures</strong></p>\n\n<table cellspacing=\"8\" class=\"sortable wikitable jquery-tablesorter\">\n\t<thead>\n\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t<th class=\"headerSort\" role=\"columnheader button\" tabindex=\"0\" title=\"Sort ascending\">Vice</th>\n\t\t\t<th class=\"headerSort\" role=\"columnheader button\" tabindex=\"0\" title=\"Sort ascending\"><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Latin\">Latin</a></th>\n\t\t\t<th class=\"headerSort headerSortDown\" role=\"columnheader button\" tabindex=\"0\" title=\"Sort ascending\"><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italian_language\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Italian language\">Italian</a></th>\n\t\t\t<th class=\"headerSort\" role=\"columnheader button\" tabindex=\"0\" title=\"Sort ascending\"><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seven_virtues\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Seven virtues\">Virtue</a></th>\n\t\t\t<th class=\"headerSort\" role=\"columnheader button\" tabindex=\"0\" title=\"Sort ascending\">Latin</th>\n\t\t\t<th class=\"headerSort\" role=\"columnheader button\" tabindex=\"0\" title=\"Sort ascending\">Italian</th>\n\t\t</tr>\n\t</thead>\n\t<tbody>\n\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t<td><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pride\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Pride\">Pride</a></td>\n\t\t\t<td><i>Superbia</i></td>\n\t\t\t<td>&quot;Superbia&quot;</td>\n\t\t\t<td><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humility\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Humility\">Humility</a></td>\n\t\t\t<td><i>Humilitas</i></td>\n\t\t\t<td>&quot;Umilt&agrave;&quot;</td>\n\t\t</tr>\n\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t<td><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lust\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Lust\">Lust</a></td>\n\t\t\t<td><i>Luxuria</i></td>\n\t\t\t<td>&quot;Lussuria&quot;</td>\n\t\t\t<td><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chastity\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Chastity\">Chastity</a></td>\n\t\t\t<td><i>Castitas</i></td>\n\t\t\t<td>&quot;Castit&agrave;&quot;</td>\n\t\t</tr>\n\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t<td><a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wrath\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Wrath\">Wrath</a></td>\n\t\t\t<td><i>Ira</i></td>\n\t\t\t<td>&quot;Ira&quot;</td>\n\t\t\t<td><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patience\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Patience\">Patience</a></td>\n\t\t\t<td><i>Patientia</i></td>\n\t\t\t<td>&quot;Pazienza&quot;</td>\n\t\t</tr>\n\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t<td><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Envy\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Envy\">Envy</a></td>\n\t\t\t<td><i>Invidia</i></td>\n\t\t\t<td>&quot;Invidia&quot;</td>\n\t\t\t<td><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gratitude\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Gratitude\">Gratitude</a></td>\n\t\t\t<td><i>Gratia</i></td>\n\t\t\t<td>&quot;Gratitudine&quot;</td>\n\t\t</tr>\n\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t<td><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gluttony\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Gluttony\">Gluttony</a></td>\n\t\t\t<td><i>Gula</i></td>\n\t\t\t<td>&quot;Gola&quot;</td>\n\t\t\t<td><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temperance_(virtue)\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Temperance (virtue)\">Temperance</a></td>\n\t\t\t<td><i>Moderatio</i></td>\n\t\t\t<td>&quot;Temperanza&quot;</td>\n\t\t</tr>\n\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t<td><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greed\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Greed\">Greed</a></td>\n\t\t\t<td><i>Avaritia</i></td>\n\t\t\t<td>&quot;Avarizia&quot;</td>\n\t\t\t<td><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charity_(virtue)\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Charity (virtue)\">Charity</a> (or, sometimes, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generosity\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Generosity\">Generosity</a>)</td>\n\t\t\t<td><i>Caritas</i> (<i>Liberalitas</i>)</td>\n\t\t\t<td>&quot;Generosit&agrave;&quot;</td>\n\t\t</tr>\n\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t<td><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sloth_(deadly_sin)\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Sloth (deadly sin)\">Sloth</a></td>\n\t\t\t<td><i>Acedia</i></td>\n\t\t\t<td>&quot;Accidia&quot;</td>\n\t\t\t<td><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diligence\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Diligence\">Diligence</a></td>\n\t\t\t<td><i>Industria</i></td>\n\t\t\t<td>&quot;Diligenza&quot;</td>\n\t\t</tr>\n\t</tbody>\n</table>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;<b>Arishadvarga</b> or <b>Shadripu </b>in Hinduism:</p>\n\n<ol>\n\t<li>Lust or desire <b>(<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sanskrit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Sanskrit\">Sanskrit</a>: <a class=\"new\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=%E0%A4%95%E0%A4%BE%E0%A4%AE&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"काम (page does not exist)\">काम</a>)</b> &ndash;

But, then another question comes up &mdash; Is there an action possible without desire (which is the root element for all of these)? How are you so sure that it is not? How would you be convinced that it is possible? Would you be convinced if you are given some examples, or would you discard those examples? Would you like to experiment with yourself to see whether it is possible, or would you discard the possibility right away?</p>\n\n<p class=\"firstHeading\" lang=\"en\">On a theoretical side, an action is possible only because of energy. Are you convinced that there is no energy possible without desire? You might say that even if such an action is possible, it would be unguided. Yes, but it would be pure. On another perspective, it can also be seen that from infinite possibilities of actions, one takes a guided action only because it is more efficient energy-wise. So, what if you possess enough energy?&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"firstHeading\" lang=\"en\">From another angle, it can be seen that all of these result from habits which has been built on a very very long time, some are part of evolutionary process or at least have been supported and enhanced by evolution.

Remember, just like with any other models (e.g. physical models) these too are just abstractions of far more complex real situations that exist in society, in the world.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong><a href=\"#\" reactlink=\"/article/178\">Utilitrarian Model:</a></strong></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;Simple theory &quot;Just do whatever that brings maximum benefit/good for maximum amount of people&quot;. In real life sometimes, it becomes hard to describe what the benefit/good is, and how much variables should we consider e.g. what is good now maybe bad in the long run.</p>\n\n<p>It&#39;s interesting that the our public policies are based on this model only.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Formula-1: Calculate the resulting net utility (#positive-#negative) to decide. (Utilitarian/Consequentialist approach)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>Kantian Model:</strong></p>\n\n<p>Kant has done one of the most complex analyses on Morality, so it&#39;s hard to summarize. But essentially, Kant says that in order to decide what is the right thing to do&nbsp;first you have to be free (from natural physical desires which guide your actions normally). An act is moral only when it is done with a right sense of duty <em>(intention matters more than the result)</em>. Effectively, this model demands a person to become free person <em>(sort of selfless)</em> in order to be able to make moral decisions.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Formula-2: It is not right if it is not done for the morality&#39;s sake itself, based on free-will/pure-reasoning (Kantian/Categorical approach). Intention matters more than the consequences.</p>\n\n<p>Formula-3: Universalize it, if everybody follows the same way, what happens; if the thing in question loses its essence, then it is immoral/wrong. (Kantian approach). E.g. if everybody keeps breaking the promise, the concept of promise will no longer make sense.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>Principle of Reciprocity and Contracts:</strong></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Formula-4: Reciprocity; it is moral to reciprocate if there is an implicit contract. It is necessary that all the parties involved in the contract have the same understanding about the contract, nothing is hidden willingly or unwillingly.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>Paternalism:</strong></p>\n\n<p>The idea that State (or any authority figure)&nbsp;can decide on some matters for your own good is called Paternalism.</p>\n\n<p>Example: Does the state have right to coerce me into putting my seat-belt on? I can decide what&#39;s best for me..</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#8e44ad;\"><em>(The deeper question is what gives someone authority to decide for someone else? If it isn&#39;t a power-game, then what is it?)</em></span></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>Mills Model for state (government) morality in terms of Freedom:</strong></p>\n\n<p>Mill&#39;s On Liberty book tries to answer &quot;when is legitimate for the state to interfere with our liberty?&quot;</p>\n\n<p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">1. <strong>Harm Principle:</strong> The only legitimate ground for social coercion is to prevent harm to others. Genuine harm, not offence. [But the problem is what is genuine harm? Is hate speech genuine harm or offence?] Basically it means just physical harm, brutal actions. What about when some has enough drugs for themselves and they just want to be druggie, should the state allow that, they are not trading drugs and harming others? Howevwe in reality, that person is not isolated, he will definitel have impact on others.</p>\n\n<p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">2. State can interfere in self-regarding situations like that of a drug-addict, suicidal person etc if we can show that their decision is encumbered. Really encumbered<em> (so much that they can&#39;t reason for themselves) </em>like dog-drunk, crazy etc.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">3. Your freedom might be curtailed if it interferes with freedom of others. But the majorities cannot use this argument to say that some minority who is opposing is attacking their freedom; simply because they don&#39;t need protection of their freedom, they are already in majority. <span style=\"color:#8e44ad;\"><em>[But, they won&#39;t remain majority if they allow it!] </em></span>Even the most whacko ideas need to be heard in a free society.</p>\n\n<p>[<em>&quot;Rich and poor are equally free to sleep under the bridges&quot;</em> - This french joke highlights the thinness of the concept of freedom.

A person who is devoid of these basic necessities has no obligation to follow any moral code, whether it is divine or man-made. A man could be called Transcendent if he is capable of adhering to some moral code despite the&nbsp;destitute condition of being&nbsp;devoid of these basic things.&nbsp;</em></span></p>\n\n<p>What should a person (who&nbsp;thinks at the level of humanity, and is compassionate to everyone) do, when he&nbsp; is to decide whether he should participate in nationalistic fight or not?</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp; <em>(This question can be framed in many ways with two different contexts which are at conflict with each other).</em></p>\n\n<p>What about situations where moral evaluations have conflict i.e. we have more than one possible alternatives to do the right thing? Many examples have been presented in movies and novels. One which is not unrealistic is the following: -</p>\n\n<p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">During the times of some war in which your country is trying to protect itself, all your friends are nominating themselves for the war. Your mother is sick at home, and you know that if you leave her and go to war, she would die. What moral choice would you make?</p>\n\n<p>The core process that life uses is <strong><u>survival and continuation of the self.</u></strong> And living entities do whatever they do to carry out that process only*. So, where does the question of right and wrong come from?</p>\n\n<p><em>(But what happens when one gets past the problem of physical survival. Probably, then comes the problem of &quot;Ideal survival&quot;, why do people even care about being remembered after they die?)</em></p>\n\n<p>The highest images of morality demand to overcome this fundamental process of survival. Is morality about winning over this core, fundamental process employed by life? - If yes, then why, how does it make any sense at all?</p>\n\n<p>Each of our actions has some result. The result can be good, bad, somewhat good, somewhat bad on some level. In a chaotic system, a small action, seemingly&nbsp; insignificant, can cause a major result good or bad. How far should the effect of our actions be considered? Is it the sum-total of the effects of actions till the time, that determines whether we are moral or not? If that is the case, first of all it is beyond one&#39;s capability to calculate the actual result of one&#39;s actions in a chaotic system, in fact it is impossible if we do the maths. Second, you are then going to in the direction of Consequentialism. <strong><em>Does the intention not matter regardless of the results?</em></strong></p>\n\n<p>Is it about finding a good balance of the consequences of our actions?</p>\n\n<p>Is conforming to the society, social rituals, norms is what morality is about?</p>\n\n<p>How much should the emotional consequences weigh in? There are people of all kinds, how much should the actions be accounted for while considering the moral standard?</p>\n\n<p>If morality prevents personal freedom, and personal well-being in turn, should it still be taken seriously? How do we find the balance, when each of our actions have not only effect on ourselves, but on others as well as the collective (society)?</p>\n\n<p>If a person does not &quot;know&quot; that the action is wrong, is it still wrong? It sure might have negative consequences, but is it wrong though if he is not aware?</p>\n\n<p>What if a person has heard about the action that it&nbsp;is considered wrong in some way, but does not believe it so, is it still wrong? - Then, what is right - one that is favoured by the most? Is majority always right? Or, is it the competition b/w schools and the one who wins (asserts more successfully, infests most population) is morally correct?</p>\n\n<p>What about this:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Nothing is wrong in itself, nothing is right in itself. You should do whatever you want, whatever makes you happy. (<span jsslot=\"\"><span data-dobid=\"hdw\">carte blanche)</span></span></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>It <em>can</em> have some greatly negative consequences. No rule means anarchy.</p>\n\n<p>Maybe it makes you happy, but brings negative consequences (suffering) to others. The question is - how much should other people tolerate these negative consequences to allow you to make yourself happy? You say who is the judge? - The social consciousness itself is the judge, it will manifest in way or the other.</p>\n\n<p>Does the intention matter, or does the consequence only matter in deciding the morality of an action?</p>\n\n<p>How much should the situation, context be weighed in while considering some action moral or immoral? And what kind of situations?</p>\n\n<p>What if I choose from possible set of actions, the one that is Lesser Evil? Is that moral? - Who decides that possible set of actions, and how much effort should you put in before finalizing that set?</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samaritan%27s_dilemma\">Samaritan&#39;s Dillemma</a> - Is charity really moral, because it can potentially make the recipient slothful?</p>\n\n<p>What about the situations when the virtues enact give rise to conflict e.g. between loyality to family members and duty to the larger community? - Socrates discusses this in<em> Euthyphro</em>.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>https://www.csus.edu/indiv/c/chalmersk/econ184sp09/johnrawls.pdf</p>\n\n<p>Theories of Distributive Justice:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/libertarianism/\" target=\"_blank\">Libertarian</a> - Free-market.
