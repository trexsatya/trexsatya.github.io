For development of Science in East compared to West, see <a href=\"https://www.jstor.org/stable/40401068?seq=1#metadata_info_tab_contents\">here</a>.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thales_of_Miletus\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Thales</strong></a> was probably the first one known to have enquired into Nature in the Western world. Thales is said to have predicted an eclipse of the sun that occurred in 585 B.C.</p>\n\n<p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\"><em><span style=\"color:#16a085;\">The idea that&nbsp; everything is made from some single thing was revolutionary. For Thales it was Water, everything&nbsp;was made from water, and things&nbsp;just change (e.g. Water&nbsp;&rarr; Air &rarr; Water &rarr; Rock ) from one form to another, water is neither created nor&nbsp;destroyed. Before Thales, everything was thought to be done&nbsp; by Agency of Gods. Agency instead of&nbsp; Process was prime cause of everything.&nbsp; </span></em></p>\n\n<p>Anaximanders modified Thale&#39;s ideas: Water cannot be conserved because as soon as water is&nbsp;transformed, it is no&nbsp;longer water. He replaced water with an abstract entity <em>indefinite</em>. Also, he rejected Thale&#39;s idea that the earth stands on water, floating like a log of wood. He said that nothing holds Earth, it is at the center, so no need&nbsp;to move it.&nbsp; He said shape of the earth is&nbsp;cylindrical. He viewed heavenly bodies as spheres&nbsp;turning around the Earth, having&nbsp;vents through which fire can&nbsp;come out. Somehow the vents open up&nbsp;and&nbsp;close resulting in Eclipses and phases of moon.</p>\n\n<p>Philolaus took abstraction further. He said <em>unlimiteds</em> and <em>limiters</em>&nbsp;when combined in harmony make universe as well as everything in it. <em>Unlimiteds</em> are substances, <em>limiters</em> are shapes.</p>\n\n<p>Parmenides reasoned that everything is eternal, unchanging, we are deluded by our senses.&nbsp;Anaxagoras relaxed&nbsp;his idea a bit, nothing really comes into existence or perishes, but things appear and disappear from a certain process. His idea was that initially everything was mixed with everything&nbsp;else. There was a special thing Mind (apart from mixture,&nbsp; pure) which&nbsp;started rotation of&nbsp;the mixture. This caused similar bits of things to combine and give appearance to forms of things we see including animals.</p>\n\n<p>So, if mixture is separated (by rotation), then all things of same type should be limped together. But that&#39;s not what we see. Empedocles suggested that after complete seaparation, things go back towards perfect mixture. The world that we see is in-between. Also, rotation can only give separation not mixture, so separation is due to Strife and mixture is due to Love. Also, there are only four basic things out of which everything is made of (by combining in proportion): Earth, Water, Air and Fire. <em>[This view was also held in Indian philosophers]</em></p>\n\n<p>Leucippus and his student Democritus brought in the idea of <em><strong>Atoms</strong></em> &mdash; indivisible bodies. They reached this idea purely by reasoning (by contradiction). Atoms and empty space (void) make all things that we see. They held the view that these atoms have only two basic properties - size and shape. Every other property position, motion, arrangement, color, taste etc were explained in terms of basic properties. <span style=\"color:#27ae60;\"><em>[This is also a big step]. They agreed with&nbsp;</em></span>Parmenides<span style=\"color:#27ae60;\"><em> in the sense that Atoms do not change. But since Atoms can move, their separation causes decay and combination causes new things into existence.</em></span></p>\n\n<p>Euclid combined the mathematical work done by his predecessors in an organized form, and set the foundations for modern Geometry. He introduced concepts of Definitions, Postulates/Axioms/Common notions (things assumed without proof in general), Propositions &mdash; Problems (something that needs to be done, <em>proof ended by Q.E.F</em>), Theorems (something that needs to be demonstrated, <em>proof ended by Q.E.D</em>). These Propositions are proved based solely on the definitions and Postulates. Previously proved propositions can be used to prove new propositions.</p>\n\n<p>Plato explained things by reason, he held Reasoning (by dialectics) truer than opinions formed by (sensory) observation. Plato assigned the source of existence to a Creator. He held the view that Eath is spherical (because sphere shape embraces within itself all the shapes there are, Euclid&#39;s book demonstrates this with five regular polyhedra). This was core to Plato&#39;s approach, since the Creator would only create that which is best, we can know the shape of earth (and other things) by knowing what is best. Plato associated four basic things (fire, air, earth, and water) with four regular polyhedra according to what suits best their nature. He further noted that polyhedra&#39;s faces are composed of triangles, so the change from one thing into another can be explained by separation and combinations of these fundamental triangles. E.g. Earth was supposed to be most immobile, and most pliable, hence cube suited it. Plato also held the view that whole creation had soul and intelligence.</p>\n\n<hr />\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aristotle\" title=\"Aristotle\">Aristotle</a> developed ideas about a lot of aspects of nature which can be called <strong><em>Physics</em></strong> (which comes from Greek word phusis [=nature]). Aristote brough in Logics and concepts like Deduction, Induction.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>We think we understand a thing simpliciter. . .&nbsp; whenever we think we are aware both that the explanation because of which the object is is its explanation, and that it is not possible for this to be otherwise. [70b9]</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Now whether there is also another type of understanding we shall say later; but we say now that we do know through demonstration. By demonstration I mean a scientific deduction; and by scientific I mean one in virtue of which, byhaving it, we understand something.[70b17]</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><em>Do we really understand anything?</em></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<ul>\n\t<li>P1.&nbsp; Demonstration must start from premises that aren&rsquo;t demonstrated; otherwise demonstration couldn&rsquo;t get started.</li>\n\t<li>P2.&nbsp; To have understanding by demonstration we must understand the premises.</li>\n\t<li>P3.&nbsp; Demonstration is the only way of having understanding.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>P1, P2 are correct. But P3 is false. We say that neither is all understanding demonstrative, but in the case of the immediates it is non-demonstrable. [172b19] - Aristotle</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Principles, and General Laws are understood by Art which comes through Experience of perceptions.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Thus it is clear that it is necessary for us to become familiar with the primitives by induction; for perception too instils the universal in this way. [100b4</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><em>Can we explain everything (by demonstration)?</em></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Of accidentals which do not belong to things in themselves . . .there is no demonstrative understanding.For one cannot prove theconclusion from necessity; for it is possible for what is accidental not to belong&mdash;for that is the sort of accidental I am talking about. Yet one might perhaps puzzle about what aim we shouldhave in asking these questions about them, if it is not necessary forthe conclusion to be the case.[75a18]</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>We must ask not as though the conclusion were necessary becauseof what was asked, but because it is necessary for anyone who says them to say it, and to say it truly if they truly hold.[75a18]</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>&nbsp;We can explain accidentals by Deduction, although it is not Demonstration.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>A deduction is an argument in which, certain things being laiddown, something other than these necessarily comes about through them.It is a demonstration, when the premisses from which the deduction starts are true and primitive, or are such that our knowledge of them has originally come through premisses which are primitive and true;and it is a dialectical deduction, if it reasons from reputable opinions.[100a25]</p>\n\n<p>Those opinions are reputable which are accepted by everyone or by the majority or by the wise&mdash;i.e. by all, or by the majority, or by the most notable and reputable of them.[100b22]</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>A definition is a phrase signifying a thing&rsquo;s essence.[102a1] Like, <em>man is a rational animal.</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>A property is something which does not indicate the essence of a thing, but yet belongs to that thing alone, and ispredicated convertibly of it.[102a18]</p>\n\n<p>Thus it is a property of man to be capable of learning grammar; for if he is a man, then he is capable of learning grammar, and if he is capable of learning grammar, he is a man.[102a20]</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>A genus is what is predicated in what a thing is of a number of things exhibiting differences in kind.[102a31]</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>&ldquo;Predicated in what a thing is&rdquo; means it is essential, i.e., part of the definition of the thing.</p>\n\n<p>Example: Man is animal, essentially. Ox is also animal, essentially. So &ldquo;animal&rdquo; is a genus of man (and of ox).</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>An accident is something which, though it is none of the foregoing&mdash;i.e. neither a definition nor a property nor a genus&mdash;yet belongs to the thing; and something which may either belong or not belong to any one and the self- same thing, as (e.g.)&nbsp; being seated may belong or not belong to some self-same thing. Likewise also whiteness; for there is nothing to prevent the same thing being at one time white and at another not white.[102b4]</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Aristotle&#39;s idea of change: There&#39;s something that persists through change, and there&#39;s something that changes from one opposite (or intermediate) to other opposite. E.g. a man becomes musical from unmusical. An unformed bronze becomes statue.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>If . . . the movement of the rotating bodies about the centre is unnatural, it would be remarkable and indeed quite inconceivable that this movement alone should be continuous and eternal, given that it is unnatural. At any rate the evidence of all other cases goes to show that it is the unnatural which quickest passes away . . . Therefore, we may infer with confidence that there is something beyond the bodies that are about us on this earth, different and separate from them; and that the superior glory of its nature is proportionate to its distance from this world of ours. [269b6]</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>So, according to Aristotle, heavenly bodies motion is natural, because it is continuous and eternal. The motions on earth are quickest to stop, hence unnatural. Counterarguments could be - Heavenly bodies motion is not eternal, they initially didn&#39;t move.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Existence of elements:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>An element . . . is a body into which other bodies may be analysed, present in them potentially or in actuality . . . , and not itself divisible into bodies different in form. [302a15]</p>\n\n<p>Now if what we have described is an element, clearly there must be such bodies. For flesh and wood and all other similar bodies contain potentially fire and earth, since one sees these elements exuded from them; and, on the other hand, neither in potentiality nor in actuality does fire contain flesh or wood, or it would exude them. [302a20]</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Counterargument could be:&nbsp;Fire and earth do contain flesh and wood, and exude them. E.g., when a tree grows, that occurs because wood is exuded from fire and earth. Aristotle denies this but gives no reason to support his view.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>If every element has its proper movement, and a simple body has a simple movement, and the number of simple motions is not infinite, because the simple motions are only two and the number of places is not infinite, on these grounds also we should have to deny that the number of elements is infinite. [303b3]</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Counterargument could be:&nbsp;Aristotle may be assuming that different elements must have different natural motions. But that is inconsistent with his own view, since he believes earth and water have the same natural motion (straight down).</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>The elements . . . cannot be eternal. It is a matter of observation that fire, water, and every simple body undergo a process of analysis [i.e., destruction]. [304b23]</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Counterargument could be:&nbsp;when we see water evaporate, we don&rsquo;t see water turn into air; we just see the water vanish. This is due to water mixing into the air and becoming invisible because the mixture is mostly air [as per&nbsp;Anaxagoras]</p>\n\n<p>Aristotle distinguished Natural Things from other things. Natural Things are those, in which the cause of Motion (3 types &mdash; change in place, growth and decrease, alteration/mutation) comes from within.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Nature is a principle or cause of being moved and of being atrest in that to which it belongs primarily, in virtue of itself and not accidentally.[192b21]</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>The four causes (Physics II 3, 194b24)</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<ol>\n\t<li>In one way, then, that out of which a thing comes to be and which persists, is called a cause, e.g.&nbsp; the bronze of the statue, the silver of the bowl. (Material cause.)</li>\n\t<li>In another way, the form or the archetype, i.e.&nbsp; the definition of the essence, and its genera, are called causes (e.g.&nbsp; of the octave the relation of 2:1, and generally number), and the parts in the definition. (Formal cause.)</li>\n\t<li>Again, the primary source of the change or rest; e.g.&nbsp; the man who deliberated is a cause, the father is cause of the child,and generally what makes of what is made and what changes of what is changed. (Efficient cause.)</li>\n\t<li>Again, in the sense of end or that for the sake of which a thing is done, e.g.&nbsp; health is the cause of walking about.&nbsp; (&lsquo;Why is he walking about?&rsquo;&nbsp; We say:&nbsp; &lsquo;To be healthy&rsquo;, and, having said that, we think we have assigned the cause.) (Final cause.)</li>\n</ol>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Aristotle&#39;s dialectic regarding Physics and heavenly bodies was a critique of Anaxagoras, and it&#39;s amusing that even though Aristotle laid out perfectly the rules of Logic, he failed to apply them in many places in his critique.</p>\n\n<hr />\n<blockquote>\n<p>Only mathematics can provide sure and unshakeable knowledge to its devotees,provided one approaches it rigorously. For its kind of proofproceeds by indisputable methods, namely arithmetic and geometry. - Ptolemy</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Ptolemy said that Earth is spherical, not purely based on reason, instead based on observations. By observing lunar eclipses being recorded at different times (the difference being proprtional to distance between places) in East and West he concluded that Earth curves uniformly east-west. By observing that when travelling north, more of southern stars disappear and northern stars appear, he concluded that Earth curves uniformly north-west. Hence spherical.</p>\n\n<p>Ptolemy also thought that the heavens are spherical. And the Earth is at the center. And that the size of Earth is negligible compared to heavens. The Earth doesn&#39;t move, since it is at the center. <a href=\"http://patrick.maher1.net/317/lectures/ptolemy2.pdf\">[17]</a>, <a href=\"http://patrick.maher1.net/317/lectures/cope1.pdf\">[18]</a></p>\n\n<p>If all planets along with Sun move around Earth, why is there difference in their motion, their speed and sometimes even direction? Ptolemy described it by introducing Epicycle and Eccentric paths for planets.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Building upon a naturalistic, empirical method pioneered by&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aristotle\" title=\"Aristotle\">Aristotle</a>&nbsp;in ancient Greece, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ibn_al-Haytham\" target=\"_blank\">Ibn al-Haytham</a> was an early proponent of the concept that a hypothesis must be supported by experiments based on confirmable procedures or mathematical evidence.</p>\n\n<p>Ibn al-Hayaham developed theories, mathematics,&nbsp;experiments regarding optics and vision. He also developed Aristotle&#39;s work in more formal method of&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%20Analysis\" target=\"_blank\">Analysis</a>&nbsp;(<em>Breaking up a complex topic or substance into smaller parts in order to gain understanding of the substance</em>). Today it is formally applied in all aspects of life and science: Business, Computer Science, Economics, Engineering, Mathematics, Statistics, Logic, Psychology etc.</p>\n\n<p>Hayaham is also known for&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%20Scientific_method\" target=\"_blank\">Scientific_method</a>&nbsp;(Which can be summarised as: <strong><em>&quot;Observe carefully, doubt rigorously of all your conclusions, formulate hypothesis by inductional reasoning on your observations, do experiments, make deductions from hypothesis, validate those deductions, refine or eliminate the hypothesis if required&quot;</em></strong>) These steps are followed in different order and magnitude depending on the contexts.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>When you have multiple theories/hypothesises, you choose one which best explains the results/observations. &quot;Best&quot; is an abstract term here.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roger_Bacon\" target=\"_blank\">Roger Bacon</a> applied the empirical method of&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ibn_al-Haytham\" title=\"Ibn al-Haytham\">Ibn al-Haytham</a>&nbsp;(Alhazen) to observations in texts attributed to&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aristotle\" title=\"Aristotle\">Aristotle</a>. Bacon discovered the importance of empirical testing when the results he obtained were different than those that would have been predicted by Aristotle.<sup id=\"cite_ref-FOOTNOTEAckerman1978119_8-0\"><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roger_Bacon#cite_note-FOOTNOTEAckerman1978119-8\">[7]</a></sup><sup id=\"cite_ref-9\"><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roger_Bacon#cite_note-9\">[8]</a></sup>&nbsp;(Aristotle had never performed experiments to verify his explanations of his observations of nature.)</p>\n\n<p>Rober Bacon started what is called as<strong>&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experimental_science\" target=\"_blank\">Experimental_science</a>&nbsp;</strong>-<em> a procedure to support, refute, validate a hypothesis. Also, regarding investigation into cause and effect of phenomena, by manipulating the factors involved. The experiment must be repeatable, reviewable, and then a logical conclusion is made.</em></p>\n\n<hr />\n<h2>Development of Astronomy</h2>\n\n<p>Till Ptolemy and many others who studied based on the ideas similar to him believed that Earth was at center and other heavenly bodies moved around it.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicolaus_Copernicus\">Copernicus</a> was first to bring a major breakthrough in it. He stated that The sun isat rest in the center; the earth rotates on its axis once/day andorbits the sun once/year. <em>[BTW, this idea and the period around it caused real struggle for Western Science against Church]</em></p>\n\n<p>See the history of astronomy <a href=\"https://casswww.ucsd.edu/archive/public/tutorial/History.html\">here</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Over the centuries people had observed stars, planets (which they named after Gods), their motion&#39;s cycle, path, trajectory.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eratosthenes\">Eratosthenes</a> and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Posidonius\">Posidonius</a> are known to have calculated circumference of Earth. <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hipparchus\">Hipparchus</a> calculated distances to the Sun and Moon, and found precession of equinoxes (Earth&#39;s rotation axis) incidentally.</p>\n\n<p>A great thing Ptolemy did was give a mathematical model to explain planetory motion. Later on when people used that model to predict observations, and found that observations didn&#39;t match, it demanded a paradigm shift.</p>\n\n<p>An interesting thing is that <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aristarchus_of_Samos\">Aristarchus</a> had long ago proposed, but was rejected, the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heliocentrism\">Heliocentric</a> model which later became paradigm shift in astronomy, before <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicolaus_Copernicus\">Nicolaus_Copernicus</a> worked on this to fit observations.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<hr />\n<h2>Models of Scientific Enquiry:</h2>\n\n<p><strong>Classical mode:</strong></p>\n\n<p>Started by Aristotle. Included Induction, Deduction, Abduction based inferences along with Analogies.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Hypothetico-deductive model:</strong></p>\n\n<p>Includes hypothesizing, deduction and validation of inferences.</p>\n\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_method#Pragmatic_model\" target=\"_blank\">Pragmatic model</a>:</strong></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Sanders_Peirce\" title=\"Charles Sanders Peirce\">Charles Sanders Peirce</a>&nbsp;suggested that its not about finding the truth <em>per se</em>, it&#39;s more about&nbsp;the struggle to move from irritating, inhibitory doubts born of surprises, disagreements, and the like, and to reach a secure belief, belief being that on which one is prepared to act.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Among different hypothesises, it gives priority based on efficiency, cost. The most promising, and cheapest should be used to proceed enquiry.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>One theory can subsume another theory: E.g. Einstein&#39;s Theory of General Relativity subsumed Newton&#39;s Theory because it explained all that Newton&#39;s theory explained and many other things.</p>\n\n<p>An example of how the steps of Scientific Discovery were conducted in case of DNA Structure Discover: <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_method#DNA_example\" target=\"_blank\">Wikipedia</a></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.helsinki.fi/tint/matti/kiikeri.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">How Kepler used Abduction to discover Ellipse</a>. <a href=\"https://www.collectionscanada.gc.ca/obj/s4/f2/dsk3/ftp04/nq28506.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">Kepler&#39;s discovery</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Sometimes (not always) defining terms or doubting our knowledge of some basic elements can lead to new discoveries: E.g.&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert_Einstein\" title=\"Albert Einstein\">Albert Einstein</a>&#39;s first paper on&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_relativity\" title=\"Special relativity\">relativity</a>&nbsp;begins by defining&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relativity_of_simultaneity\" title=\"Relativity of simultaneity\">simultaneity</a>&nbsp;and the means for determining&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Length\" title=\"Length\">length</a>.

An apparently arbitrary element, compounded of personal and historical accident, is always a formative ingredient of the beliefs espoused by a given scientific community at a given time.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Normal science, the activity in which most scientists inevitably spend almost all their time, is predicated on the assumption that the scientific community knows what the world is like. Much of the success of the enterprise derives from the community&#39;s willingness to defend that assumption, if ncessary at considerable cost. Normal science, for example, often suppresses fundamental novelties because they are necessaryily subversive of its basic commitments. Neverthless, so long as those commitments retain an element of the arbitrary, the very nature of normal research ensures that novelty shall not be suppressed for very long.</p>\n\n<p>Paradigms are the achievements that have two characteristics:</p>\n\n<p>It is sufficiently unprecedented to attract an enduring group of adherents away from competing modes of scientific activity.<br />\nSimultaneously, it was sufficiently open-ended to leave all sorts of problems for the redefined group of practitioners to resolve.<br />\nExamples:</p>\n\n<p>Development of Optics:</p>\n\n<p>There were many competing groups trying to describe&nbsp;the nature of light before Newton, most of them espousing one variant or another of Epicurean, Aristotelian, or Platonic theory. One group took light to be particles emanating from material bodies; for another it was a modification of the medium that intervened between the body and the eye; still another explained light in terms of an interaction of the medium with an emanation from the eye; and there other combinations and modifications besides. Each of the corresponding schools derived strength from its relation to some particular metaphysic, and each emphaiszed, as paradigmatic observations, the particular cluster of optical phenomena that its own theory could do most to explain. Other observations were dealt with by ad hoc elaborations, or they remained as outstanding problems for further research.</p>\n\n<p>The&nbsp;intromission theory {Aristotle, Galen} and the&nbsp;emission theory&nbsp;&nbsp;{Plato, , Epicurus, Democritus}.&nbsp;\u27f6 Geometrical Optics&nbsp;by {Euclid}&nbsp;&nbsp;\u27f6.&nbsp;&nbsp;combined both theories {Ptolemy}&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\u27f6. modification of emmission theory, light is emmitted from object itself rather than eyes {Alhazen}&nbsp;&nbsp;\u27f6.&nbsp;&nbsp;..... Alzahen&#39;s work was largely ignored in Arab countries, but it was anonymously translated into Latin around 1200 A.D. and further summarised and expanded on by the Polish monk&nbsp;Witelo[18]&nbsp;making it a standard text on optics in Europe for the next 400 years.[19].....&nbsp;&nbsp;\u27f6.&nbsp;Bacon was able to use parts of glass spheres as&nbsp;magnifying glasses&nbsp;to demonstrate that light reflects from objects rather than being released from them.&nbsp;&nbsp;\u27f6&nbsp;The first wearable eyeglasses were invented in Italy around 1286.[21]&nbsp;\u27f6.&nbsp;invention of the compound&nbsp;optical microscope&nbsp;around 1595, and the&nbsp;refracting telescope&nbsp;in 1608, both of which appeared in the spectacle making centres in the Netherlands.[26][27]&nbsp;\u27f6 In the early 17th century, Johannes Kepler expanded on geometric optics \u27f6 Descarte&#39;s&nbsp;corpuscle theory of light&nbsp;\u27f6 Newton expanded on this idea&nbsp;&nbsp;\u27f6.&nbsp;In 1690,&nbsp;Christiaan Huygens&nbsp;proposed a&nbsp;wave theory&nbsp;for light based on suggestions that had been made by&nbsp;Robert Hooke&nbsp;in 1664. Hooke himself publicly criticised Newton&#39;s theories of light and the feud between the two lasted until Hooke&#39;s death. In 1704, Newton published&nbsp;Opticks&nbsp;and, at the time, partly because of his success in other areas of physics, he was generally considered to be the victor in the debate over the nature of light.[30]&nbsp;\u27f6&nbsp;early 19th century when&nbsp;Thomas Young&nbsp;and&nbsp;Augustin-Jean Fresnel&nbsp;conducted experiments on the&nbsp;interference&nbsp;of light that firmly established light&#39;s wave nature.&nbsp;\u27f6&nbsp;Wave optics was successfully unified with&nbsp;electromagnetic theory&nbsp;by&nbsp;James Clerk Maxwell&nbsp;in the 1860s&nbsp;&nbsp;\u27f6&nbsp;in 1899 when&nbsp;Max Planck&nbsp;correctly modelled&nbsp;blackbody radiation&nbsp;by assuming that the exchange of energy between light and matter only occurred in discrete amounts he called&nbsp;quanta.[33]&nbsp;\u27f6&nbsp;In 1905,&nbsp;Albert Einstein&nbsp;published the theory of the&nbsp;photoelectric effect&nbsp;that firmly established the quantization of light itself.[34][35]&nbsp;&nbsp;\u27f6 This further led the development of Quantum Mechanics overall.</p>\n\n<p>The history of electrical research in the first half of the eighteenth century provides a more concrete and better known example of the way a science develops before it acquires its first universally received paradigm.</p>\n\n<p>During that period there were almost as many views about the nature of electricity as there were important electrical experimenters&nbsp;-they were partially derived from one or an&nbsp;other version of the mechanico-corpuscular philosophy that guided all scientific research of the day.&nbsp;Yet though all the experiments were electrical and though most of the experimenters read each other&#39;s works, their theories had no more than a family resemblance.&nbsp;One early group of theories, following seventeenth-century practice, regarded attraction and frictional generation as the fundamental electrical phenomena. This group tended to treat repulsion as a secondary effect due to some sort of mechanical rebounding and also to postpone for as long as possible both discussion and systematic research on Gray&#39;s newly discovered effect, electrical conduction.&nbsp;Other &quot;electricians&quot; (the term is their own) took attraction and repulsion to be equally elementary manifestations of electricity and modified their theories and research accordingly. (Actually, this group is remarkably small-even Franklin&#39;s theory never quite accounted for the mutual repulsion of two negatively charged bodies.) But they had as much difficulty as the first group in accounting simultaneously for any but the simplest conduction effects. Those effects, however, provided the starting point for still a third group, one which tended to speak of electricity as a &quot;fluid&quot; that could run through conductors rather than as an &quot;efHuvium&quot; that emanated from non-conductors. This group, in its turn, had difficulty reconciling its theory with a number of attractive and&nbsp;repulsive effects. Only through the work of Franklin and his immediate successors did a theory arise that could account with something like equal facility for very nearly all these effects and that therefore could and did provide a subsequent generation of &quot;electricians&quot; with a common paradigm for its research.</p>\n\n<p>History suggests that the road to a finn research consensus is extraordinarily arduous.</p>\n\n<p>Because the crafts are one readily accessible source of facts that could not have been casually discovered, technology&nbsp;has often played a vital role in the emergence of new sciences.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>The Baconian &quot;histories&quot; of heat, color, wind, mining, and so on, are filled with information, some of it recondite. But they juxtapose facts that will later prove revealing ( e.g., heating by mixture ) with others ( e.g., the warmth of dung heaps ) that will for some time remain too complex to be integrated with theory at all.</p>\n\n<p>Almost none of the early &quot;histories&quot; of electricity, for example, mention that chaff, attracted to a rubbed glass rod, bounces off again. That effect seemed mechanical, not electrical.G</p>\n\n<p>No natural history can be interpreted in the absence of at least some implicit body&nbsp;of intertwined theoretical and methodological belief that permits selection, evaluation, and criticism. If that body of belief is not already implicit in the collection of facts-in which case more than &quot;mere facts&quot; are at hand-it must be externally supplied, perhaps by a current metaphysic, by another science, or by personal and historical accident. No wonder, then, that in the early stages of the development of any science different men confronting the same range of phenomena, but not usually all the same particular phenomena, describe and interpret them in different ways. What is surprising, and perhaps also unique in its degree to the fields we call science, is that such initial divergences should ever largely disappear.&nbsp;Those electricians who thought electricity a fiuid and therefore gave particular emphasis to conduction provide an excellent case in point. Led by this belief, which could scarcely cope with the known multiplicity of attractive and repulsive effects, several of them conceived the idea of bottling the electrical fluid. The immediate fruit of their efforts was the Leyden jar, a device which might never have been discovered by a man exploring nature casually or at random, but which was in fact independently developed by at least two investigators in the early 1740&#39;s.7 Almost from the start of his electrical researches, Franklin was particularly concerned to explain that strange and, in the event, particularly revealing piece of special apparatus. His success in doing so provided the most effective of the arguments that made his theory a paradigm, though one that was still unable to account for quite all the known cases of electrical repulsion.</p>\n\n<p>What the fluid theory of electricity did for the subgroup that held it, the Franklinian paradigm later did for the entire group of electricians. It suggested which experiments would be worth performing and which, because directed to secondary or to overly complex manifestations of electricity, would not. Only the paradigm did the job far more effectively, partly because the end of interschool debate ended the constant reiteration of fundamentals and partly because the confidence that they were on the right track encouraged scientists to undertake more precise, esoteric, and consuming sorts of work.9 Freed from the concern with any and all electrical phenomena, the united group of electricians could pursue selected phenomena in far more detail, designing much special equipment for the task and employing it more stubbornly and systematically than electricians had ever done before. Both fact collection and theory articulation became highly directed activities. The effectiveness and efficiency of electrical research increased accordingly, providing evidence for a societal version of Francis Bacon&#39;s acute methodological dictum: &quot;Truth emerges more readily from error than from confusion.&quot;10</p>\n\n<p>When the individual scientist can take a paradigm for granted, he need no longer, in his major works, attempt to build his field anew, starting from first principles and justifying the use of each concept introduced. That can be left to the writer of textbooks. Given a textbook, however, the creative scientist can begin his research where it leaves off and thus concentrate exclusively upon the subtlest and most esoteric aspects of the natural phenomena that concern his group. And as he does this, his research communiques will begin to change in ways whose evolution has been too little studied but whose modern end products are obvious to all and oppressive to many.&nbsp;No longer will his researches usually be embodied in books addressed, like Franklin&#39;s Experiments ... on Electricity or Darwin&#39;s Origin of Species, to anyone who might be interested in the subject matter of the field. Instead they will usually appear as brief articles addressed only to professional colleagues, the men whose knowledge of a shared paradigm can be assumed and who prove to be the only ones able to read the papers addressed to them.</p>\n\n<p>In the absence of a paradigm or some candidate for a paradigm, all of the facts that could possibly pertain to development of a given science are likely to seem equally relevant. As a result, early fact-gathering is a far more nearly random actvity than the one that subsequent scientific development makes familiar. Furthermore, in the absence of a reason for seeking some particular form of more recondite information, early fact-gathering is usually restricted to the wealth of data that lie ready to hand.</p>\n\n<p>The Baconian &quot;histories&quot; of heat, color, wind, mining, and so on, are filled with information, some of it recondite. But they juxtapose facts that will later prove reveal&shy; ing ( e.g., heating by mixture ) with others ( e.g., the warmth of dung heaps ) that will for some time remain too complex to be integrated with theory at all.</p>\n\n<p>In addition, since any description must be partial, the typical natural history often omits from its immensely circumstantial accounts just those details that later scientists will find sources of important illumination. Almost none of the early &quot;histories&quot; of electricity, for example, mention that chaff, attracted to a rubbed glass rod, bounces off again. That effect seemed mechanical, not electrical.</p>\n\n<p>No wonder, then, that in the early stages of the development of any science different men confronting the same range of phenomena, but not usually all the same particular phenomena, describe and interpret them in different ways. What is surprising, and perhaps also unique in its degree to the fields we call science, is that such initial diver&shy; gences should ever largely disappear.</p>\n\n<p>Furthermore, their disappearance is usually caused by the triumph of one of the pre-paradigm schools, which, because of its own characteristic beliefs and pre&shy; conceptions, emphasized only some special part of the too siz&shy; able and inchoate pool of information.</p>\n\n<p>Those electricians who thought electricity a fiuid and therefore gave particular empha&shy; sis to conduction provide an excellent case in point. Led by this belief, which could scarcely cope with the known multiplicity of attractive and repulsive effects, several of them conceived the idea of bottling the electrical fluid. The immediate fruit of their efforts was the Leyden jar, a device which might never have been discovered by a man exploring nature casually or at ran&shy; dom, but which was in fact independently developed by at least two investigators in the early 1740&#39;s.7 Almost from the start of his electrical researches, Franklin was particularly concerned to explain that strange and, in the event, particularly revealing piece of special apparatus. His success in doing so provided the most effective of the arguments that made his theory a para&shy;digm, though one that was still unable to account for quite all the known cases of electrical repulsion.</p>\n\n<p>The effectiveness and efficiency of electrical research increased accordingly, pro&shy; viding evidence for a societal version of Francis Bacon&#39;s acute methodological dictum: &quot;Truth emerges more readily from error than from confusion.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>Today in the sciences, books arc usually either texts or retro&shy; spective reflections upon one aspect or another of the scientific life. No longer will his researches usually be embodied in books ad&shy; dressed, like Franklin&#39;s Experiments . . . on Electricity or Dar&shy; win&#39;s Origin of Species, to anyone who might be interested in the subject matter of the field.</p>\n\n<p>Both in mathematics and astronomy, research reports had ceased already in antiquity to be intelligible to a generally educated audience. In dynamics, research became similarly esoteric in the later Middle Ages, and it recaptured general intelligibility only briefly during the early seventeenth century when a new paradigm replaced the one that had guided medieval research.&nbsp;Electrical research began to require translation for the layman before the end of the eighteenth century, and most other fields of physical science ceased to be generally accessible in the nineteenth.&nbsp;Although it has become customary, and is surely proper, to deplore the widening gulf that separates the professional scientist from his colleagues in other fields, too little attention is paid to the essential relationship between that gulf and the mechanisms intrinsic to scientific advance.</p>\n\n<p>Normal Science consists in actualization of promises of success discoverable in selected and still incomplete examples, an actualization achieved by extending the knowledge of those facts that the paradigm displays as particularly revealing, by increasing the extent of the match between those facts and paradigm&#39;s predictions, and by further articulation of the paradigm itself.</p>\n\n<p>The success of a paradigm-whether Aristotle&#39;s analysis of motion, Ptolemy&#39;s computations of planetary position, Lavoisier&#39;s application of the balance, or Maxwell&#39;s mathematization of the electromagnetic field-is at the start largely a promise of success discoverable in selected and&nbsp;still incomplete examples. Normal science consists in the actualization of that promise, an actualization achieved by extending the knowledge of those facts that the paradigm displays as particularly revealing, by increasing the extent of the match between those facts and the paradigm&#39;s predictions, and by further articulation of the paradigm itself.<br />\nThe areas investigated by normal science are, of course, minuscule; the enterprise now under discussion has drastically restricted vision. But those restrictions, born from confidence in a paradigm, turn out to be essential to the development of science.&nbsp;By focusing attention upon a small range of relatively esoteric problems, the paradigm forces scientists to investigate some part of nature in a detail and depth that would otherwise be unimaginable.</p>\n\n<p>From Tycho Brahe to E. 0. Lawrence, some scien&shy; tists have acquired great reputations, not from any novelty of their discoveries, but from the precision, reliability, and scope of the methods they developed for the redetermination of a previously known sort of fact.</p>\n\n<p>Special telescopes to demonstrate the Copernican prediction of annual parallax; Atwood&#39;s machine, first invented almost a cen&shy; tury after the Principia, to give the first unequivocal demonstra&shy; tion of Newton&#39;s second law; Foucault&#39;s apparatus to show that the speed of light is greater in air than in water; or the gigantic scintillation counter designed to demonstrate the existence of&nbsp;&nbsp;the neutrino-these pieces of special apparatus and many others like them illustrate the immense effort and ingenuity that have been required to bring nature and theory into closer and closer agreement.3 That attempt to demonstrate agreement is a second type of normal experimental work, and it is even more obviously dependent than the first upon a paradigm.</p>\n\n<p>The existence of the paradigm sets the problem to be solved; often the paradigm theory is implicated directly in the design of apparatus able to solve the problem. Without the Principia, for example, measurements made with the Atwood machine would have meant nothing at all.</p>\n\n<p>A third class of experiments and observations exhausts, I think, the fact-gathering activities of normal science. It consists of empirical work undertaken to articulate the paradigm theory, resolving some of its residual ambiguities and permitting the solution of problems to which it had previously only drawn attention.</p>\n\n<p>In the more mathemat&shy; ical sciences, some of the experiments aimed at articulation are directed to the determination of physical constants. Newton&#39;s work, for example, indicated that the force between two unit masses at unit distance would be the same for all types of matter at all positions in the universe. But his own problems could be solved without even estimating the size of this attraction, the universal gravitational constant; and no one else devised appa&shy; ratus able to determine it for a century after the Principia ap&shy;peared.</p>\n\n<p>Because of its central position in physical theory, improved values of the gravitational constant have been the object of repeated efforts ever since by a number of outstanding experimentalists. Other examples of the same sort of continu&shy; ing work would include determinations of the astronomical unit, Avogadro&#39;s number, Joule&#39;s coefficient, the electronic charge, and so on. Few of these elaborate efforts would have been conceived and none would have been carried out without a paradigm theory to define the problem and to guarantee the existence of a stable solution.</p>\n\n<p>Efforts to articulate a paradigm are not, however, restricted to the determination of universal constants. They may, for example, also aim at quantitative laws: Boyle&#39;s Law relating gas pressure to volume, Coulomb&#39;s Law of electrical attraction, and Joule&#39;s formula relating heat generated to electrical resistance and current are all in this category. Perhaps it is not apparent that a paradigm is prerequisite to the discovery of laws like these. We often hear that they are found by examining measure&shy; ments undertaken for their own sake and without theoretical commitment. But history offers no support for so excessively Baconian a method. Boyle&#39;s experiments were not conceivable (and if conceived would have received another interpretation or none at all) until air was recognized as an elastic fluid to which all the elaborate concepts of hydrostatics could be ap&shy; plied.&quot; Coulomb&#39;s success depended upon his constructing spe&shy; cial apparatus to measure the force between point charges. (Those who had previously measured electrical forces using ordinary pan balances, etc., had found no consistent or simple regularity at all.) But that design, in turn, depended upon the previous recognition that every particle of electric fluid acts upon every other at a distance. It was for the force between such particles-the only force which might safely be assumed&nbsp;&nbsp;a simple function of distance-that Coulomb was looking.6 Joule&#39;s experiments could also be used to illustrate how quanti&shy; tative laws emerge through paradigm articulation. In fact, so general and close is the relation between qualitative paradigm and quantitative law that, since Galileo, such laws have often been correctly guessed with the aid of a paradigm years be&shy; fore apparatus could be designed for their experimental dete1mination.</p>\n\n<p>Often a paradigm developed for one set of phenomena is ambiguous in its application to other closely related ones. Then experiments are necessary to choose among the alternative ways of applying the paradigm to the new area of interest. For example, the paradigm applications of the caloric theory were to heating and cooling by mixtures and by change of state. But heat could be released or absorbed in many other ways-e.g., by chemical combination, by friction, and by compression or absorption of a gas-and to each of these other phenomena the theory could be applied in several ways. If the vacuum had a heat capacity, for example, heating by compression could be explained as the result of mixing gas with void. Or it might be due to a change in the specific heat of gases with changing pressure. And there were several other explanations besides. Many experiments were undertaken to elaborate these various possibilities and to distinguish between them; all these experiments arose from the caloric theory as paradigm, and all exploited it in the design of experiments and in the interpretation of results. T. S. Kuhn, &quot;The Caloric Theory of Adiabatic Compression,&quot;</p>\n\n<p>Once the phe-nomenon of heating by compression had been established, all further experiments in the area were paradigm-dependent in this way. Given the phenomenon, how else could an experiment to elucidate it have been chosen?</p>\n\n<p>In applying his laws to pendulums, for example, Newton was forced to treat the bob as a mass point in order to provide a unique definition of pendulum length. Most of his theorems, the few exceptions being hypo&shy; thetical and preliminary, also ignored the effect of air resistance.</p>\n\n<p>These were sound physical approximations. Nevertheless, as approximations they restricted the agreement to be expected between Newton&#39;s predictions and actual experiments. The same difficulties appear even more clearly in the application of Newton&#39;s theory to the heavens. Simple quantitative telescopic observations indicate that the planets do not quite obey Kep&shy; ler&#39;s Laws, and Newton&#39;s theory indicates that they should not. To derive those laws, Newton had been forced to neglect all gravitational attraction except that between individual planets and the sun. Since the planets also attract each other, only approximate agreement between the applied theory and tele&shy; scopic observation could be expected. (William Whewell, History of the Inductive Sciences ( rev. cd.; London, 1847 )</p>\n\n<p>The agreement obtained was, of course, more than satisfactory to those who obtained it. Excepting for some terrestrial prob&shy; lems, no other theory could do nearly so well. None of those who questioned the validity of Newton&#39;s work did so because of its limited agreement with experiment and observation. Neverthe&shy; less, these limitations of agreement left many fascinating theo&shy; retical problems for Newton&#39;s successors. Theoretical techniques were, for example, required for treating the motions of more than two simultaneously attracting bodies and for investigating the stability of perturbed orbits. Problems like these occupied many of Europe&#39;s best mathematicians during the eighteenth and early nineteenth century. Euler, Lagrange, Laplace, and Gauss all did some of their most brilliant work on problems aimed to improve the match between Newton&#39;s paradigm and observation of the heavens. Many of these figures worked simul&shy; taneously to develop the mathematics required for applications that neither Newton nor the contemporary Continental school of mechanics had even attempted. They produced, for example, an immense literature and some very powerful mathematical tech&shy; niques for hydrodynamics and for the problem of vibrating strings. These problems of application account for what is prob&shy;ably the most brilliant and consuming scientific work of the eighteenth century.</p>\n\n<p>Other examples could be discovered by an examination of the post-paradigm period in the development of thermodynamics, the wave theory of light, electromagnetic theory, or any other branch of science whose fundamental la&#39;Ws are fully quantitative. At least in the more mathematical sciences, most theoretical work is of this sort.</p>\n\n<p>A man may be attracted to science for all sorts of reasons. Among them are the desire to be useful, the excitement of exploring new territory, the hope of finding order, and the drive to test established knowledge.</p>\n\n<p>Nevertheless, the individual engaged on a normal research problem is almost never doing any one of these things. Once engaged, his motivation is of a rather differ&shy; ent sort. What then challenges him is the conviction that, if only he is skilful enough, he will succeed in solving a puzzle that no one before has solved or solved so well.</p>\n\n<p>In short, though quantum mechanics (or New&shy; tonian dynamics, or electromagnetic theory ) is a paradigm for many scientific groups, it is not the same paradigm for them all. Therefore, it can simultaneously determine several traditions of normal science that overlap without being coextensive. A revo&shy; lution produced within one of these traditions will not neces&shy; sarily extend to the others as well.</p>\n\n<p>The late nine&shy; teenth century crisis in physics that prepared the way for the emergence of relativity theory. One root of that crisis can be traced to the late seventeenth century when a number of nat&shy; ural philosophers, most notably Leibniz, criticized Newton&#39;s retention of an updated version of the classic conception of ab&shy; solute space. (The History of Theories of Space fn Physics )</p>\n\n<p>They were very nearly, though never quite, able to show that absolute positions and absolute motions were with&shy; out any function at all in Newton&#39;s system; and they did suc&shy; ceed in hinting at the considerable aesthetic appeal a fully relativistic conception of space and motion would later come to display. But their critique was purely logical. Like the early Copemicans who criticized Aristotle&#39;s proofs of the earth&#39;s sta&shy; bility, they did not dream that transition to a relativistic system could have observational consequences. At no point did they relate their views to any problems that arose when applying Newtonian theory to nature. As a result, their views died with them during the early decades of the eighteenth century to be resurrected only in the last decades of the nineteenth when they had a very different relation to the practice of physics.</p>\n\n<p>The technical problems to which a relativistic philosophy of space was ultimately to be related began to enter normal sci&shy; ence with the acceptance of the wave theory of light after about</p>\n\n<p>1815, though they evoked no crisis until the 1890&#39;s. If light is wave motion propagated in a mechanical ether governed by Newton&#39;s Laws, then both celestial observation and terrestrial experiment become potentially capable of detecting drift through the ether. Of the celestial observations, only those of aberration promised sufficient accuracy to provide relevant in&shy; formation, and the detection of ether-drift by aberration measurements therefore became a recognized problem for nor&shy; mal research. Much special equipment was built to resolve it. That equipment, however, detected no observable drift, and&nbsp;&nbsp;the problem was therefore transferred from the experimentalists and observers to the theoreticians. During the central decades of the century Fresnel, Stokes, and others devised numerous articulations of the ether theory designed to explain the failure to observe drift. Each of these articulations assumed that a moving body drags some fraction of the ether with it. And each was sufficiently successful to explain the negative results not only of celestial observation but also of terrestrial experimenta&shy; tion, including the famous experiment of Michelson and Mor&shy; ley.11 There was still no conflict excepting that between the various articulations. In the absence of relevant experimental techniques, that conflict never became acute.</p>\n\n<p>The situation changed again only with the gradual accept&shy; ance of Maxwell&#39;s electromagnetic theory in the last two dec&shy; ades of the nineteenth century. Maxwell himself was a New&shy; tonian who believed that light and electromagnetism in general were due to variable displacements of the particles of a mechan&shy; ical ether. His earliest versions of a theory for electricity and&nbsp;&nbsp;magnetism made direct use of hypothetical properties with which he endowed this medium. These were dropped from his final version, but he still believed his electromagnetic theory compatible with some articulation of the Newtonian mechanical view.12 Developing a suitable articulation was a challenge for him and his successors. In practice, however, as has happened again and again in scientific development, the required articula&shy; tion proved immensely difficult to produce. Just as Copernicus&#39; astronomical proposal, despite the optimism of its author, created an increasing crisis for existing theories of motion, so Maxwell&#39;s theory, despite its Newtonian origin, ultimately pro&shy; duced a crisis for the paradigm from which it had sprung.13 Furthermore, the locus at which that crisis became most acute was provided by the problems we have just been considering, those of motion with respect to the ether.</p>\n\n<p>Including a Discussion of the In&shy; fluence of the Earth&#39;s Motion on Optical Phenomena (ppo 6-20, 320-220 )<br />\nMaxwell&#39;s discussion of the electromagnetic behavior of bodies in motion had made no reference to ether drag, and it proved very difficult to introduce such drag into his theory. As a result, a whole series of earlier observations designed to detect drift through the ether became anomalous. The years after 1890 therefore witnessed a long series of attempts, both experimental and theoretical, to detect motion with respect to the ether and to work ether drag into Maxwell&#39;s theory. The former were uni&shy; formly unsuccessful, though some analysts thought their results equivocal The latter produced a number of. promising starts, particularly those of Lorentz and Fitzgerald, but they also dis&shy; closed still other puzzles and finally resulted in just that prolifer&shy; ation of competing theories that we have previously found to be the concomitant of crisis.14 It is against that historical setting that Einstein&#39;s special theory of relativity emerged in 1905.</p>\n\n<p>Some say that Newtonian physics can be derived from Einstein&#39;s general relativity; so, it is not required for Newton to be wrong for Einstein to be right. But, that argument can be applied to any theory which was replaced by a new paradigm, by constraining the variables and some conditions any past theory can be derived. It also means that Einstein&#39;s theory showed only parts of Newtonian physics to be wrong, those parts which were claimed extravagantly, without evidence.</p>\n\n<p>The problem here is that it applies to all paradigmic theories, that the theory is true only for the observations for which we have valid evidence. But that is not what paradigms aim towards, otherwise there would be no surprises, no anomalies, no crisis and no paradigm shift, and hence no scientific progress. One can derive Newton&#39;s theory from Einstein&#39;s but&nbsp;&nbsp;the derivation is spurious, at least to this point. Though the Ni&#39;s are a special case of the laws of relativistic mechanics, they are not Newton&#39;s Laws. Or at least they are not unless those laws are reinterpreted in a way that would have been im&shy; possible until after Einstein&#39;s work. The variables and param&shy; eters that in the Einsteinian E/s represented spatial position, time, mass, etc., still occur in the N1&#39;s; and they there still represent Einsteinian space, time, and mass. But the physical refer&shy; ents of these Einsteinian concepts are by no means identical with those of the Newtonian concepts that bear the same name. ( Newtonian mass is conserved; Einsteinian is convertible with energy. Only at low relative velocities may the two be measured in the same way, and even then they must not be conceived to be the same. )</p>\n\n<p>Unless we change the definitions of the variables in the Nt&#39;s, the statements we have derived are not Newtonian. If we do change them, we cannot properly be said to have de&shy; rived Newton&#39;s Laws, at least not in any sense of &quot;derive&quot; now generally recognized.</p>\n\n<p>Our argument has, of course, explained why Newton&#39;s Laws ever seemed to work. In doing so it has justified, say, an automobile driver in acting as though he lived in a Newtonian universe.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"page\" title=\"Page 31\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<div class=\"page\" title=\"Page 41\">\n<div class=\"section\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<div class=\"page\" title=\"Page 42\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<div class=\"page\" title=\"Page 43\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<div class=\"page\" title=\"Page 43\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<div class=\"page\" title=\"Page 45\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<div class=\"page\" title=\"Page 46\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<div class=\"page\" title=\"Page 86\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<div class=\"page\" title=\"Page 86\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<div class=\"page\" title=\"Page 87\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<div class=\"page\" title=\"Page 116\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<div class=\"page\" title=\"Page 116\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">&nbsp;</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#8e44ad;\"><em>[So, for motivational puposes past has to be wrong; because when proposing a theory one aims towards generality, only in hindsight one can see that generality is not applicable.

Pneuma emits from our eyes, which seems to have the same effect as light of sun has, it affects the air as a continuum and spreads to the whole of it.</p>\n\n<p>This pneuma is not necessarily a substance, it is the first instrument of the soul that resides in the brain (also, it&#39;s neither the essence of the soul nor its dwelling). Pneuma is of two types: vital (in arteries) and psychic (in brain).</p>\n\n<p>Only the relevant sense instruments are altered by objects of perception e.g. luminous sense instrument is altered by colours, the airlike instrument by sounds. (<em>&quot;If sight alone has been given this exceptional ability, along with the ability to see by reflection, one may reasonably assert that it needed luminous pneumaflowing in from above which might encounter the surrounding air and strike it, as it were, and assimilate it to itself.&quot;</em>)</p>\n\n<p>For it was stated that what people call a transmission of power is a transfer of qualitative change, such as occurs also in the air by the agency of sunlight. Thus it is likely that in this way the pneumacoming into the eyes is united at the first impact with the surrounding air and alters the air to its own peculiar nature but does not itself extend out to the furthest distance.</p>\n\n<p>And the optic pneumacannot extend itself and acquire such a stream as to envelop the whole object viewed; for this is comparable to the Stoic drop that mixes with the whole sea.</p>\n\n<p>The Stoics, then, must not say that we see by means of the surrounding air as with a walking-stick. This latter kind of discernment is of resistant bodies, and it is besides more inferential than perceptive, whereas the perception of our eye is not perceptive of a thing as close packed, or of its hardness or softness, but of its colour, size, and position, and none of these can be discerned by a walking-stick.</p>\n\n<p>The organ of sight, for example, since it had to discriminate colours, was made luminous, for only such bodies are by nature capable of being altered by colours. The surrounding air shows this: when it is especially clear, then it is altered by colours. Thus when a person reclines under a tree in such air as that, you can see the colour of the tree enveloping him. And often when bright air touches thecolour of a wall, it receives the colour and transmits it to another body, especially when the wall is blue or yellow or some other bright hue. And just as at a mere touch all the air is assimilated all at once by the sunlight, in the same way it is immediately changed by colour. Here Aristotle was quite correct when he said about the sudden change of bodies thus altered, that it is very nearly instantaneous, and also, with regard to this alteration, that it is the nature of bright air, when altered by colours, to transmit the alteration all the way to the organ of sight. But Aristotle did not explain how we recognize the position or size or distance of each perceived object. &nbsp;Many of his followers, reasoning about his doctrine, are caught in error, since neither odours nor speech-sounds bring with them an indication of their place of origin, as I pointed out in the fifth book <em>On Demonstration</em>.</p>\n\n<p>Something similar happens also in the case of the air that surrounds us. When it has been illuminated by the sun, it is already an instrument of vision of the same description as the pneumacoming to it from the brain; but until it is illuminated it does not turn into a sympathetic instrument by virtue of the change effected in it by the outflow of the pneuma</p>\n\n<p>Galen did not provide an account for &quot;why the pneuma is necessary for perception, why not just the effect of sunlight is enough&quot;</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://arxiv.org/ftp/arxiv/papers/1902/1902.03627.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">Two Contrasting Concepts of Optics</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://farside.ph.utexas.edu/Books/Euclid/Elements.pdf\">Euclids Elements</a></p>\n\n<p><em>[Can we conclude that &quot;those who took God, heavenly objects, soul as central points were guided towards emission theory, and those who focussed more on the physical objects drove towards intromission theory&quot;?]</em></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Books:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://muse.jhu.edu/book/26422\">https://muse.jhu.edu/book/26422</a></p>\n\n<p id=\"bookTitle\" itemprop=\"name\"><a href=\"https://www.google.com/search?q=The+Logic+of+Scientific+Discovery&amp;oq=The+Logic+of+Scientific+Discovery+pdf\" target=\"_blank\">The Logic of Scientific Discovery</a></p>\n\n<p id=\"bookSeries\"><a href=\"http://www.pitt.edu/~jdnorton/teaching/HPS_0410/index.html\" target=\"_blank\">Einstein For Everybody - Philosophy of Relativity Theory</a></p>\n\n<p>https://einsteinpapers.press.princeton.edu/vol2-trans/154</p>\n\n<p>https://einsteinpapers.press.princeton.edu/vol7-trans/277</p>\n\n<p>Einstein <a href=\"https://relativityoflight.com/preamble\" target=\"_blank\">was maybe mistaken</a>, <a href=\"https://www.isroset.org/pdf_paper_view.php?paper_id=1707&amp;5-ISROSET-IJSRPAS-02949.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">[2]</a>, <a href=\"https://vinaire.me/2018/01/06/einsteins-1905-paper-on-relativity/\" target=\"_blank\">[3]</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://specialrelativitycritique.net/2019/01/25/questions-on-einsteins-1905-paper/\" target=\"_blank\">[4]</a> but he still made a paradigm shift in Physics. <a href=\"http://blog.hasslberger.com/docs/ERRORS_OF_SPECIAL_RELATIVITY.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">Misinterpretations of Einstein&#39;s paper</a>.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n", "authorId": 1, "subject": "philosophy", "tags": [""], "img": "", "summary": "", "lastUpdated": "2021-04-30 08:22:06.437248"}
