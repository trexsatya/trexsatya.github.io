{"name":"Keep CALMS and Devops","id":24,"content":"<p>DevOps although in short is said to be unification of <strong>Dev</strong> and <strong>Operations</strong> teams, it comprises of a lot of things. And the scope of DevOps is different for different organizations depending on where they stand. The basic idea of DecOps is to remove all the frictions that happen between start of the project and delivery of the product to market. Some of the frictions are well identified and hence are primary focus in DevOps e.g. Manual tasks which can be automated. Communication between Devs and Operations team members.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>To summarise the idea of Devops we have CALMS framework comprised of four elements: Culture, Automation, Lean and Sharing.</p>\n\n<h2><span style=\"color:#8e44ad;\">Culture</span></h2>\n\n<p>Shift from a fear of failure, to a <strong>fail-fast</strong>, <strong>fail-forward</strong> approach</p>\n\n<p>Shift from a tech obsession, to a <strong>customer obsession</strong>.</p>\n\n<p>Shift from organizational silos to a <strong>collaborative</strong> model.</p>\n\n<p>Shift from big data confusion to real-time <strong>information driven insight</strong>.</p>\n\n<p>So for example, if an application server is being maxed out, we make it easy to automatically&nbsp;spin up another server before a performance or outage issue.</p>\n\n<p>Capture application analytics, and present it in a manner that technical and non-technical people can make something out of this, get some insight into business strategies.</p>\n\n<h2><span style=\"color:#8e44ad;\">Automation</span></h2>\n\n<p>Speed can be dangerous. (More speed might mean more application outages.) You need to have solid <strong>proactive monitoring</strong>.</p>\n\n<p>Automation success isn&rsquo;t about the <strong>tools</strong> but the <strong>people</strong> and <strong>process</strong>.</p>\n\n<p>Automation is more than just infrastructure and application automation (infrastructure as code, application release and configuration release automation solutions). Automated issue response or <strong>remediation</strong> is essential.</p>\n\n<h2><span style=\"color:#8e44ad;\">Lean</span></h2>\n\n<p>Comes from Lean manufacturing concept, basically remove the waste from IT processes.</p>\n\n<p>3 types of wastes: (1) Physical (e.g. money, time, resources) (2). Inconsitency or unevenness of processes (3) Avoiding absurdity and unreasonableness.</p>\n\n<p>Lean Principles:&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">&ldquo;<strong>Poka-yoke</strong>&rdquo; -&gt; fail-safing, mistake-proofing</p>\n\n<p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">&quot;<strong>Kanban</strong>&quot;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;-&gt; Visual signal, about what what needs to be done and when</p>\n\n<p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">&quot;<strong>Kaizan</strong>&quot;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; -&gt;&nbsp;continuous improvement of your people, process and technology</p>\n\n<p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h2><span style=\"color:#8e44ad;\">Measurement</span></h2>\n\n<p>People Measurements:&nbsp;Key employee <strong>retention</strong>,&nbsp;Customer <strong>satisfaction</strong>/experience</p>\n\n<p>Process measurements:&nbsp;Release/change frequency,&nbsp;Volume of failures,&nbsp;Time/cost per <strong>release</strong>.</p>\n\n<p>Technology measurements:&nbsp;Mean Time To Resolution (<strong>MTTR</strong>),&nbsp;Mean Time Between Failure (<strong>MTBF</strong>),&nbsp;Mean Time To Customer Impact</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h2><span style=\"color:#8e44ad;\">Sharing</span></h2>\n\n<p>It is essential that every participant in the planning, designing, building, deploying and supporting of apps is able to share information about their area/responsibilities/tasks and to be able to communicate, without friction, with each other.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Feedback</strong> and <strong>Feed-forward</strong> methods.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h2>Tools for DevOps</h2>\n\n<p>DevOps is not all-about-tools, but yeah tools are primary player which accelerate the implementation of DevOps.
