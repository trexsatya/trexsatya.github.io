You need a source code repository: Options are Bitbucket, Github, etc.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;You need to decide whether you want to create one repository per service, or put related services in one repository.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Manage ACL. Who should have which kind of permission on the repositories?</p>\n\n<p>2. You will need a Build &amp; Project Management System. Maven is fine, but Gradle is advanced.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; Next, you&#39;ll need to define a project structure:&nbsp;</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>Which JDK to use?</li>\n\t<li>How to organise the code? How many subprojects, and based on what? (E.g. &#39;shared&#39;, &#39;api&#39;, &#39;service&#39;) <a href=\"/article/150\" target=\"_blank\">Setup multi-module project in Gradle</a>.</li>\n\t<li>Apply proper settings for each subproject. Keep in mind the maintanability factor. Create utility tasks if it seems ok.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>3. Use tools: Configure the tools</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>Sonarqube: for code quality</li>\n\t<li>Checkstyle</li>\n\t<li>Jacoco</li>\n</ul>\n", "authorId": 1, "subject": "programming", "tags": [], "img": "", "summary": "string", "lastUpdated": "2021-06-06 19:04:43.245803"}
