My people will use an app <em>(client)</em>&nbsp;which will directly or indirectly request your DBMS?&quot;</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>What are they going to use it for?</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>&quot;Umm.. they might request your DBMS to store some data like their name, email, phone etc..., and later on they might want to retrieve that data, maybe in huge amount like an admin could request data for all the employees....&quot;</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<hr />\n<p>We have a problem, it is pretty much well-defined: We want to store data, and we want to give data back.

But, we have two different kinds of memories in computers <em>(we know it from our domain knowledge, we know that they are drastically different from our experience, as well as analysis-based knowledge)</em>,&nbsp;</p>\n", "authorId": 1, "subject": "architecture", "tags": [], "img": "", "summary": "string", "lastUpdated": "2021-01-31 07:54:05.959613"}
