{"name":"Everything Summed Up","id":73,"content":"<p>If you want to know everything, you would have to start with two family of questions. And believe me when you are done you will notice that you know nothing and everything at the same time. &quot;How absurd that is&quot;, isn&#39;t this what you are thinking? Maybe it is. And why not.</p>\n\n<p>The two families of questions are:</p>\n\n<ol>\n\t<li>How did we get here?&nbsp;How did &quot;I&quot; get here? Where are we going?</li>\n\t<li>Now that we are here, what is the best way to be here? How do &quot;I&quot; get the best out of it? Are we in that direction?</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>&nbsp;These two sets of questions are not completely separate. They are interlinked on many levels. One clear way to see that is this: If you have a theory (idea, thought) about one of them, it affects the answer to the other automatically. Let&#39;s see how is that.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Let&#39;s ask ourselves, &quot;How did I get&nbsp;here?&quot;&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&lt;&lt;insert joke: how was I born?&gt;&gt;</p>\n\n<p>So, it is well known that we are born by the act of <em>reproduction</em>. Does it require sex? Yes&nbsp;and No. What do you mean by &quot;No&quot;?&nbsp;Can anyone give birth to a child without sex? - Yes, some organisms can give birth to a child without sex. But, can a human do it? - We haven&#39;t seen anyone do it.</p>\n\n<p>Then, why are there stories which tell us that some great person was born without sex? - Well, they are just stories. Stories can be made in a way whatever comes to mind which need not necessarily be true in the world that we see.</p>\n\n<p>But should we reject any story as false without investigating? If we do that then it is just a belief (no matter true of false). - But I just know that it can&#39;t be true, I can just feel it.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>But that&#39;s not a good reason. People could just feel or claim they knew a lot of things that turned out to be false. Example, the belief that the sun revolves around the earth. <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flat_Earth\" target=\"_blank\">The&nbsp;belief&nbsp;that the earth is&nbsp;flat</a>. Anyway we will come back to this question &quot;How do stories come to people&#39;s mind, stories that seem <em>unbelievable</em>?&quot;</p>\n\n<p>So we were looking at the question &quot;How did we get here?&quot; and the answer is &quot;by reproduction&quot;. Isn&#39;t it always obvious?! But, by reproduction, your parents brought you into the world, your grandparents brought your parents into the world, and so on. But how did the first man come into this world?&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>We said earlier that having a theory about this sort of question helps you other questions. But, let&#39;s stop for a second and ask &quot;How did these questions come to our mind?&quot;</p>\n\n<p>Probably this question and the question that &quot;How did the (unbelievable) stories come to our mind?&quot; have the same answer. We will get back to these questions later.</p>\n\n<p>Let&#39;s stay at the question &quot;How did the first man (woman) come into this world?&quot; and why just man or woman. &quot;How did any life come into this world?&quot;</p>\n\n<p>&lt;&lt;insert history and science&gt;&gt;</p>\n\n<p>Let&#39;s talk about the thoughts. People could not just live, they could not keep themselves from thinking. How did it come to happen?</p>\n\n<p>Is it the inherent property of the biological system that had been evolved that made it not only possible but necessary to create thoughts?&nbsp; - If yes, then if we somehow become successful in arranging everything in a similar structure that evolution has created, will the thought emerge automatically? Or, is time necessary for the thoughts to emerge meaning that it&#39;s not just the arrangement that made it possible, but the journey, the evolution of this arrangement that made it possible? If that is the case, then even if the time is necessary is it sufficient condition?</p>\n\n<p>Once the thoughts arose, the sounds coming out of the mouth eventually turned into spoken language.</p>\n\n<p>&lt;&lt;the journey: information as&nbsp;thoughts in mind -&gt; information as&nbsp;sound in language in air -&gt; information as symbols on punched-cards/paper&nbsp;-&gt; information as code on electric current -&gt;&nbsp; information as code on magnetic disks/ &gt;&gt;</p>\n\n<p>&lt;&lt;logic as code &gt;&gt;</p>\n\n<p>&lt;&lt;the first written information in form of symbols that represented thoughts is known from Mesopotamia &gt;&gt;</p>\n\n<p>&lt;&lt;jacquard&#39;s loom&gt;&gt;</p>\n\n<p>Turing&#39;s work, <a href=\"http://www.math.harvard.edu/~ctm/home/text/others/shannon/entropy/entropy.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">Shannon&#39;s work</a>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Information can cause order from disorder.
