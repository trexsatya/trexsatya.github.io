So I do it occasionally for some words.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>The world now is loaded with information, theories and what not. And this abundance seems to &mdash; misdirect &mdash; the (my) world in a sense.<br />\nSo, instead of focussing on all the theories in all the subject matters, let&#39;s think from first principles.</p>\n\n<p>So, the first principle is that &quot;I&quot; exist.<br />\nAnd, things exist. Things exist independent of &quot;me&quot; or not, does not really matter, because &quot;I&quot; come to know about existence of &quot;things&quot; only because (and only &quot;after&quot;) &quot;I exist&quot;. Trying to assert that things exist independent of me is nonsensical and contradictory to the logical structure[*1] which makes me think about all this in the first place.</p>\n\n<p>What things exist?<br />\nIt&#39;s a property of me that makes me identify &quot;parts&quot; of the &quot;whole&quot; as one thing or the other.<br />\nOne core property of me (&quot;me&quot; representing any &quot;living being&quot; here) is that it identifies itself as a thing. This thing is referred to as &quot;body&quot;.&nbsp;<br />\nWe can assert this because all living beings &mdash; on a fundamental level &mdash; are concerned about their body. They try to protect this body.&nbsp;<br />\nWhat is &quot;body&quot;?<br />\nBody is the first &quot;object&quot; that I recognise/perceive after coming into existence. We can assert this because we observe &quot;birth&quot; of a living creature and it already tries to protect it&#39;s body. There already is distinction b/w itself and the rest of everything.<br />\nAt the time of birth I (a living creature) is already aware of many things:<br />\n&nbsp; &nbsp; - Myself and rest of everything. Which implies I am aware of &quot;space&quot;.<br />\n&nbsp; &nbsp; - Time. Because I know that if I do something, like make some movement, I&#39;ll be able to protect myself. The knowledge of movement implies I have knowledge of &quot;time&quot;.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; The other way to look at this is that, it&#39;s not actually aware of anything, it&#39;s not trying to &quot;protect&quot; itself or anything like that. It&#39;s just a movement of a collection of things(particles). But that applies when we look at other things (living creatures). I already exist, I already am aware of things like Space and Time. I already am aware of &quot;self&quot; and the rest of everything (non-self).&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>With the knowledge and awareness of things like Space and Time, I interact with other &quot;things&quot; in the &quot;world&quot;. But how do I get sense of other things. With my birth a process has already started, &quot;the process of identification&quot;. First I identify my body from the rest. Then identify something else in the rest. The process continues.</p>\n\n<p>I am already equipped with the capacity of distinction. Distinction b/w what?&nbsp;<br />\n&nbsp;- Distinction between things. But things do not exist for me without the distinction b/w things. But the distinction b/w things cannot exist without my awareness of things. But maybe the &quot;capacity&quot; of distinction can exist without the actual distinction of things?<br />\nThe mechanics of this process of identification is something like this. How distinction of things is necessary for things to exist:-<br />\nImagine looking at a white canvas, or a white wall with nothing on it. Imagine that there&#39;s nothing else, just this wall, white wall. Just this one thing. Forget that you have a concept of a thing, just this wall is there. Can there be any other thing possible? For anything else to be on this white wall, there has to be something &quot;non-white&quot; (Otherwise it just cannot be). We already have a distinction here b/w white and non-white. Now, with this distinction in place, a different colour would make some figure, some shape (could be as simple as a line or a dot). Now we have come up with a thing on the wall (distinguishable from the wall itself). Now we can say &quot;there is a figure on the wall&quot;. That figure is now a thing. It&#39;s not the wall itself, but instead it&#39;s a thing on the wall. However, this thing cannot exist - without the wall - and without the distinction b/w the wall and that thing.&nbsp;<br />\nSo, here are the pre-requisites for this thing to exist:-<br />\n1. The wall (or the perception of the wall - in form of imagination here).<br />\n2. The knowledge of colors - white and non-white.<br />\n3. The capacity of distinction.<br />\n4. The &quot;me&quot; who is able to perceive the wall, the colors, and has the capacity to distinguish.</p>\n\n<p>Also, in order for this thing to exist, this whole process was a pre-requisite. &quot;Me&quot; willing to perceive the wall, deciding to perceive the wall, actually perceiving the wall, applying the knowledge of colors, exercising the capacity of distinction, perceiving the figure (the thing) as separate from the wall.<br />\nThis whole process is identified as distinct from some other happening. That&#39;s also a pre-requisite for this process.</p>\n\n<p>Now, consider this: the wall is also a &quot;thing&quot;. What are pre-requisites for this wall to exist?</p>\n\n<p>With this we just did a thought experiment on &quot;Space, Time and Creation&quot;. &quot;And I was already there in order for this to happen&quot;.<br />\nIn order for me to be able to distinguish one thing from the other, or distinguish myself from the rest of everything (non-self), I need the capacity of distinction. But a capacity of distinction can exist only after an actual happening of distinction. But, &quot;experience&quot; tells us that a capacity of something can exist only after an actual happening of that thing (that is, capacity of distinction cannot exist without me, at some point, doing the actual act of distinction). But for being able to do the actual distinction of things, and for things to exist, I need to have all those &quot;pre-requisites&quot;.</p>\n\n<p>If the capacity of distinction can exist without the actual manifestation of distinction, the &quot;capacity&quot; of being something can also exist without the actual manifestation of that thing.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;There&#39;s potential of something and then there&#39;s manifestation of that potential&quot;.<br />\n&quot;The manifestation requires potential, but the experience tells us that potential requires manifestation&quot;.<br />\n&quot;The manifestation of one thing requires manifestation of other thing(s)&quot;.<br />\n&quot;The potential of one thing requires potential of other thing(s)&quot;.<br />\n&quot;Being and non-being (of anything) co-exist. The experience separates them into two.&quot;<br />\n&quot;The knowledge of things requires experience of things.&quot;<br />\n&quot;The experience requires experiencer, but the experiencer requires a lot of things, many of those things are - prior experiences, prior knowledge etc&quot;<br />\n&quot;Things are inter-dependent, processes are inter-dependent, manifestations are inter-dependent, existence is inter-dependent, knowledges are inter-dependent&quot;</p>\n\n<p>None of it makes sense...</p>\n\n<p>*1 The logical structure which makes this whole process of analysis possible demands the concept of &quot;prior&quot;, &quot;cause&quot;, &quot;effect&quot;, &quot;necessity&quot;, &quot;impossibility&quot;... Some things/events have to exist in prior for the other things to exist.<br />\n*2 entities here are already a result of perceiving things. Observe how different animals act upon same things in a different way.</p>\n\n<p>--------------------------------------</p>\n\n<p>Why don&#39;t we see the wall and the thing on the wall as one?</p>\n\n<p>With the same process that we followed above for seeing a figure on the wall (as a thing on the wall, separate from the wall), we see other things on the wall, separate from the wall and separate from other things. How do we see one figure on the wall separate from the other figure on the wall.<br />\nWe will say it&#39;s one figure if it is &quot;connected&quot; in some way. So, for example, we&#39;ll say this is a figure X and this is a figure Y. They are 2 different figures because they are situated at different &quot;locations&quot; on the wall. If I draw a line b/w these 2 figures, I&#39;ll say that they are 2 figures connected by a line, so it&#39;s a composite of 3 figures (2 figures and a line). What if 2 of those figures were lines.. So, one line is a composite of many lines? a composite of many dots?</p>\n\n<p>They are 2 different figures connected by a line because I have seen the construction of this.</p>\n\n<p>But if I had not perceived this process of connecting 2 figures with a line (another figure), I would have perceived this as one figure only in the first place.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>So, if I had never seen the construction, I&#39;d never have perceived them as separate?</p>\n\n<p>Yes, but the perception here doesn&#39;t have to correspond to the actual experience, it could be perception by imagination...</p>\n\n<p>But, for the imagination of this construction of composite figure from 3 separate figures requires that I have the perception of them as separate figures.</p>\n\n<p><br />\nWhat if I replaced the connecting line with a connecting line of dots? Would I still have thought of it as one figure in the first place?</p>\n\n<p>What if the line (connecting line) was too long? Would I still have seen it as one figure only, or would I have seen it as 2 figures connected by a long line?</p>\n\n<p>&quot;We see things separate because of our perception. The perception of &#39;separate&#39; requires experience of separate things, the experience again requires the capacity of separation, and the capacity requires perception/experience of separation&quot;</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Oneness and separateness co-exist, our experience, perception makes them see otherwise.&quot;<br />\n&quot;The limitation in our perception separates things from one another.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>--------------------------------------</p>\n\n<p>In this simple world consisting me, white wall, and a thing on the wall, what came to existence first?<br />\nOf course in this thought experiment, &quot;I&quot; was already there, then the thing was perceived into existence.<br />\nBut perception of the thing is possible only if the thing already existed.</p>\n\n<p>Let&#39;s create a world right from the beginning.</p>\n\n<p>Mark the word: &quot;beginning&quot;</p>\n\n<p>We&#39;ll start from the simplest form of life.<br />\nWhat will this simplest form of life do?</p>\n\n<p>Well.. once it gets its birth it will start having problems, and it will start trying to find the solution to those problems. That&#39;s one perspective.<br />\nAlso, once it gets its birth it will have a clear separation between its *self* and everything else. It will have a *desire* to keep its self in a balanced state. When it finds that the state has been compromised, it will do everything to bring its self back to this state.<br />\nThat is how it feels hunger, for example. The states of its self depends upon the state of its physical body.<br />\nThe body runs in a mechanical fashion and there are physical laws which govern this mechanism. So, it&#39;s certain that the physical state will change.<br />\n(For context, if I somehow set something in motion, it&#39;s in a certain state - i.e. the state of motion - but due to physical laws in action, it will not always remain in this state)</p>\n\n<p>This organism will have certain mechanism by which it will be affected by the environment. Some parts of the body will be more active than others through which it will be affected by its evironment (again this has to supported by a physical form - the body). [Think about the senses]</p>\n\n<p>The body is a composite of other bodies working together. Each set of bodies has this property to maintain some state - to some degree!</p>\n\n<p>This organism will not only be aware about the difference between its self and everything else, it will also be aware about the different &quot;parts&quot; of the body, those parts which can be considered &quot;senses&quot; and the other ones.</p>\n\n<p>This simplest form of life will have another property, not only it tries to maintain its state, it also tries to explore the environment, interact with the environment in many ways. [Seems like it is at unrest when it gets to its natural state]<br />\nIt has mechanism to record some of the explorations and forms memories and habits. (That&#39;s how it it&#39;s able to bring itself back to its natural state again and again in different environments. For example, that&#39;s how it *learns* how to get food to satisfy its hunger in different environments, that&#39;s how it remembers what it can eat, and what it cannot eat). Of course, this memory and habit has to be associated with the physical body in some way to be able to *persist through time*.</p>\n\n<p>This organism will also have memory of its body parts (including senses) and habits which will allow it to make use of senses during exploration of the world.</p>\n\n<p>This simplest form of life will have another property, it can recognise other forms of life similar to it (and hence forming a category).<br />\nIts interaction with other forms of life will be affected by the category they fall in (from this organisms *perspective*). (For example, it won&#39;t consider the organisms of its own category as food)</p>\n\n<p>Then it will have another property, somehow it will try to see its self in another body. (That&#39;s why it tries to replicate)</p>\n\n<p>So, far the basically the summary is: there&#39;s a self with a body or a body with a self which tries to persist through space and time.<br />\nRemember, all this from a perspective - our perspective - there could just be a body as well going through changes giving impression of all these functionalities, no self at all.</p>\n\n<p>We can summarise and say that this simple organism already has these concepts:<br />\n1. Concept of self and not-self<br />\n2. Concept of space and time<br />\n3. Concept of objects, boundaries<br />\n4. Concept of type/category<br />\n5. Model of the world, memory, tendencies and habits</p>\n\n<p>We are saying that it &quot;wants&quot;, &quot;tries to&quot;.. these seem like human thing...<br />\nLet&#39;s see if we can clarify these words.</p>\n\n<p>The word &quot;wants&quot;, &quot;tries to&quot; is justified if I put many such organisms but only some of them exibit a specified behavior. [Let&#39;s keep it simple for now, we&#39;ll come back to it later]<br />\nSo, the organism &quot;tries to&quot; fit into the environment, not every organism of this type will do..<br />\nThe organism wants to have sex, not every one will do (to the same extent)</p>\n\n<p><br />\n-------------------------------------</p>\n\n<p>Free-Will:<br />\nIn my dream I have seen it happen more than once that the physical event caused a backstory to be formed even if there really was no basis.<br />\nWhen my finger was pressed hard to the point that it hurt (which I found after coming out of dream), in my dream I saw that this pain resulted from a bolster on my finger, but then I thought that how did the bolster get suddenly on my finger, then I thought &quot;Ohh, it was there but very small, it was developing, and now it has started hurting&quot;..<br />\nMy brain was justifying the pain by forming a story around it.</p>\n\n<p>This suggests that my brain will form a story around the events about which it is not aware fully. It&#39;s not a big jump to say that it will also form a story if the body decided to take some action based on stimuli.<br />\nBut this does not mean that my conscious will cannot affect my body.</p>\n\n<p>----------------------------------------</p>\n\n<p>If you want to know everything, you would have to start with two family of questions. And believe me when you are done you will notice that you know nothing and everything at the same time. &quot;How absurd that is&quot;, isn&#39;t this what you are thinking? Maybe it is. And why not.</p>\n\n<p>The two families of questions are:</p>\n\n<ol>\n\t<li>How did we get here?&nbsp;How did &quot;I&quot; get here? Where are we going?</li>\n\t<li>Now that we are here, what is the best way to be here? How do &quot;I&quot; get the best out of it? What is &quot;best&quot;? (Why do we have to get the &quot;best&quot;?) Are we in that direction?</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>&nbsp;These two sets of questions are not completely separate. They are interlinked on many levels. One clear way to see that is this: If you have a theory (idea, thought) about one of them, it affects the answer to the other automatically. Let&#39;s see how is that.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Let&#39;s ask ourselves, &quot;How did I get&nbsp;here?&quot;</p>\n\n<p>So, it is well known that we are born by the act of <em>reproduction</em>. Does it require sex? Yes&nbsp;and No. What do you mean by &quot;No&quot;?&nbsp;Can anyone give birth to a child without sex? - Yes, some organisms can give birth to a child without sex. But, can a human do it? - We haven&#39;t seen anyone do it.</p>\n\n<p>Then, why are there stories which tell us that some great person was born without sex? - Well, they are just stories. Stories can be made in a way whatever comes to mind which need not necessarily be true in the world that we see.</p>\n\n<p>But should we reject any story as false without investigating? If we do that then it is just a belief (no matter true of false). - But I just know that it can&#39;t be true, I can just feel it.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>But that&#39;s not a good reason. People could just feel or claim they knew a lot of things that turned out to be false. Example, the belief that the sun revolves around the earth. <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flat_Earth\" target=\"_blank\">The&nbsp;belief&nbsp;that the earth is&nbsp;flat</a>. Anyway we will come back to this question &quot;How do stories come to people&#39;s mind, stories that seem <em>unbelievable</em>?&quot;</p>\n\n<p>So we were looking at the question &quot;How did we get here?&quot; and the answer is &quot;by reproduction&quot;. Isn&#39;t it always obvious?! But, by reproduction, your parents brought you into the world, your grandparents brought your parents into the world, and so on. But how did the first man come into this world?&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>We said earlier that having a theory about this sort of question helps you other questions. But, let&#39;s stop for a second and ask &quot;How did these questions come to our mind?&quot;</p>\n\n<p>Probably this question and the question that &quot;How did the (unbelievable) stories come to our mind?&quot; have the same answer. We will get back to these questions later.</p>\n\n<p>Let&#39;s stay at the question &quot;How did the first man (woman) come into this world?&quot; and why just man or woman. &quot;How did any life come into this world?&quot;</p>\n\n<p>&lt;&lt;insert history and science&gt;&gt;</p>\n\n<p>Let&#39;s talk about the thoughts. People could not just live, they could not keep themselves from thinking. How did it come to happen?</p>\n\n<p>Is it the inherent property of the biological system that had been evolved that made it not only possible but necessary to create thoughts?&nbsp; - If yes, then if we somehow become successful in arranging everything in a similar structure that evolution has created, will the thought emerge automatically? Or, is time necessary for the thoughts to emerge meaning that it&#39;s not just the arrangement that made it possible, but the journey, the evolution of this arrangement that made it possible? If that is the case, then even if the time is necessary is it sufficient condition?</p>\n\n<p>Once the thoughts arose, the sounds coming out of the mouth eventually turned into spoken language.</p>\n\n<p>&lt;&lt;the journey: information as&nbsp;thoughts in mind -&gt; information as&nbsp;sound in language in air -&gt; information as symbols on punched-cards/paper&nbsp;-&gt; information as code on electric current -&gt;&nbsp; information as code on magnetic disks/ &gt;&gt;</p>\n\n<p>&lt;&lt;logic as code &gt;&gt;</p>\n\n<p>&lt;&lt;the first written information in form of symbols that represented thoughts is known from Mesopotamia &gt;&gt;</p>\n\n<p>&lt;&lt;jacquard&#39;s loom&gt;&gt;</p>\n\n<p>Turing&#39;s work, <a href=\"http://www.math.harvard.edu/~ctm/home/text/others/shannon/entropy/entropy.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">Shannon&#39;s work</a>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Information can cause order from disorder.

If we do that then it is just a belief (no matter true of false). - But I just know that it can&#39;t be true, I can just feel it.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>But that&#39;s not a good reason. People could just feel or claim they knew a lot of things that turned out to be false. Example, the belief that the sun revolves around the earth. <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flat_Earth\" target=\"_blank\">The&nbsp;belief&nbsp;that the earth is&nbsp;flat</a>. Anyway we will come back to this question &quot;How do stories come to people&#39;s mind, stories that seem <em>unbelievable</em>?&quot;</p>\n\n<p>So we were looking at the question &quot;How did we get here?&quot; and the answer is &quot;by reproduction&quot;. Isn&#39;t it always obvious?! But, by reproduction, your parents brought you into the world, your grandparents brought your parents into the world, and so on. But how did the first man come into this world?&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>We said earlier that having a theory about this sort of question helps you other questions. But, let&#39;s stop for a second and ask &quot;How did these questions come to our mind?&quot;</p>\n\n<p>Probably this question and the question that &quot;How did the (unbelievable) stories come to our mind?&quot; have the same answer. We will get back to these questions later.</p>\n\n<p>Let&#39;s stay at the question &quot;How did the first man (woman) come into this world?&quot; and why just man or woman. &quot;How did any life come into this world?&quot;</p>\n\n<p>&lt;&lt;insert history and science&gt;&gt;</p>\n\n<p>Let&#39;s talk about the thoughts. People could not just live, they could not keep themselves from thinking. How did it come to happen?</p>\n\n<p>Is it the inherent property of the biological system that had been evolved that made it not only possible but necessary to create thoughts?&nbsp; - If yes, then if we somehow become successful in arranging everything in a similar structure that evolution has created, will the thought emerge automatically? Or, is time necessary for the thoughts to emerge meaning that it&#39;s not just the arrangement that made it possible, but the journey, the evolution of this arrangement that made it possible? If that is the case, then even if the time is necessary is it sufficient condition?</p>\n\n<p>Once the thoughts arose, the sounds coming out of the mouth eventually turned into spoken language.</p>\n\n<p>&lt;&lt;the journey: information as&nbsp;thoughts in mind -&gt; information as&nbsp;sound in language in air -&gt; information as symbols on punched-cards/paper&nbsp;-&gt; information as code on electric current -&gt;&nbsp; information as code on magnetic disks/ &gt;&gt;</p>\n\n<p>&lt;&lt;logic as code &gt;&gt;</p>\n\n<p>&lt;&lt;the first written information in form of symbols that represented thoughts is known from Mesopotamia &gt;&gt;</p>\n\n<p>&lt;&lt;jacquard&#39;s loom&gt;&gt;</p>\n\n<p>Turing&#39;s work, <a href=\"http://www.math.harvard.edu/~ctm/home/text/others/shannon/entropy/entropy.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">Shannon&#39;s work</a>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Information can cause order from disorder. Can information be without physical structure? Can information be without smething that understands information?&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Information &lt;---&gt; Order from Disorder</p>\n\n<p>Entropy&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &lt;---&gt; Disorder from Order</p>\n\n<p>Birth&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &lt;---&gt; Order from Disorder</p>\n\n<p>Death&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&lt;----&gt; Disorder from Order</p>\n\n<p>Morphogenesis, Self-Organization, Chaos &amp; Feedback Loops</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>The Simulated World:<br />\n-------------------</p>\n\n<p>Let&#39;s create a world right from the beginning.</p>\n\n<p>Mark the word: &quot;beginning&quot;</p>\n\n<p>We&#39;ll start from the simplest form of life.<br />\nWhat will this simplest form of life do?</p>\n\n<p>Well.. once it gets its birth it will start having problems, and it will start trying to find the solution to those problems. That&#39;s one perspective.<br />\nAlso, once it gets its birth it will have a clear separation between its *self* and everything else. It will have a *desire* to keep its self in a balanced state. When it finds that the state has been compromised, it will do everything to bring its self back to this state.<br />\nThat is how it feels hunger, for example. The states of its self depends upon the state of its physical body.<br />\nThe body runs in a mechanical fashion and there are physical laws which govern this mechanism. So, it&#39;s certain that the physical state will change.<br />\n(For context, if I somehow set something in motion, it&#39;s in a certain state - i.e. the state of motion - but due to physical laws in action, it will not always remain in this state)</p>\n\n<p>This organism will have certain mechanism by which it will be affected by the environment. Some parts of the body will be more active than others through which it will be affected by its evironment (again this has to supported by a physical form - the body). [Think about the senses]</p>\n\n<p>The body is a composite of other bodies working together. Each set of bodies has this property to maintain some state - to some degree!</p>\n\n<p>This organism will not only be aware about the difference between its self and everything else, it will also be aware about the different &quot;parts&quot; of the body, those parts which can be considered &quot;senses&quot; and the other ones.</p>\n\n<p>This simplest form of life will have another property, not only it tries to maintain its state, it also tries to explore the environment, interact with the environment in many ways. [Seems like it is at unrest when it gets to its natural state]<br />\nIt has mechanism to record some of the explorations and forms memories and habits. (That&#39;s how it it&#39;s able to bring itself back to its natural state again and again in different environments. For example, that&#39;s how it *learns* how to get food to satisfy its hunger in different environments, that&#39;s how it remembers what it can eat, and what it cannot eat). Of course, this memory and habit has to be associated with the physical body in some way to be able to *persist through time*.</p>\n\n<p>This organism will also have memory of its body parts (including senses) and habits which will allow it to make use of senses during exploration of the world.</p>\n\n<p>This simplest form of life will have another property, it can recognise other forms of life similar to it (and hence forming a category).<br />\nIts interaction with other forms of life will be affected by the category they fall in (from this organisms *perspective*). (For example, it won&#39;t consider the organisms of its own category as food)</p>\n\n<p>Then it will have another property, somehow it will try to see its self in another body. (That&#39;s why it tries to replicate)</p>\n\n<p>So, far the basically the summary is: there&#39;s a self with a body or a body with a self which tries to persist through space and time.<br />\nRemember, all this from a perspective - our perspective - there could just be a body as well going through changes giving impression of all these functionalities, no self at all.</p>\n\n<p>We can summarise and say that this simple organism already has these concepts:<br />\n1. Concept of self and not-self<br />\n2. Concept of space and time<br />\n3. Concept of objects, boundaries<br />\n4. Concept of type/category<br />\n5. Model of the world, memory, tendencies and habits</p>\n\n<p>We are saying that it &quot;wants&quot;, &quot;tries to&quot;.. these seem like human thing...<br />\nLet&#39;s see if we can clarify these words.</p>\n\n<p>The word &quot;wants&quot;, &quot;tries to&quot; is justified if I put many such organisms but only some of them exibit a specified behavior. [Let&#39;s keep it simple for now, we&#39;ll come back to it later]<br />\nSo, the organism &quot;tries to&quot; fit into the environment, not every organism of this type will do..<br />\nThe organism wants to have sex, not every one will do (to the same extent)</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n", "authorId": 1, "subject": "hidden", "tags": [], "img": "", "summary": "", "lastUpdated": "2022-12-07 12:38:45.989268"}
