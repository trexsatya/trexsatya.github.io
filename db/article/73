{"name": "Everything Summed Up", "id": 73, "content": "<p>If you want to know everything, you would have to start with two family of questions. And believe me when you are done you will notice that you know nothing and everything at the same time. &quot;How absurd that is&quot;, isn&#39;t this what you are thinking? Maybe it is. And why not.</p>\n\n<p>The two families of questions are:</p>\n\n<ol>\n\t<li>How did we get here?&nbsp;How did &quot;I&quot; get here? Where are we going?</li>\n\t<li>Now that we are here, what is the best way to be here? How do &quot;I&quot; get the best out of it? Are we in that direction?</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>&nbsp;These two sets of questions are not completely separate. They are interlinked on many levels. One clear way to see that is this: If you have a theory (idea, thought) about one of them, it affects the answer to the other automatically. Let&#39;s see how is that.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Let&#39;s ask ourselves, &quot;How did I get&nbsp;here?&quot;&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&lt;&lt;insert joke: how was I born?&gt;&gt;</p>\n\n<p>So, it is well known that we are born by the act of <em>reproduction</em>. Does it require sex? Yes&nbsp;and No. What do you mean by &quot;No&quot;?&nbsp;Can anyone give birth to a child without sex? - Yes, some organisms can give birth to a child without sex. But, can a human do it? - We haven&#39;t seen anyone do it.</p>\n\n<p>Then, why are there stories which tell us that some great person was born without sex? - Well, they are just stories. Stories can be made in a way whatever comes to mind which need not necessarily be true in the world that we see.</p>\n\n<p>But should we reject any story as false without investigating? If we do that then it is just a belief (no matter true of false). - But I just know that it can&#39;t be true, I can just feel it.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>But that&#39;s not a good reason. People could just feel or claim they knew a lot of things that turned out to be false. Example, the belief that the sun revolves around the earth. <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flat_Earth\" target=\"_blank\">The&nbsp;belief&nbsp;that the earth is&nbsp;flat</a>. Anyway we will come back to this question &quot;How do stories come to people&#39;s mind, stories that seem <em>unbelievable</em>?&quot;</p>\n\n<p>So we were looking at the question &quot;How did we get here?&quot; and the answer is &quot;by reproduction&quot;. Isn&#39;t it always obvious?! But, by reproduction, your parents brought you into the world, your grandparents brought your parents into the world, and so on. But how did the first man come into this world?&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>We said earlier that having a theory about this sort of question helps you other questions. But, let&#39;s stop for a second and ask &quot;How did these questions come to our mind?&quot;</p>\n\n<p>Probably this question and the question that &quot;How did the (unbelievable) stories come to our mind?&quot; have the same answer. We will get back to these questions later.</p>\n\n<p>Let&#39;s stay at the question &quot;How did the first man (woman) come into this world?&quot; and why just man or woman. &quot;How did any life come into this world?&quot;</p>\n\n<p>&lt;&lt;insert history and science&gt;&gt;</p>\n\n<p>Let&#39;s talk about the thoughts. People could not just live, they could not keep themselves from thinking. How did it come to happen?</p>\n\n<p>Is it the inherent property of the biological system that had been evolved that made it not only possible but necessary to create thoughts?&nbsp; - If yes, then if we somehow become successful in arranging everything in a similar structure that evolution has created, will the thought emerge automatically? Or, is time necessary for the thoughts to emerge meaning that it&#39;s not just the arrangement that made it possible, but the journey, the evolution of this arrangement that made it possible? If that is the case, then even if the time is necessary is it sufficient condition?</p>\n\n<p>Once the thoughts arose, the sounds coming out of the mouth eventually turned into spoken language.</p>\n\n<p>&lt;&lt;the journey: information as&nbsp;thoughts in mind -&gt; information as&nbsp;sound in language in air -&gt; information as symbols on punched-cards/paper&nbsp;-&gt; information as code on electric current -&gt;&nbsp; information as code on magnetic disks/ &gt;&gt;</p>\n\n<p>&lt;&lt;logic as code &gt;&gt;</p>\n\n<p>&lt;&lt;the first written information in form of symbols that represented thoughts is known from Mesopotamia &gt;&gt;</p>\n\n<p>&lt;&lt;jacquard&#39;s loom&gt;&gt;</p>\n\n<p>Turing&#39;s work, <a href=\"http://www.math.harvard.edu/~ctm/home/text/others/shannon/entropy/entropy.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">Shannon&#39;s work</a>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Information can cause order from disorder. Can information be without physical structure? Can information be without smething that understands information?&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Information &lt;---&gt; Order from Disorder</p>\n\n<p>Entropy&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &lt;---&gt; Disorder from Order</p>\n\n<p>Birth&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &lt;---&gt; Order from Disorder</p>\n\n<p>Death&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&lt;----&gt; Disorder from Order</p>\n\n<p>Morphogenesis, Self-Organization, Chaos &amp; Feedback Loops</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>The Simulated World:<br />\n-------------------</p>\n\n<p>Let&#39;s create a world right from the beginning.</p>\n\n<p>Mark the word: &quot;beginning&quot;</p>\n\n<p>We&#39;ll start from the simplest form of life.<br />\nWhat will this simplest form of life do?</p>\n\n<p>Well.. once it gets its birth it will start having problems, and it will start trying to find the solution to those problems. That&#39;s one perspective.<br />\nAlso, once it gets its birth it will have a clear separation between its *self* and everything else. It will have a *desire* to keep its self in a balanced state. When it finds that the state has been compromised, it will do everything to bring its self back to this state.<br />\nThat is how it feels hunger, for example. The states of its self depends upon the state of its physical body.<br />\nThe body runs in a mechanical fashion and there are physical laws which govern this mechanism. So, it&#39;s certain that the physical state will change.<br />\n(For context, if I somehow set something in motion, it&#39;s in a certain state - i.e. the state of motion - but due to physical laws in action, it will not always remain in this state)</p>\n\n<p>This organism will have certain mechanism by which it will be affected by the environment. Some parts of the body will be more active than others through which it will be affected by its evironment (again this has to supported by a physical form - the body). [Think about the senses]</p>\n\n<p>The body is a composite of other bodies working together. Each set of bodies has this property to maintain some state - to some degree!</p>\n\n<p>This organism will not only be aware about the difference between its self and everything else, it will also be aware about the different &quot;parts&quot; of the body, those parts which can be considered &quot;senses&quot; and the other ones.</p>\n\n<p>This simplest form of life will have another property, not only it tries to maintain its state, it also tries to explore the environment, interact with the environment in many ways. [Seems like it is at unrest when it gets to its natural state]<br />\nIt has mechanism to record some of the explorations and forms memories and habits. (That&#39;s how it it&#39;s able to bring itself back to its natural state again and again in different environments. For example, that&#39;s how it *learns* how to get food to satisfy its hunger in different environments, that&#39;s how it remembers what it can eat, and what it cannot eat). Of course, this memory and habit has to be associated with the physical body in some way to be able to *persist through time*.</p>\n\n<p>This organism will also have memory of its body parts (including senses) and habits which will allow it to make use of senses during exploration of the world.</p>\n\n<p>This simplest form of life will have another property, it can recognise other forms of life similar to it (and hence forming a category).<br />\nIts interaction with other forms of life will be affected by the category they fall in (from this organisms *perspective*). (For example, it won&#39;t consider the organisms of its own category as food)</p>\n\n<p>Then it will have another property, somehow it will try to see its self in another body. (That&#39;s why it tries to replicate)</p>\n\n<p>So, far the basically the summary is: there&#39;s a self with a body or a body with a self which tries to persist through space and time.<br />\nRemember, all this from a perspective - our perspective - there could just be a body as well going through changes giving impression of all these functionalities, no self at all.</p>\n\n<p>We can summarise and say that this simple organism already has these concepts:<br />\n1. Concept of self and not-self<br />\n2. Concept of space and time<br />\n3. Concept of objects, boundaries<br />\n4. Concept of type/category<br />\n5. Model of the world, memory, tendencies and habits</p>\n\n<p>We are saying that it &quot;wants&quot;, &quot;tries to&quot;.. these seem like human thing...<br />\nLet&#39;s see if we can clarify these words.</p>\n\n<p>The word &quot;wants&quot;, &quot;tries to&quot; is justified if I put many such organisms but only some of them exibit a specified behavior. [Let&#39;s keep it simple for now, we&#39;ll come back to it later]<br />\nSo, the organism &quot;tries to&quot; fit into the environment, not every organism of this type will do..<br />\nThe organism wants to have sex, not every one will do (to the same extent)</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n", "authorId": 1, "subject": "hidden", "tags": [], "img": "", "summary": "", "lastUpdated": "2021-12-21 12:33:53.275771"}
