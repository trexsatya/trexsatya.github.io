We can have an estimate of the situation on discrimination by looking at how many laws are there to prevent discriminations, what incidents took place, how many organizations are there working against discriminations etc.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h2>Male-Female Discriminations&nbsp;</h2>\n\n<p><strong>How were women treated?</strong></p>\n\n<p>From a global perspective, it can be said that women&nbsp;were not treated in a way they should have been. The main problems concerning male-female discrimination are:&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Lack of Freedom, Violence against them, Lack of involvement in social frameworks (e.g. Parliament, Government, Business etc), Lack of Education, Treatment as Property or Thing (including Trafficking, Prostitution, Slavery (intra-household) etc).</p>\n\n<p><strong>How are they treated now?</strong></p>\n\n<p>In a better way. There has been an improvement with regards to each of the problems listed above.
