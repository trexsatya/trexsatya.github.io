Does hate fade over time or grow?</p>\n\n<p>Are you moved/affected more by negative news or positive news?</p>\n</div>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Massed Repetition - something that is enforced in memory repetitively without many&nbsp;intervals in-between.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>Spaced Presentation</strong> - you are exposed to that thing maybe repetitively, but with intervals in between.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>You&nbsp;<em>say something to someone enough times</em>, and eventually, he internalizes&nbsp;<em>it - <a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3398228/\" target=\"_blank\">Bojack Horseman</a></em></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>In most of the cases, Spaced Presentation will result in better memory. <strong>Why?</strong>&nbsp;- There are three technical theories. But we can understand them in simple terms.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>What do you remember more? One with which you have a deep connection&nbsp;or one with which you have no connection? Just think about it, one special friend and another casual friend, how many things you remember about them? And how do you develop deep connections? Isn&#39;t it by sharing and linking different aspects of your life? - Yes, the same thing happens with Spaced Presentation, you attach different contextual information to the piece of information you are presented.</p>\n\n<p>It&#39;s also about involvement. With Spaced Presentation, you are more involved with the task. The intertwining of life and learning.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>So the next time you repeat the task after space (interval), your brain rewinds the previous time, analyzes it, gets benefit from it, it sort of acts as training. While in Mass Repetition, your brain takes it for granted. Don&#39;t believe it? Try focussing on something for some time, even if that something is moving and important. The important thing is your mind might take even space(intervals) for granted if this is highly patterned.</p>\n\n<p><strong>How Does It Matter?</strong></p>\n\n<p>Ad agencies use it to correctly space their advertisements so that it sticks to your mind.</p>\n\n<p>It also suggests that Cramming is an ineffective technique.</p>\n\n<p>It can be used to intelligently design textbooks, course structures, and exams so that things stick to students minds.</p>\n\n<p>All of this is studied under <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spacing_effect\" target=\"_blank\">Spacing&nbsp;Effect</a>.</p>\n\n<hr />\n<p>Is it possible that the words that you hear give you a false estimate or false memory? That you saw two vehicles colliding at a slower speed, but later when a friend tries to recall this accident using words like the vehicles <strong>smashed</strong> into each other. and you falsely recall that the vehicles were at very high speed?</p>\n\n<p>Probably not if the incident has had a deep impact on you&nbsp;but in casual scenarios?</p>\n\n<p>If I ask the question &quot;Did you see <strong>the</strong> stop sign there&quot;? rather than &quot;Did you see <strong>a</strong> stop sign there&quot;? And you vaguely remember the incident, to which one you are likely to answer <em>yes</em>? &quot;<strong>the</strong>&quot; is suggesting your mind that it&#39;s fact, and then your brain tries to recollect in the realm of this expectation.</p>\n\n<p>Can adjectives used by you or someone you listen to make you see false positives or miss the truth, factual piece of information? - Why not? We fall prey to exaggeration all the time.</p>\n\n<p>Can you make a person believe that he/she was sexually abused in childhood even though he wasn&#39;t? - It has been so. <em>Inception, Memory Implantation</em>?</p>\n\n<p>If your mind can be affected by a true piece of information, it can also be affected by a false piece of information, because your brain is not a super computer and it does not validate every incoming thing. Sometimes it presupposes some things (more readily if it is suggested implicitly).</p>\n\n<p>But who is more likely to fall prey to False Memory? - Those who are more imaginative, those who don&#39;t think slow, those who conform easily, those who are sleep deprived etc.</p>\n\n<p><strong>How does it matter?</strong></p>\n\n<p>It&#39;s used in medical therapies. It&#39;s been used to show that eye-witnesses are not a reliable source of proof in legal procedures.</p>\n\n<p>All of this is studied under <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/False_memory\" target=\"_blank\">False Memory Phenomenon</a></p>\n\n<hr />\n<p>Is it possible that what you claim to be your &quot;original&quot; idea had a different source? Or what you consider radically &quot;new&quot; has already happened in reality?</p>\n\n<p>Yes, it is, it has been. Many authors were even perplexed, embarrassed that this happened to them.</p>\n\n<p>This is studied under&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptomnesia\" target=\"_blank\">Cryptomnesia</a></p>\n\n<hr />\n<p>If you recall an event, would the emotional intensity associated with it drop or rise or stay the same?</p>\n\n<p>It depends on the emotion. If it was positive emotion, you are more likely to maintain the emotional intensity. In the case of negative emotion, it tends to drop over time. Or is it otherwise?</p>\n\n<p>First one suggests that &quot;love grows, hate fades over time&quot; (<em>but does it always, or even ever?</em>).&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>What factors are involved in retaining positive emotion associated with memory? - One is social sharing (this enforces positive, and suppresses negative emotions associated with memory). However, self-rehearsal is not as effective.</p>\n\n<p>Does it depend on the current emotional state of the person at the time of recall? - Little.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fading_affect_bias\" target=\"_blank\">Fading Affect Bias</a></p>\n\n<hr />\n<p>Which things have a more profound effect on people, positive or negative?</p>\n\n<p>Negative Bias says it&#39;s negative things (e.g. unpleasant thoughts, emotions, or social interactions; harmful/traumatic events). Maybe that&#39;s why you need to compliment people on a regular basis to make them like you, but only need to insult once or twice to make them dislike you.</p>\n\n<p>But a person who is not used to compliments, a single compliment will be enough to leave a lasting effect?</p>\n\n<p>A dishonest person shows some honest work, does this change your perception towards him? But you see an honest person do some dishonest thing, does that make him dishonest in your eyes?</p>\n\n<p>Are you more likely to not vote for a person based on negative information about him than vote for a person based on some positive information about him?</p>\n\n<p>Does negativity draw more attention? And it makes sense evolutionarily, why it would. We focus more on avoiding risks, detecting cheatings.</p>\n\n<p>What about social media? Do negative things get more attention there or positive things?</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Negativity_bias\" target=\"_blank\">Negative Bias</a></p>\n\n<hr />\n<h2>When We Are Generally Wrong</h2>\n\n<p>X occurred before Y; We think that X caused Y. The (temporal) correlation leads us to believe causation. This is called <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post_hoc_ergo_propter_hoc\" target=\"_blank\">Post Hoc Fallacy</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Example: The Brazilian footballer <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pel%C3%A9\" title=\"PelÃ©\">Pel&eacute;</a> is said to have blamed a dip in his playing performance on having given a fan a specific playing shirt; after getting the shirt back his performance recovered. The loss of the shirt was given as the reason for his dip, and its return the cause of his recovery. However, it was later discovered the shirt returned was not the original shirt.</p>\n\n<p>The Least Effort Principle: describes a typical human behaviour, humans choose a path that offers least resistance. For example, one might consult a generalist co-worker down the hall rather than a specialist in another building, so long as the generalist&#39;s answers were within the threshold of acceptability.</p>\n\n<p>Giving examples of successful people and affirming that some traits are necessary for success.
