While the rest of the Mahabharata is mostly about political play of that age, this scripture contains &quot;spiritual wisdom&quot; for the most part.</p>\n\n<p>This scripture basically contains conversation between Arjuna who is fighting against his own cousins in an epic war, and Krishna who is, even though diplomatic, an incarnation of God. Arjuna, in the middle of the battleground, is in doubt whether he should fight or not.</p>\n\n<p>Reference: <a href=\"http://www.bhagavad-gita.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Bhagavad Gita</a>.</p>\n\n<hr />\n<p><a href=\"http://www.bhagavad-gita.org/Gita/verse-01-29.html\" target=\"_blank\">Arjuna:&nbsp;I don&#39;t want happiness, victory if it comes at cost of my kinsmen.</a></p>\n\n<p>Krishna:</p>\n\n<p>There&#39;s nothing like death, only body dies not the soul.&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.bhagavad-gita.org/Gita/verse-02-13.html\" target=\"_blank\">Transmigration of the soul from one body to another.</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.bhagavad-gita.org/Gita/verse-02-14.html\" target=\"_blank\">Heat, Cold, Pleasure, Pain are temporary.</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.bhagavad-gita.org/Gita/verse-02-15.html\" target=\"_blank\">A person who being equipoised in happiness and distress, makes wise judgement, is eligible for liberation.</a></p>\n\n<p>Time, Eternity, and Soul: <a href=\"http://www.bhagavad-gita.org/Gita/verse-02-16.html\" target=\"_blank\">Verse 2.16</a>, <a href=\"http://www.bhagavad-gita.org/Gita/verse-02-17.html\" target=\"_blank\">Verse 2.17</a>, <a href=\"http://www.bhagavad-gita.org/Gita/verse-02-18.html\" target=\"_blank\">Verse 2.18</a>, <a href=\"http://www.bhagavad-gita.org/Gita/verse-02-19.html\" target=\"_blank\">Verse 2.19</a>, <a href=\"http://www.bhagavad-gita.org/Gita/verse-02-20.html\" target=\"_blank\">Verse 2.20</a>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Birth and Death: <a href=\"http://www.bhagavad-gita.org/Gita/verse-02-21.html\">Verse 2.21</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.bhagavad-gita.org/Gita/verse-02-22.html\">Verse 2.22</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.bhagavad-gita.org/Gita/verse-02-23.html\">Verse 2.23</a></p>\n\n<p>Why Arjuna should not lament &mdash;&nbsp;<strong>given that he is fighting for righteousness</strong> &mdash; The nature of soul is indistructible (Verses: 2.16 to 2.25), Even if there is birth and rebirth death is inevitable (Verses: 2.26 to 2.32), It is a sin not to fight for righteousness and justice (Verses: 2.33 to 2.36)</p>\n\n<p>Actions without desires, Spiritual Intelligence, Equanimity: <a href=\"http://www.bhagavad-gita.org/Gita/verse-02-39.html\">Verse 2.39</a> to 2.52</p>\n\n<p>Existence without desires:&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.bhagavad-gita.org/Gita/verse-02-53.html\">Verse 2.53</a>&nbsp;to&nbsp; <a href=\"http://www.bhagavad-gita.org/Gita/verse-02-71.html\" target=\"_blank\">Verse 2.71</a> (Concentration on sense objects ⟶&nbsp;Desire ⟶ Anger ⟶ Delusion ⟶ Bewilderment of memory ⟶ Loss of spiritual intelligence). No spiritual intelligence&nbsp;⟶ no meditation on Ultimate Truth&nbsp;⟶ no peace&nbsp;⟶ no Happiness. One who has his senses subdued fully from the objects of the senses, is established in perfect knowledge (Verse <a href=\"http://www.bhagavad-gita.org/Gita/verse-02-67.html\" target=\"_blank\">2.67</a>).&nbsp;</p>\n\n<hr />\n<p>If spiritual intelligence is utmost thing, why should Arjuna fight? - <a href=\"http://www.bhagavad-gita.org/Gita/verse-03-03.html\">Verse 3.03</a>&nbsp;to&nbsp; 3.43.</p>\n\n<p>It&#39;s not possible for living beings to not take any action. It&#39;s better to control senses by mind, instead of thinking about them, working sense organs without desire. &quot;Let sacrifice bestow all that is desirable for you&quot; (Verse 3.09 - Verse 3.16) <em>[Has&nbsp;this notion of sacrifice mistaken commonly? Probably not. The verses clearly refer to demi-gods as providers of necessities of life, and as medium to Ultimate Personality. It also mentions sacrifice as cause (or catalyst) of rainfall.]</em>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>One who remains satisfies within, is free from requirement, and effects of activities. Verse 3.17 - 3.18</p>\n\n<p>However, one should perform prescribed (by Vedas) activities to show the world a path for their welfare. Just like Krishna himself does, even though he doesn&#39;t need to do. Verse 3.19 - Verse 3.26</p>\n\n<p>Leave it on Me (Krishna) and perform the activities without any desire, attachment. Verse 3.27 to Verse 3.32</p>\n\n<p>It&#39;s better to perform one&#39;s natural prescribed activities than to perform others&#39; prescribed activities. <em>[Does this mean to act according to your own nature, you don&#39;t have to strain much by adopting others&#39; path e.g. adopting a monastic life if not ready? Senses are bound to have some aversion or attraction, neither of them matters.] </em>Verse 3.33 to Verse 3.35</p>\n\n<p>What is it that makes even intelligent people perform sinful activities? &mdash; Lust. Verse 3.36 to Verse 3.43</p>\n\n<hr />\n<p>Arjuna asks for clarification as in why Krishna is trying to convince him to take horrible action of partaking in war, if spiritual knowledge is so important.</p>\n\n<p>Kirshan says:</p>\n\n<p>Those who know about me, my births, my actions get liberation. Verse 4.2 to 4.14&nbsp; &quot;All mankind follows My path O Arjuna, in all respects&quot; || 4.11 || <em>[Does it mean that everything even evil is Lord&#39;s path]</em></p>\n\n<p>Those who were liberated in past they also performed actions, you should do too, after understanding the intricacies of actions as described in Vedas. &quot;One who realizes the renunciation of action in activities, and action in the renunciation of activities, he is spiritually intelligent among mankind, transcendentally situated a perfect performer of all actions&quot; || 4.18 ||.</p>\n\n<p>Peforming action after leaving all attachments from fruitive actions for sense organs, is as good as doing no action, performing action only for body sustenance.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;The sacrificial paraphenalia is the Ultimate Truth, the sacrificial fire is the Ultimate Truth, offerings of oblations and ghee by the brahmana is the Ultimate Truth; for him being fully absorbed in the Ultimate Truth by spiritual activities; certainly the Ultimate Truth is attainable&quot; || 4.24 ||</p>\n\n<p>Krishna talks about sacrifices that different people, karma-yogies, gyana-yogis, monasts, celibates, households etc make. All of those sacrifices come&nbsp;from action. Without action, guided by Vedas, one will not be happy in this world and won&#39;t be happy in the next one. Actions done in perfect knowledge of Brahman, of Vedic knowledge,&nbsp;without attachment does not aggregate sinful reactions.</p>\n\n<hr />\n<p>Arjuna then asks which one of the ways is best, renunciation of actions or the prescribed (by Vedas) actions.</p>\n\n<p>[Krishna&#39;s main reply: they are not different. Verse <a href=\"http://www.bhagavad-gita.org/Gita/verse-05-04.html\" target=\"_blank\">5.04</a> ]</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Mentally renouncing all fruitive activities, the self-controlled embodied being within the physical body of nine openings; free from thinking he is the actual doer of anything and free from thiking he is the cause of anything resides happily.&quot; || 5.13 ||</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Only those who see with equal vision the Ultimate Truth in a brahmana endowed with Vedic knowledge and humility, in a cow, in an elephant, in a dog and in the lower animal eating members of humanity are learned&nbsp; in genuine wisdom&quot; || 5.17 ||</p>\n\n<p><em>[Can a person actually be free from dualities? If yes, then evil and good are equal to him.]</em></p>\n\n<p>&quot;O Arjuna, those pleasures arising from the senses contacting sense objects are indeed the source of misery only; subject to a beginning and an end; therefore the spiritually intelligent never take delight in them&quot; || 5.21 ||</p>\n\n<p>&quot;That person expelling from the mind unnecessary external sense objects, fixing the eyes between the eyebrows, practicing the suspension of breath control in inhalation and exhalation of air flowing threw the nostrils; such a person is in control of his senses, mind, and spiritual intelligence; being so dedicated to liberation , devoid of desire, fear and anger, this wise one is certainly always factually liberated&quot; || 5.26 ||&nbsp;</p>\n\n<hr />\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n","authorId":null,"subject":"philosophy","tags":null,"img":null,"summary":null,"lastUpdated":"2020-05-01T16:01:25.384+0000"}
