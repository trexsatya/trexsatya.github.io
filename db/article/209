The rules of the gaame are &mdash;&nbsp;in the first phase &mdash;&nbsp;discovered/explored, then &mdash; in the second phase &mdash; they are made immutable. Take for example, the game of chess, the rules of chess are immutable, even if they might not make any sense.</p>\n\n<p>You could say, no they are not immutable. Well, they are for the players of the <em><strong>chess.&nbsp;</strong></em>Now, it is quite possible that some person(s) don&#39;t find the rules of chess sensible, and they modify the rules, and in process they invent a new game, and after some exploration, that new game has immutable rules. This process is perhaps a good summary of what has been going on in terms of social norms.</p>\n\n<hr />\n<p>Isn&#39;t it interesting that, for example, on a guitar every song is available.

[But it doesn&#39;t explain how that sort of fear can create ego, because if that creates ego, then you should also lose the fear of dying. But maybe ego here also refers to a particular form of ego]&nbsp;</p>\n\n<hr />\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/False_flag\">False Flag operations</a>: &quot;In land warfare, such operations are generally deemed acceptable under certain circumstances, such as to deceive enemies providing that the deception is not&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perfidious\" title=\"Perfidious\">perfidious</a>&nbsp;and all such deceptions are discarded before opening fire upon the enemy. &quot;</p>\n\n<p>Seems that there is Ethics involved in warfare.

At one point of time, they seem to be mutually exclusive.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>So, one can imagine, one can intellectualize both the virtues and vices of money, but cannot truly see both of them (their development especially) at the same time, because the conditions required are&nbsp;mutually exclusive.</p>\n\n<hr />\n<p>A Short But Complete Guide To Becoming Adult:</p>\n\n<p>If you are child(-ish) and somehow feel pressured/suggested by the world that you need to become an adult; We present to you an (uniside) interview, with an adult:</p>\n\n<p>Hello! Yes, I am an adult! Aren&#39;t you? Then what are you, you sure don&#39;t look like a child!(?)</p>\n\n<p>Anyway, Let me tell you we adults are completely different from children, well, a lot different if not completely. I mean, we defitely find something funny when someone delivers a joke, and it becomes even funnier if they slide in some sexual words, some insult etc, you know!</p>\n\n<p>But apart from that we are very different from children. Okay, let me just tell you about myself and then you can figure out what&#39;s different, since you are a child, right?</p>\n\n<p>For one thing, I don&#39;t have the innocence that children have.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>I don&#39;t just enjoy something, I plan to make it <em><strong>my own</strong></em>.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>I can tell a lie, or hide something, and not even giggle, or leak any suggestion. And even if someone is able to get a hint, I can strategize even better to become better at hiding.</p>\n\n<p>My games are different from children, I don&#39;t play with toys, or just enjoy some activity, someone&#39;s company, I happen to make plans, I happen to <em>strategize</em>&nbsp;whom should I play with, where do I get the maximum amount of pleasure, not only for now but also which can help me develop a relationship that will help me later. My games are based on playing with emotions, secretive actions. I don&#39;t just say what&#39;s on my mind, I frame it in a way that will give me advantage. Yes, I am very fond of advantage.</p>\n\n<p>You see, I can use anything to my advantage. I practice it and I become better at it.</p>\n\n<p>I can use not only <em>things</em> to my advantage, but also people. When I see someone, I don&#39;t just see a person, I see opportunity, and it&#39;s not something that <em>I</em> do, it&#39;s &quot;natural&quot;, it&#39;s automatic. I engage with a person not just to be, but to form a relationship, for various reasons you know, like a relationship that will help me &quot;grow&quot;, help my &quot;business&quot; grow.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>I don&#39;t just care about here and now, I care about future as well. You see, I am very fond of security. I want security, and this doesn&#39;t mean security from harmful animals only, but also from anything that could happen, also from that is unlike me, or a sitution not desirable to me.</p>\n\n<p>You look confused! Hah! You dumbass children!</p>\n\n<p>Anyway, here&#39;s a better word to describe it - Control. I want control. I want things to be my way, I want to control everything, I want control over animals, not only harmful but also weak ones, especially the weak ones. I want control nature.</p>\n\n<p>You see when I look at a tree, or something that&#39;s part of nature, I don&#39;t just look at the thing. I look at something that cane be controlled, transformed into something else which will provide me more of security and control.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<hr />\n<p>About Free-Will</p>\n\n<p>Two angles to look at it.</p>\n\n<p>1. Everything is caused by something, so we can say that no effect is free from causes. When we make conscious choice, there are unconscious factors involved. Unconscious factors are based on a lot of events, including physical events within and outside body. Hence, apparently no will is completely free. But there is another way to look at it, which involves complexity. In a complex system, even though the current state is dependent on the past states, one cannot predict the future states. So, in a way, future state is &quot;free&quot; from the present state. And, a simple manifestation of this appears in case of fractals.</p>\n\n<p>2. From another angle, this question that whether free-will exists or not becomes futile. Here&#39;s how:</p>\n\n<p>If you combine Plato&#39;s Allegory of The Cave, with a movie named &quot;The Trueman Show&quot;, you can see that reality is always an illusion. Why always? Because at any layer, you don&#39;t expect that there&#39;s an outer layer, and yet you cannot prove it. So, you can <em>accept</em> that the illusion itself is reality, and the ultimate reality will be the layer beyond which you don&#39;t have mechanism to go. Which means that your reality is an illusion, and if the reality itself is an illusion, then free-will being an illusion could itself be an illusion. So, the question becomes futile in the shadow of another question, &quot;Is the reality an illusion?&quot;.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<hr />\n<p>Santa Fe Courses MOOC:&nbsp;https://www.complexityexplorer.org/courses</p>\n\n<hr />\n<p>At the root of all problems lies our quest for pleasure. As a dark example, take slavery, there were two forms of slavery, those who used slaves for some work, and if they had little sense they understood that a slave needed to be given life-preserving resources in order to gain maximum ouput, which would be pretty much the same as now the way jobs work. The other was where slave owners took pleasure from the agony of slaves, they didn&#39;t care much about maximum output.</p>\n\n<p>We are seeing so much peace right now in the world, is it going to continue for a very long time (forget &#39;always&#39;)?&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>What reason do we have to believe so, when it is clear that our drive for pleasure has not changed much, in fact the whole cultural lifestyle is making humans more slave to their desires. Every single item on market is up for making you more of a slave to desires.</p>\n\n<hr />\n<p>Inevitable forces of Capitalism....</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://youtu.be/2GFaN9-1iz0?t=1607\">https://youtu.be/2GFaN9-1iz0?t=1607</a></p>\n\n<p>How long would it take Capitalism to go into such areas?

They have no correspondence to anything observed. And, yet it has been present in human cognition for like forever..&nbsp;<br />\nSo, it can be said that these concepts are built into the fabric of human cognition. So is God, you can say that it&#39;s imagination, but actually it&#39;s just built into fabric of human cognition.&nbsp;<br />\nBut yeah, personal God seems like imagination of first form, as evident by gods in various cultures.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<hr />\n<p>When you deal with a lot, it becomes easy to forget the most simple and the most important things.

Clearly, fear is not helpful.</p>\n\n<hr />\n<p>Jim Carrey says, &quot;(When you go into&nbsp; the character deep enough) If it is so easy to lose Jim Carrey, then who the hell is Jim Carrey&quot;</p>\n\n<p>You can realise this thing by other means as well. How easy it is to lose &#39;yourself&#39; under the influence of intoxicants. There are some aspects of you that persist through intoxicated state more than others.

And it becomes clear if you have some context of the world around those dates.</p>\n\n<p>But any/much context, when I studied dates in school it seemed toturous.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>But how would you give context to early year students? - There can be many techniques, one can be to make them think about their local history (family, locality, city etc), another can be simply remind them (make them wonder) how close or far off that date is.

And what&#39;s interesting is that both of them focus on the same thing - life. Some say that all these technological advancements like AI/AGI, Extra-terrestrial Life&nbsp;etc are all necessary because we know that Earth is not going to be habitable forever, we need a Plan-B. So, basically they are thinking about continuing Life as we know it. Some say that these technologies are life-threatening. So, they are also thinking about Life as we know it.</p>\n\n<p>I guess the first type of people are more brave in exploring the possibilities probably because they&nbsp;are not content with the current situation of Life, or probably because they have more fear of Death deep down, I have a skepticism that they really care what is going to happen to the human species after let&#39;s say 1000 years in the future. The second type of people want to focus on what they&#39;ve got from nature already.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>And then there are third type of people who are ignorant of all these things going on!&nbsp;</p>\n\n<hr />\n<p>A learning from Software Development:</p>\n\n<p>Some people complain about usage of frameworks, and how they have been growing in number. They are more likely to encourage people to skip/forget the fundamentals and hence cause damage.</p>\n\n<p>The same principle can apply in life as well. With all the modern toys that keep people busy, they get overwhelmed with it, and things start owning them.</p>\n\n<p>Now, if you try to tell someone to discourage using the frameworks, they are clearly not gonna listen to you. And even if someone listens and believes you, they might not be able to follow this advice. So, the middleway for developers is: use fraeworks, but try to customize it often, that way you&#39;d be forced to learn the fundamentals of the frameworks.</p>\n\n<p>Similarly, the middleway for life is: do whatever you want to do or have to do. But try to practice minimalism often.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<hr />\n<p>I find a lot of similarities between seemingly unrelated events and concepts. An example, you see nowadays information flooding all around. People are exchanging so many motivational quotes and stories for success. But not everyone who reads them get inspired (at least to a significant degree). What&#39;s going on there? The person is getting the relevant motivation, information etc and still no impact?&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Now take the same structure of event and apply it to what happens when and if people are informed about virtues and ethics. Socrates (through the writings of Plato) said that a person will automatically do the right thing if he knows what&#39;s right.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>What I am seeing here is that even if a person has the information about what&#39;s &quot;right&quot; he might not do it.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>There&#39;s a different set of configuration required for each possibility, be it striving for success, striving for peace/contentment, striving for morality, striving for hedonistic/irresponsible pleasures, or whatever.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>And even if a person comes to see what is right and what is wrong, choosing to do the right thing takes an immense amount of energy, the lack of which will result in the person settling for the &quot;wrong&quot; anyway.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>What does it mean?&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Well, not much. Just the same old philosophy that there are two forces in nature good, and evil. And will continue!&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>But I am interested in conversions between good and evil.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<hr />\n<p>My expectations from Technology, Science and &quot;Progress&quot;:</p>\n\n<p>We have seen tremendous progress in technology in recent years (not so much in science though). And we thought that technology will enlighten (Western enlightenment) people.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<hr />\n<p>I was trying to clear my thoughts regarding education, and I found that there&#39;s an important distinction that needs to be made between just&nbsp;<em>education</em>&nbsp;and education referred as in education-system. Seems silly right? But I think the problem is that the word&nbsp; &quot;education&quot; does not represent the same thing in both contexts. There&#39;s hardly ever any effort in terms of education. There&#39;s lot of effort in education-system&#39;s education. Education can not be done by any organized system, unless you everyone settles on some clear guidelines for life and stick to that. Education is tightly connected to life. Whatever direction the life goes in, education must go. Whatever priorities life takes, education must help. Education cannot be responsibility of one particular group or person. Everyone must take part in a person&#39;s education - parents, neighbors, friends, relatives, teachers etc. On the other hand, educaiton as referred in education-system is only meant for keeping the established system running, and it can be handled by some particular group e.g. teachers.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>To people who talk about Truth, if I really seek truth, I can pick fault in almost all statements. But that would not be likeable to you. It&#39;s quite clear, that it&#39;s not about truth, it never has been.</p>\n\n<p><strong>On Development:</strong></p>\n\n<p>We have seen tremendous development in recent years of human history, so much so that we don&#39;t even have any idea where the technological development will take us in coming years. Personally, during my own life, things have changed so much from childhood to now.</p>\n\n<p>But when we say &#39;development&#39;, we are not being precise, and hence not being honest. The point is that we have seen tremendous development but only on one facet, on materialistic level.&nbsp;We now have more comfort, more gadgets, more <strong><em>toys</em></strong>&nbsp;in one form or another.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>The best outcome of this sort of development that I won&#39;t argue, is the increase in life-saving medical technology. (And I know the development of medical technology is linked with other technologies in some way, but that&#39;s beside the point).</p>\n\n<p>If you see on human leve, psychological level, spiritual level, there has been <strong><em>zero</em></strong>&nbsp;development (Note: I&#39;m not saying this on the basis of data). People still live their life driven by the same fundamental psychological forces, and people will always will (probably). But the&nbsp; question is which forces of psyche are&nbsp; prevalent, more potent overall in&nbsp; the human civilization. <em>Is it love, is it compassion, is it natural happiness, is&nbsp; it peace and pure energy?</em> I won&#39;t say ccoperation (because co-operation is secondary, even two enemies might cooperate sometimes). <em>Is it fear? Is it jealousy? Is it pride, feeling&nbsp;of superiority? Is it prejudice? Is it envy? Is it fear of loneliness? Is it demand for conformity&nbsp;and validations?</em></p>\n\n<p>One might give example of how we have been peaceful, we have had no war for over 50 years. I would like to invoke a thought experiment then:</p>\n\n<p><em>Suppose you find that a virus has entered in your body, and you fall sick. But after a few days of sickness, you get better. But by every possible mean you know that the virus is still there in the body. What would you say then, has it really gotten better? Is there a progress? Maybe the virus is on hiatus, it&#39;s mutating, and it will strike back.</em></p>\n\n<p>You see our whole life, and hence the whole journey of humanity in general is being driven by the same elements. There&#39;s no real development at all.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>On Pride:</strong></p>\n\n<p>This is a recurring theme, a pattern in society overall: Pride, and Feeling of Superiority. The feeling&nbsp;could be result of money, education, talent etc. People feel themselves superior to some of the others, and it seems that it is necessary&nbsp;for their stable existence. You could write/read books about pride, why it is necessary and so on. What I feel though&nbsp;is that&nbsp;those who feel superior, or proud are stupid in one dimension, even if a <em>genius</em> in other dimensions.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>If you analyse the cause and effect of all the events and in this world, you&#39;ll see that every effect has a cause. Combined with the fact that sometimes seemingly minor causes can result in&nbsp;major effects, the whole web/network of&nbsp;cause-effect becomes too complex to analyse. And again, if you analyse the&nbsp;events going on with you internally, you&#39;d find that there&#39;s a&nbsp;cause for each&nbsp;of your mental&nbsp;state, and at some point the&nbsp;cause is beyond your control (or even your attention).&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Overall, whether there&#39;s free-will or not, the fact is that your current state is a function&nbsp;of a lot of states and events beyond your own control (or even&nbsp;your attention). You can make yourself happy by assuming&nbsp; that <strong><em>you</em></strong> achieved something, or that&nbsp;<strong><em>you</em></strong> made a wrong decision in&nbsp;life&nbsp;and so on. But this&nbsp;happiness, this stability of your self, when&nbsp;comes at cost of obvious (observational) facts, and is reinforced again&nbsp;and again,&nbsp;the happiness not even remains the main driving factor&nbsp;any longer. Pride, Superiority complex, Looking down at others, Looking yourself as provider and others as consumers, and so on, all these things become a force in themselves.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>But the &quot;truth&quot; doesn&#39;t matter to many. So, even then when someone looks down at someone else and feels superior,&nbsp;why doesn&#39;t he/she think that at the same time there are people superior to them?&nbsp;Why doesn&#39;t that fact neautralize their&nbsp;feeling of superiority? &mdash; Ignorance, and because those forces that were developed by reinforcement have become stronger than their core psyche.</p>\n\n<p>If they can&#39;t find anyone superior, they should notice that despite their possession (of money, education or talent) they <em>require</em> something <em>desperately</em> &mdash;&nbsp;&nbsp;external validation, so called <em>&quot;respect&quot;,&nbsp;</em>and there are people who don&#39;t even&nbsp; require that. Why don&#39;t they consider that this requirement of theirs trumps what they&nbsp;possess.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>You can expand the same to groups/classes, and see that group feelings of superiority has similar stupidity.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<hr />\n<p>A poem in progress:</p>\n\n<p>Philosophers Last Moments:</p>\n\n<p>[God appears and says] Fool, you spent your whole life in images [insert a word for abstraction, close to image], and ignoring the beauty of the world, the people, the trees, the oceans, the mountains, the maginficant achievements of people. [Philosopher] smiled and said, you too are an image, aren&#39;t you? Half of the world is running after you, for you, on the commands of you, and yet you never appeared among those people, those mountains and trees. Now I&#39;ve seen both you and the beauty created by you. No repentance!</p>\n\n<hr />\n<p>Do plants have life? Do mountains have life? Do stones have life?</p>\n\n<p>Absolutely not. It&#39;s silly to say that they have life. Right?</p>\n\n<p>OK. But with more and more science what we are discovering is that you, me also function almost in the same way as machines do. Only thing is that you, me have more complex machinary and more properties.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>To me, sometimes it seems that even humans do not have life. They are just some sort of processing.</p>\n\n<p>On other times, it seems that even plants have life. Maybe the life perceived outside in other entities depends on the amount of life that is within me. And I can imagine an extreme possibility, when I am so full of life that everything that I touch by perception also seems to have life.</p>\n\n<p>Maybe similarly the amount of intelligence within decides what intelligence (and in which entities) I perceive outside.</p>\n\n<hr />\n<p>I have long been confused about what is right and wrong. Logic fails in most of the scenarios when it comes to making decision about right and wrong.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>But now I have theory which can solve it for most of the scenarios. It depends on complexity. More complexity some action generates, more chances there are that it would be wrong. Take lying for example: Is it wrong to lie? Everyone would agree that some small lies which do not cause some harm are fine, are not wrong. Although this demands&nbsp;further analysis, what is harm, what degree of harm, and how much this small lie can contribute to bigger lies, or how much subtle effects can this lie has etc. This analysis demands a lot. Our minds has intrinsic capacity to identify what is complex and what is not. If our minds sees no (or very little)compexity related to some action, the action can be considered good.</p>\n\n<p>Let&#39;s test it on something that is very hard problem. What about something like Euthanasia? If it gets to a point where there&#39;s no complexity involved, it is not wrong to help someone die who is suffering. What does the complexity mean here? These are the examples: the person who is suffering wants to die, but is not completely sure. There are relatives which want him to not suffer, but are not sure about the action. In case of complexity, it would be considered wrong.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<hr />\n<p>https://www.pitt.edu/~jdnorton/teaching/HPS_0410/chapters/index.html</p>\n\n<p>There are few &#39;sometimes&#39; which are not very obvious:-</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>Sometimes people help others in order to be help themselves</li>\n\t<li>Sometimes people would never have fallen in love, had they not heard the word love.</li>\n\t<li>Sometimes you don&#39;t really like the things you think you like</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>https://jsxgraph.uni-bayreuth.de/wiki/index.php/Documentation Use this to create animations for Euclid&#39;s Elements.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/~karl/\">https://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/~karl/</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://patrick.maher1.net/317/lectures/\">http://patrick.maher1.net/317/lectures/</a></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Cooperation based Economy:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20131105113916/http://bnp.binghamton.edu/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/Ostrom-2010-Polycentric-Governance.pdf\">https://web.archive.org/web/20131105113916/http://bnp.binghamton.edu/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/Ostrom-2010-Polycentric-Governance.pdf</a></p>\n\n<hr />\n<p>&quot;By a small sample we may judge of the whole piece, Miguel de Cervantes &ldquo;Don Quixote.&rdquo; This supports my doubt that all this data-oriented thinking is gonna contribute to stereotyping.</p>\n\n<hr />\n<p>I need only two things capability to fill my stomach [with food] when I need, empty my mind when I want.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<hr />\n<p>Problem of banalization.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<hr />\n<p>I&#39;m really a stupid person. People want to become leaders, and here I am wanting to end the necessity for leadership.</p>\n\n<hr />\n<p>I&#39;m a slow learner, it took me really long time to figure out why all these gurus (from all realms) expound so much when there&#39;s very little to say in actuality, why everyone is trying so much to emphasize the theories that they believe in. It&#39;s not that they cannot grasp the counter-theory, or that they don&#39;t realize that what they know is not the whole truth, or that it&#39;s not even truth, or that nothing is truth. It&#39;s because for learning it takes attachment, to form the attachment they have to expound so much, link their ideas with as much aspects of life as possible. All of this for what? One thing is that they are also instruments of ideas, just like bodies of each organism are instruments of genes. The other thing could be that whatever truth they have found or believe in, they need support for that, and they would do everything in their capacity to gain support. And the basis of all this is attachment.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>All those saints, is/was there any real significance to them?<br />\nWhat is the significance of any of your relation? with your parents, spouse etc?<br />\nYou can see it in terms of consequences, impact on you. You can also see it in terms of mechanism. You can ask the objective, metaphysical/ontological questions like does my love really exist for my spouse, or for my parents?<br />\nSo, if a saint serves some purpose for the people associated, then how can we deny his significance any less than significance of our other relations?<br />\nAnother question worth asking his why even need for this?<br />\nSo, the need for your parent&#39;s association is development, need for spouse&#39;s association is sustainance and propagation of life. In both cases, there&#39;s something lacking in you which these relations serve. In the same way, there must be something lacking in those people who associate themselves with saints.<br />\nYou can say that they also associate because of unknown (and stupid) fear, or because an impractical hope.<br />\nThere&#39;re two ways to look at this then:&nbsp;<br />\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;1. Yes, but you&#39;ll find that fear, and expectation also present in your other associations. You can then say that but their expectations and fear is irrational. That goes into a deeper question: what&#39;s even rational, why any fear is needed, why any life is needed, why some person has one sort of expectation, fear, passion, and another person some different version of it. Why do we lack anything at all? Why are there emotions at all? etc<br />\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;2. Even if that&#39;s true that their fears, expectations are irrational, the association serves some purpose. Which is all that matters to those people. You can say that they need to upgrade themselves. But, then the question is that can you downgrade yourself to their level? If not, then why expect them to upgrade? There are transformations happening obviously, but transformation is a process so complex that someone&#39;s suggestion is of very effect.</p>\n\n<p>Is it even possible to love everybody as claimed by/for those saints?<br />\nChoose the person you love the most. Imagine they get hurt, would you feel pain/sorrow? Why? There&#39;s no physical/mechanical association between you two. The other person can be poles apart, and you would still feel the pain? Why? Because, it&#39;s generated by your mind. Now, your mind must have some mechanism, some condition that must be satisfied to generate that sort of love. Imagine if those conditions are very limited, so limited that almost everyone satisifies them. Then your mind can generate love for almost everyone.</p>\n\n<hr />\n<p>Tricks of Carl Jung<br />\nhttps://www.youtube.com/embed/Ed3vPb9bmcw?start=1112&amp;end=1287</p>\n\n<p>Carl Jung on archetype<br />\nhttps://www.youtube.com/embed/Ed3vPb9bmcw?start=1838&amp;end=1989&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Jung on Archetype, and its projection and the resulting experience<br />\nhttps://www.youtube.com/embed/Ed3vPb9bmcw?start=2681&amp;end=3018</p>\n\n<p>Double Personality, Jung predicted something catastrophic will happen in Germany before Nazis rose (by interpretation of unconscious dreams of his patients),&nbsp;<br />\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bs3HK3pxVAY&amp;t=53s</p>\n\n<p><br />\nWe use introvert and extrovert commonly to describe moods etc, but the motivation of Jung coming up with these was slightly different:-<br />\nTo say that person who goes by the external sense perceptions, by society is more valid than the man who goes by subjective factors, is wrong, prejudiced.&nbsp;<br />\nSubjective factors are as much of truth as the matter that everyone sees. A person is not born tabula rasa, he has a world within.<br />\nhttps://www.youtube.com/embed/bs3HK3pxVAY&amp;t?start=1065&amp;end=1440</p>\n\n<p>Introvert, Extrovert do not define a person, they just express the person&#39;s tendency to be influenced more by the environment or by the subjecctive world.</p>\n\n<p>What is the difference between telling a person to find the solutions for life himself,<br />\nv/s<br />\nBringing him to the point where he realises that he has to find the solution himself?</p>\n\n<div>\n<h2 id=\"stereotyping\">Stereotyping</h2>\n\n<p><br />\nStereotyping:<br />\nWhat are stereotypes?</p>\n</div>\n\n<p>Why are stereotypes born?</p>\n\n<p>What are the implications of stereotypes?<br />\nOn one hand, it gives you an easy way of categorisation which can be helpful in some cases. E.g. by the stereotyping of man being physically stronger than woman, you will choose a man to do a physical task instead of a woman.<br />\nAnd, perhaps, most of the time your decision will turn out to be correct, you didn&#39;t waste time by trying with the woman.<br />\nBut there are deeper impacts of this. While this proved useful in some scenarios (or, even most of the scenarios), it gradually started guiding the development of women&nbsp;<br />\nwithin the framework of that stereotype.&nbsp;<br />\nAnd, as you have seen in the past, none of the stereotypes is immune to change, at some point of time there will be demand to fix the stereotype. And you see,<br />\nthe more the stereotype has been exercised, the more impactful it has been, the harder it will be change, the bigger revolution it will demand, and more havoc it will cause.</p>\n\n<p>You might say that man has advanced so much in intellect that such mistakes will not happen. But remember, the world has always been intelligent enough as seen from the present time as point of reference i.e. our previous generations would have thought the same thing.&nbsp;<br />\nPlus, the world is not run by intellect as much as by feelings and emotions.<br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n\n<hr />\n<p class=\"mentions-texteditor__content\">I know what I really want now in my life. I want to develop methodoglogies which can automatically develop intutions.</p>\n\n<hr />\n<p class=\"mentions-texteditor__content\">Is understanding even the main thing in mind. It feels that belief is more fundamental thing. Look at this: I see videos of these philosophers, found their theory and idea. Now if I go read their books, the same thing that they told in a compressed manner will be linked through many pieces, and extensive explanations which when registered in mind gives me an illusion of understanding.</p>\n\n<p class=\"mentions-texteditor__content\">Here&#39;s what I observe in understanding: my find has already accepted some things, and then tries to make connection of new data, concepts by pivoting against those accepted facts.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"mentions-texteditor__content\">But, during that process all I have done is formed multiple logical connections reaching the same thing. Is that what understanding is about? Forming logical pathways? Then, the main thing is not these pathways, but the terminal node which is understanding. And what&#39;s interesting is that you can have this terminal node ahead of the logical progression, or as a result of the logical progression. It&#39;s still the same thing.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"mentions-texteditor__content\">And, in case when you do not have a (or, more) terminal node(s), you don&#39;t have anything. Not even understanding.</p>\n\n<hr />\n<p class=\"mentions-texteditor__content\">It&#39;s childish&nbsp;to dichotomize people.</p>\n\n<p class=\"mentions-texteditor__content\">Take for example, dichotomy of materialist and immaterialist. When Roger Pensrose was asked about this, he replied &quot;I used to call myself materialist, but I now I don&#39;t understand what is material&quot;</p>\n\n<hr />\n<p class=\"mentions-texteditor__content\">Picturisation of existential crisis:-</p>\n\n<p class=\"mentions-texteditor__content\">Imagine that in your house, there&#39;s a room to which you never really paid attention to. This is not a house that you built consciously, it&#39;s a house that you got, it just was there, and you found yourself living in that house. Sometime it just happened that you opened this neglected room, and as you go into this room and spend some time, something bizzare happens; you start questioning everything. So far you never worried about how you got into the house, you just lived there enjoying the parts of it, but now you start questioning where did the house come from, how did I get into this house, why am I living here, why is it (the house) even there, and so forth. You find yourself into bizzare situation. Fortunately you get pulled out of this room. You try to get back to your normal days, but you can&#39;t undo your experience with that room, and you still living the house.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"mentions-texteditor__content\">Now, if this doesn&#39;t sound like your story in any regard, you are lucky that you never came across that room in your house, or that room has a heavy, strong lock on it. If you are lucky enough, you will get through your whole life without ever opening that room.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<hr />\n<p class=\"mentions-texteditor__content\">It&#39;s best to keep physical and spiritual separate. Mathematics is the best language for physical domain, silence is the best language for spiritual domain. Mathematical and scientific advancement is not only necessary, it&#39;s given, we can&#39;t stop it, we may try to enhance it. But expecting that mathematical and scientific advancement is going to solve everything. As long as &quot;you&quot; are there, you&#39;ll have same problems, degree might be different, form might be different, but on a fundamental level it will remain the same.</p>\n\n<hr />\n<p class=\"mentions-texteditor__content\">I don&#39;t know what this feeling is. It seems that it&#39;s stopping me from just &#39;being there&#39;, there&#39;s a disquiteness in the mind... when I don&#39;t meditate..</p>\n\n<hr />\n<p class=\"mentions-texteditor__content\">It seems ridiculous that a person who is convicted of an attempt to&nbsp;murder receives less punishment than a person who has committed a murder successfully. It&#39;s like we are rewarding the person for a failure. Furthermore, we are rewarding (reinforcing) development of his murder skills. It can also be seen as if the law is&nbsp;giving the person a second chance.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<hr />\n<p class=\"mentions-texteditor__content\">Stop the mind, watch the body.

What does even &quot;empty&quot; mean? Can a glass be half full without being half empty? What is reality, the emptiness or the fullness? - (Philosophers, mostly Western)</p>\n\n<p class=\"mentions-texteditor__content\">We can see that &quot;there is something that is holding some water. We can use that water in some ways. That&#39;s it.&quot; - &quot;Enlightened&quot; people.</p>\n\n<p class=\"mentions-texteditor__content\">We can see that glass, water, half and full are all illusions created by mind. - Easter Philosophers.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<hr />\n<p class=\"mentions-texteditor__content\">The power law is seen everywhere.

We teach all these things to people in schools and colleges without giving any meaning to this (if I&#39;m not mistaken), solving equations which don&#39;t mean anything, without a sense of wonder or appreciation (doesn&#39;t matter if pristigious institutes do it, if it is being taught anywhere it has to mean something, otherwise you are wasting precious life of people).&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"mentions-texteditor__content\">People after setting their foot on the jounrey of learning, there&nbsp;would turn out to be a particular set of aspects of reality which a particular person would admire the most. What are those:-</p>\n\n<ol>\n\t<li class=\"mentions-texteditor__content\">The explanations of why is it like this (<em>it</em>&nbsp;includes physical, biological phenomena)</li>\n\t<li class=\"mentions-texteditor__content\">The explanations of what can we do with it (<em>it</em>&nbsp;includes physical objects, biological entitites)</li>\n\t<li class=\"mentions-texteditor__content\">The explanations of thoughts</li>\n\t<li class=\"mentions-texteditor__content\">The explanations of interactions (among physical, biological entities)</li>\n\t<li class=\"mentions-texteditor__content\">....</li>\n</ol>\n\n<hr />\n<p class=\"mentions-texteditor__content\">How do we move towards a system, of which Totalitarianism is the pinnacle? &mdash; When someone gains some new insight and sees that things are not going in a &quot;good&quot; way, they try to express it to the general public. But the general public is not interested in it, or doesn&#39;t understand it. So, they form groups of thoughtful people who understand this. Together with people of power (by influencing them) they apply these insights to create a system and impose it on the general public......</p>\n\n<hr />\n<p class=\"mentions-texteditor__content\">I will try my best not to use the phrases like &quot;I think that ... &quot;, &quot;I know that ...&quot; Instead would say &quot;There&#39;s a view that....&quot;</p>\n\n<p class=\"mentions-texteditor__content\">It is a well known phenomenon that the language, the choice of the words affects thought process. Using these I-centric phrases induces Cognitive Dissonance when views are challenged, or when updated information comes, it re-inforces the ego. How can &quot;I&quot; think or know, when what I know changes with more information, more contemplation.</p>\n\n<hr />\n<p class=\"mentions-texteditor__content\">Remember this: Emotions are not part of the soul, they are products of the body interacting&nbsp;with the environment along with the complex internal processing of thoughts, experiences and memory.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"mentions-texteditor__content\">The body can be controlled, hence we can use the body to control emotions as well. The mind also can be used to command the processing of the mind itself, the body and as well as the emotions. All this can be explored through Yoga and Meditation.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<hr />\n<p class=\"mentions-texteditor__content\">Anything that you do has two aspects: One aspect is that you are doing it to <em>escape</em> what you are, what life is - the emptiness. The other aspect is to <em>enhance</em> yourself, enhance life.</p>\n\n<p class=\"mentions-texteditor__content\">You are in a circle anyway whether you are enhancing or escaping at a point of time. The circle is caused by thought, desire.</p>\n\n<hr />\n<p class=\"mentions-texteditor__content\">For transferring knowledge to a person, or rather help a person discover some knowledge, we first need to understand the person himself. How does he perceive things, can he focus on abstractions, or is he just able to focus on concrete. Can he swim across an unfamiliar territory, or does he need a guided field with some final objective (e.g. in that we should start from the current state of our knowledge about reality, and then teach him how we arrived here). What kind of analogies does he need (because analogies are the foundation of understanding)..</p>\n\n<p class=\"mentions-texteditor__content\">But the main problem is dichotomization. First, it&#39;s not easy, second it will never be accurate, since people can change also. However, the range of possible change is limited. How do we find that?</p>\n\n<hr />\n<p class=\"mentions-texteditor__content\">If a person treats some (selected) people in a very nice way, but not others. Does it make him/her a good person?

A person will always treat some in a nice way, as necessitated by social games.</p>\n\n<hr />\n<p class=\"mentions-texteditor__content\">Why is it that some people are more moved by one facet of the idea, but not the other? E.g. for the idea of stealing for example, there is also the idea of non-stealing. Then why does a person just stick to the first one, why is he under the influence of it? - Because it is his habit. Of course the reason given is the benefit that it brings about, which in turn is for bringing happiness. But that sort of happiness is itself just an idea, why not the other ideas of happiness? There is an idea that happiness is in non-stealing, doing good etc...</p>\n\n<hr />\n<p class=\"mentions-texteditor__content\">Same problems&nbsp;different solutions &mdash; Everything fades away, each object of pleasure becomes non-pleasant. Even love fades away.</p>\n\n<p class=\"mentions-texteditor__content\">Indian philosophers&#39;&nbsp;solution:&nbsp;when everything, even love, fails, that,&nbsp;man finds out&nbsp;how vain, how dream-like is this world. Renunciate this world, and seek what&#39;s beyond, or beneath, all this.</p>\n\n<p class=\"mentions-texteditor__content\">Others&#39;&nbsp;solution: one object of pleasure has stopped being pleasant? Find another object that is pleasant. Love faded away? Find someone new to love. Simple.

What happens when you don&#39;t &quot;want&quot; and &quot;need&quot; anything other than food, and you are getting that?</p>\n\n<p class=\"mentions-texteditor__content\">At that time a person is free to explore everything that is already there, rather than invent silly games. What is already there? - There is your body and your consciousness. Sages have spent their lives exploring&nbsp;these two.</p>\n\n<p class=\"mentions-texteditor__content\">At that time a person can give&nbsp;his 100% to whatever he is doing. The action born out of such person is free, pure, holy. At that time if a person helps someone, that is not for some self-fullfilment. At that time if a person appreciates someone, that is not a game of reciprocity. At that time, when the person loves someone, that love is not a game of reciprocity, that love is selfless, full of joy and joy only.</p>\n\n<p class=\"mentions-texteditor__content\">What&#39;s there to attain? - The capacities of the body, the capacities of the mind, and what&#39;s beyond mind. What&#39;s beyond mind? - One has to find out by themselves. To find out one has to systemattically reach a stage where a person can see the waking world, the sleep world, the unconscious world simultaneously.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"mentions-texteditor__content\">Is it even possible? - Why not?</p>\n\n<hr />\n<p class=\"mentions-texteditor__content\"><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g27s8Ligsww\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g27s8Ligsww</a></p>\n\n<p class=\"mentions-texteditor__content\">I love how our stories potray that people change so easily E.g. in stories of Premchand (<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZASx0nRBBI\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZASx0nRBBI</a>), in the story of Buddha and Angulimala, in the story of Valmiki etc...</p>\n\n<p class=\"mentions-texteditor__content\">While in the world that is visible in front of us, people consume daily dose of motivation, sarcasm etc, yet hardly every change.</p>\n\n<hr />\n<p class=\"mentions-texteditor__content\">&quot;Do what you love and love what you do&quot;</p>\n\n<p class=\"mentions-texteditor__content\">Can we take this analogous to &quot;Find who you love, and love who have found&quot;?</p>\n\n<p class=\"mentions-texteditor__content\">Both of them are circular.</p>\n\n<hr />\n<p class=\"mentions-texteditor__content\">Maybe it&#39;s a good way to take money from the rich and give it to poor for the stability of society. But if this is not happening by virtuous will of the rich, indirectly it is going to cause more (and perhaps different) issues for the poor. Because, no doubt the rich have more tools available to them to manipulate the whole game, and if they internally feel robbed (even at the subconscious level) of their rights, they are going to play their tricks to move ahead in the game.</p>\n\n<p class=\"mentions-texteditor__content\">This is also a clear reason that top-down approaches &mdash; alone &mdash; will not help the world much. What does the world want? What is its goal? &mdash; The same as what every form of life does, from ant to men, to preserve itself and to thrive (<em>for which peace is a requirement all along</em>).</p>\n\n<hr />\n<p class=\"mentions-texteditor__content\">Why is it that people lose interest in science even though they employ methods of inference continuously in their life? Is it because it seems so distant to their life, that they are not able to relate with it? Is it because it&#39;s too complicated?</p>\n\n<hr />\n<p class=\"mentions-texteditor__content\">Why do we not love to see the struntmen in action as much as we see our favourite actors been projected to do those stunts? - Because we love combination of qualities as per our combination, furthermore we do not love people, we love qualities, but only in the proportion that suits our taste.</p>\n\n<hr />\n<p class=\"mentions-texteditor__content\">We are very swift in avoiding responsibilites by assuming one theory as the absolute truth, whether it be the Universalism, or ultimate God, or Nihilism or whatever. It seems that we just want security. What if we do not stick to any particular idea or beleif? - It becomes very hard, it could be exausting before it, if ever, becomes liberating. So, how does one conduct a life while living in uncertainties? By developing a sense of discipline and responsibility. You shouldn&#39;t teach children that the world is made by God, or that we know that there&#39;s no God, no meaning, we are just a result of random mutations with no inherent purpose or meaning (even if it&#39;s true, let them find out by themselves). But teach them to conduct their life in a respectable manner, to respect themsleves, as well as others, induce the sense of oneness (since the theory of oneness is not going to be comphrehended by them).&nbsp;</p>\n\n<hr />\n<p class=\"mentions-texteditor__content\">For a person who thinks, if he has done something bad, the guilt itself becomes the most severe punishment, and if he has done something good, the satisfaction of having done itself becomes the best reward.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<hr />\n<p class=\"mentions-texteditor__content\">The strength of a collection, a society, a body etc is not exactly equal to the strength of its strongest part, but rather the strength of the weakest part. Society needs to meditate on this fact.</p>\n\n<hr />\n<p class=\"mentions-texteditor__content\">This drive for happiness - some people are even getting convinced by the neurological findings in the brains of meditators/monks that meditation is the way to go. The main point of these real monks is like dissolve the ego, the &quot;me&quot;. But if you try to do this you, even if you do something good, it might not actually make you happy, because you are still doing it for &quot;your&quot; happiness. On the other hand, if you don&#39;t try it won&#39;t come to you anyway.</p>\n\n<p class=\"mentions-texteditor__content\">So, how does one break this vicious circle?</p>\n\n<p class=\"mentions-texteditor__content\">I take a simple example of alarm clocks. When you set your alarm at some time in the morning. When the alarm goes off and you hear it, initially you will turn off the alarm and there&#39;s a high chance you will go back to sleep. If you continue doing this, there are two possibilities - at some point, you will start waking up at time, OR you will create a new habit where the alarm does not affect you. The same dynamics of the will works in the case above.</p>\n\n<hr />\n<p class=\"mentions-texteditor__content\">The world is just becoming complex, with the same fragments of pain, suffering, love, stealing, etc.. It just becomes more and more harder to distinguish evil from evil, good from non-good. All those things that ever existed, would always exist, the fabrics, the basics... It just becomes harder to spot them.</p>\n\n<hr />\n<p class=\"mentions-texteditor__content\">I&#39;m quite amazed by the workings of a simple insrtument like guitar. The creation of different sounds from slight variations in the way of handling the strings. The importance of silence and emergence of patterns.</p>\n\n<hr />\n<p class=\"mentions-texteditor__content\">What would all these enlightened people do when and if they live together without followers?</p>\n\n<p class=\"mentions-texteditor__content\">Probably they would act normal. Probably that&#39;s why they like to live in isolation or among followers/disciples.</p>\n\n<hr />\n<p class=\"mentions-texteditor__content\">Nothing will ever be enough, not even the <em>best</em>! Don&#39;t believe me? I&#39;ll give you a &quot;small&quot; proof: What happens when you see a <em>(new)</em> magic trick? See this in two phases: 1. Before intellectualizing on the tactics of the magic, 2. After intellectualizing the tactics of it. Do you feel a wonder? A beautiful experience?</p>\n\n<p class=\"mentions-texteditor__content\">If no, I wonder how you feel anything at all.... If you don&#39;t feel anything, you are good (best maybe, for yourself), and good for others as long as you are not psychopath.</p>\n\n<p class=\"mentions-texteditor__content\">If the answer is yes, then think about this: The biggest possible magic is continuously happening within you and outside you - all the time. Something is coming out of nothing (for more intellectualization notice that <em>&quot;something&quot;</em> and <em>&quot;nothing&quot;</em> here are symbolic). There cannot be any bigger magic than this. But even if you know this, where is all the wonder, where is its effect?</p>\n\n<p class=\"mentions-texteditor__content\">You will always be in search of something no matter where you reach.</p>\n\n<hr />\n<p class=\"mentions-texteditor__content\">The people who say, &quot;Why be concerned about trifle, impermanent things? At last everyone&#39;s gonna be evaporated...&quot; Don&#39;t they know that inspite of this fact, which everyone knows, there&#39;s joy, feelings, emotions etc in these temporary, trifle things, events?</p>\n\n<p class=\"mentions-texteditor__content\">They do. But just as other people can&#39;t help but ignore the larger picture, they can&#39;t help but see the larger picture. It&#39;s just about perception, nothing&nbsp;epistemological.</p>\n\n<hr />\n<p class=\"mentions-texteditor__content\">They say music is composed of sounds and silence.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"mentions-texteditor__content\">It&#39;s funny that when you are facing those sounds and silences, they seem nothing like music. As a matter of fact they are tormenting if anything.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"mentions-texteditor__content\">You can perceive life in the similar vein, and universe as well.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"mentions-texteditor__content\">But&nbsp;then, what&#39;s the point if I&nbsp;can&#39;t listen to the music, all I hear is noises.</p>\n\n<hr />\n<p class=\"mentions-texteditor__content\">There are all kinds of people. Any idea and there will be a group of people which will like it. Successful people happen to find their audience.</p>\n\n<hr />\n<p class=\"mentions-texteditor__content\">AI is not imparting (to machines) or genertaing intelligence. AI is encoding perceptible aspects of intelligence.</p>\n\n<hr />\n<p class=\"mentions-texteditor__content\">Look at something at your computer screen, fixated at the small part of the screen. Expand your vision towards bigger part of the screen, the whole screen, slightly around outside the screen, expand slightly more, including more surrounding, expand even more covering the&nbsp;whole horizon perceivable by eyes, including everything. Listen to some sound, expand to other sounds, include everything hearable. Close your eyes, include whats imaginable, expanding, include everything imaginable, include what&#39;s unimaginable, include everything. Go to nothing.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"mentions-texteditor__content\">Come back to the centre of attention.</p>\n\n<p class=\"mentions-texteditor__content\">It&#39;s hard to do this. Don&#39;t make a pattern out of it. It just becomes another object of perception and experience.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"mentions-texteditor__content\">Sometimes non-concept itself becomes a concept. &quot;Nothing&quot; can easily become a thing itself.</p>\n\n<hr />\n<p class=\"mentions-texteditor__content\">Is it that intelligent but somewhat depressed people believe in the wholeness of the universe, consciousness etc? An example is David Bohm. No, there have been many examples from India, who by no means can be said to be depressed, they had firm belief in &#39;oneness&#39;.</p>\n\n<hr />\n<p class=\"mentions-texteditor__content\">Development of anything is not single-faceted. It&#39;s like evolution. Take for example, religion; those who wanted to understand the world invented the concept of God, those who wanted to withdraw themselves in seeking God, inner peace etc invented rituals. Those who wanted social revolution/control invented precepts, commandments. Those who wanted to rule used it as power.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"mentions-texteditor__content\">Take feminism for example. It born out of someone&#39;s understanding of women&#39;s suffering and then took the course of power to&nbsp;evolve.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<hr />\n<p class=\"mentions-texteditor__content\">Look at money, how it has become unreal to so real that we cannot imagine otherwise. It doesn&#39;t have any existence, but is so pervasive.</p>\n\n<p class=\"mentions-texteditor__content\">In a world where Economic Growth and the Money Machine is of the utmost importance, and where people cannot imagine an action without the forces of Lust, Anger, Greed, Attachment, Ego and where the outcomes are much more significant than the good will, so much so that the other seems meaningless, why am I concerned with the fundamentals of thoughts and actions?</p>\n\n<p class=\"mentions-texteditor__content\">&nbsp;</p>\n\n<hr />\n<p class=\"mentions-texteditor__content\">In Upanishads, something like this is mentioned:</p>\n\n<p class=\"mentions-texteditor__content\">There are five conditions for words to reveal any knowledge. Brahman, however, does not fulfill any of them. How can Brahman be revealed by studying scriptures or words or via shabda Pramanam?<br />\nThe five conditions for words are:<br />\n&nbsp; 1. Rudhihi or Pratyaksha Vishayatvam: means it is available for direct perception. You can see an object. Then we can name the object. Let us call the object a &ldquo;Clip&rdquo;. In future the word Clip reveals the object in mind.<br />\n&nbsp; 2. Jathihi: Means species. Consider a tree outside that you have not experienced. You have experienced some other tree(s). You understand tree without experiencing the tree outside. You are able to do so because this tree also belonged to the same class of tree. You, thus, understand the meaning of the word &ldquo;tree&rdquo; as object falling under a species.<br />\n&nbsp; 3. Guna: Properties of the object also help identify it.<br />\n&nbsp; 4. Karma: When someone says, call the driver; the word driver reveals him through his function.<br />\n&nbsp; 5. Sambandha: Relationship is another way of revealing. Thus father, brother, sister etc., reveal relationships.<br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"mentions-texteditor__content\">What I found interesting is that in Wittgenstein&#39;s Philosophical Investigations, he presented almost the same things with detailed analysis.</p>\n\n<hr />\n<p class=\"mentions-texteditor__content\">The ways of looking at things completely changes the meaning.</p>\n\n<p class=\"mentions-texteditor__content\">An example from life or Mirza Ghalib:</p>\n\n<p class=\"mentions-texteditor__content\">Ghalib was once sitting with his friends when they saw that a donkey came, sniffed a mango which had been lying on the ground and without eating went away. One of his friends retorted, &ldquo;<em>Gadhe bhi aam nhi khate (even donkeys don&rsquo;t eat mangoes)</em>,&rdquo; making Ghalib retort in his witty and humorous style that &ldquo;<em>Sirf gadhe hi aam nahi khate (only donkeys don&rsquo;t eat mangoes).&rdquo;&nbsp;</em></p>\n\n<hr />\n<p class=\"mentions-texteditor__content\">Sometimes even the creator of the fundamental doesn&#39;t know what it means.</p>\n\n<p class=\"mentions-texteditor__content\">Example:</p>\n\n<p class=\"mentions-texteditor__content\">Schrodinger wrote the fundamental equation of Quantum Mechanics, but when asked about what that means, what it represents, he replied, &quot;I don&#39;t know&quot;.</p>\n\n<hr />\n<p class=\"mentions-texteditor__content\">There are two principle components of money: trust and lust/greed. They have similar nature as of horses described in Plato&#39;s symposium.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<hr />\n<p class=\"mentions-texteditor__content\">What is the best way to fix all the world problems? - Education.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"mentions-texteditor__content\">How to educate?&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"mentions-texteditor__content\">There must be some basic substructure of intelligence, need to find how to identify that and apply that to contextual methods and tools and situations as per the audience.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<hr />\n<p class=\"mentions-texteditor__content\">The art of living..</p>\n\n<p class=\"mentions-texteditor__content\">What is art? When you play an instrument, how does it happen? You practice indefinitely, then it becomes your first nature, and then the thought, the analysis does not occur as you play the instrument.</p>\n\n<p class=\"mentions-texteditor__content\">Similarly in case of living, which is based on observation, if you perceive without thought, analysis, you will get the same kind of output as you get from the art.</p>\n\n<hr />\n<p class=\"mentions-texteditor__content\"><span><span class=\"ember-view\" id=\"ember2056\"><span>&quot;If you are depressed you are living in the past. If you are anxious you are living in the future. If you are at peace you are living in the present.&quot;</span></span></span></p>\n\n<p class=\"mentions-texteditor__content\"><span class=\"ember-view\" id=\"ember2129\"><span>Isn&#39;t it that if you are living in past, you can be depressed if the past had bad events? Isn&#39;t it that if you live in past you can still be depressed if the past contained good events but the present doesn&#39;t and isn&#39;t going to, as far as you can see? Isn&#39;t it that if you are (absorbed) living in past which had great experience, but you don&#39;t try to transpose that great experience to present (forming an expectation), you would draw happiness from that? und so weiter und so fort</span></span></p>\n\n<hr />\n<p class=\"mentions-texteditor__content\">If thinking from first principle is not attainable for you try to &quot;think back to the first principles&quot;.</p>\n\n<hr />\n<p class=\"mentions-texteditor__content\">Suppose you are in a place where everyone is equal to you in all the perceived ways, like in terms of money, prestige, intelligence etc.. You don&#39;t see servants, or anyone who is inferior in any way. You all are rich, how would you feel? How would you feel in the long run, imagine an entire lifetime?</p>\n\n<p class=\"mentions-texteditor__content\">What does it tell about human nature?</p>\n\n<p class=\"mentions-texteditor__content\">There&#39;s no harmony without both of the higher and lower (pitches of) notes.</p>\n\n<p class=\"mentions-texteditor__content\">... that harmony is composed of differing notes of higher or lower pitch which disagreed once, but are now reconciled by the art of music; for if the higher and lower notes still disagreed, there could be no harmony,&mdash;clearly not. For harmony is a symphony, and symphony is an agreement; but an agreement of disagreements while they disagree there cannot be; you cannot harmonize that which disagrees. In like manner rhythm is compounded of elements short and long, once differing and now in accord; which accordance, as in the former instance, medicine, so in all these other cases, music implants, making love and unison to grow up among them; and thus music, too, is concerned with the principles of love in their application to harmony and rhythm. - <em>Symposium, Plato</em></p>\n\n<hr />\n<p class=\"mentions-texteditor__content\">When does the thought become practice, when does the practice become second nature, when does the second nature becomes just nature. What is nature if not custom?</p>\n\n<p class=\"mentions-texteditor__content\">What is the dynamics of award in shaping the second nature? E.g. if I teach Java or Python to someone as the first programming language they ever encounter, it is quite possible that they would not bother to bear the pain associated with C, even though they can clearly see the advantage of C over Java. On the other hand, if I teach C or Assembly first, they will be overwhelmed by the cumbersome structure of C, and might develop an aversion towards it.</p>\n\n<p class=\"mentions-texteditor__content\">In another example, while learning guitar, if I just perfect my basics but do not produce any soothing sound to reward myself, I might lose patience. But if I reward myself with just some sootihing sounds, but do not perfect the basics first, it will stick with me.</p>\n\n<p class=\"mentions-texteditor__content\">How much consciousness should be involved while practicing. If I pay attention towards the steps always, I&#39;ll never be able to convert it to the second nature, but I do not pay any attention, then I won&#39;t be able to develop anything at all.</p>\n\n<hr />\n<p class=\"mentions-texteditor__content\">My general disposition is like of Henry David Thorough like anti-developmentalist etc but when I inquire why and why I find that actually I&#39;m just anti-existence. All other reasons are just narrow minded.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"mentions-texteditor__content\">What do i keep complaining about? Is it because I can&#39;t deal with the complexity? Forced evolution and metamorphosis is painful. You force an insect into metamorphosis saying that it will become beautiful, but maybe it doesnt. And beautiful in what way?&nbsp;</p>\n\n<hr />\n<p class=\"mentions-texteditor__content\">My mind continuously wanders between domains of generalization and specialization. It is a not uncommon pattern in the world out there as well.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<hr />\n<p class=\"mentions-texteditor__content\">Capitalism has produced many good things railways, medicine, etc...</p>\n\n<p class=\"mentions-texteditor__content\">But it has also created and keeps on creating new needs. And Marx thought that this system would not be able to catch up with the needs produced by it. E.g. nobody would mind the hiss in music players before CD&#39;s came, but now we need the music to be hiss-less. Another example is Hula Hoops.&nbsp;&nbsp; - Rick Roderick</p>\n\n<p class=\"mentions-texteditor__content\">If you want to know how someone thinks look at how they dress, who they hang out with, where they live, the kinds of folks they went school with.</p>\n\n<p class=\"mentions-texteditor__content\">You can&#39;t have a person&#39;s life reduced to total poverty,&nbsp;penury and say that he has a free life.</p>\n\n<p class=\"mentions-texteditor__content\">Similarly, you can&#39;t have have your life reduced to work, no matter how high the wage and say that it is an excellent life.&nbsp; - Rick Roderick</p>\n\n<p class=\"mentions-texteditor__content\">In capitalist society if a woman is&nbsp; asked what do you do and the reply is &quot;I&#39;m a home-worker&quot; it creates weird scenario, because home-making is not a waged act. It&#39;s not what you do.</p>\n\n<p class=\"mentions-texteditor__content\">To follow the moral models and have a good life, the first requirement is to have necessary human conditions e.g Food, Shelter, ordinary Healthcare. Also, to have a life not reduced to work is also a necessary condition to be free and have a good life.</p>\n\n<p class=\"mentions-texteditor__content\">2+2=4, A is A, .. they are all acceptable precisely because nothing of great importance to human values hangs on truths that everyone accepts. - Rick Roderick</p>\n\n<p class=\"mentions-texteditor__content\">Systems of power and systems of value tend to become total, that is they strive to capture total field. This is true of religion, this is true of idiological politics. - Rick Roderick</p>\n\n<p class=\"mentions-texteditor__content\">Slaves have power too, but they have been constrained from exercising them. What constraints? Of different forms at different times and different places.</p>\n\n<hr />\n<p class=\"mentions-texteditor__content\">How do we know truth, false, good, bad?</p>\n\n<hr />\n<p class=\"mentions-texteditor__content\">How do you write a book? You make a choice of interpretation, and find anecdotes, arguments, aphorisms, stories etc that support the choice and then take this choice in detail and link with everything else.</p>\n\n<hr />\n<p class=\"mentions-texteditor__content\">There&#39;s a pattern showing up, everything is growing incompelxity, what happens to those who do not adjust to complexity, they get lost in the wild.</p>\n\n<hr />\n<p class=\"mentions-texteditor__content\">There are no facts, but interpretations - Nitzsche. Why? Because just like for every argument there can be critic or counter-argument, for every fact there will be multiple interpretations.</p>\n\n<hr />\n<p class=\"mentions-texteditor__content\">Have you noticed that many times it&#39;s not that we choose a particular kind of solution (when many solutions exists for the problem), rather some particular type of the solution emerges by the way we work and look at things and focus on elements?</p>\n\n<p class=\"mentions-texteditor__content\">Similar thing happened to the East and the West when focussing on big questions of life. West developed solutions like materialistic, distractions, top-down approaches. East developed solutions like spiritual, discipline, bottom-up solutions.</p>\n\n<p class=\"mentions-texteditor__content\">What&#39;s interesting is West is able to influence East so much..</p>\n\n<hr />\n<p class=\"mentions-texteditor__content\">\u0926\u0930\u094d\u0926 \u0939\u0948 \u091a\u0932\u093e \u091c\u093e\u090f\u0917\u093e<br />\n\u0926\u0935\u093e \u0939\u0948 \u0915\u093e\u092e \u0906\u090f\u0917\u0940<br />\n\u0926\u0941\u0906 \u0939\u0948 \u0915\u093e\u092e \u0906\u090f\u0917\u0940<br />\n\u092a\u0930 \u0926\u0930\u094d\u0926 \u092b\u093f\u0930 \u0935\u0947\u0936 \u092c\u0926\u0932 \u0915\u0930 \u0906\u090f\u0917\u093e<br />\n\u0926\u0930\u094d\u0926 \u0939\u0948? \u091a\u0932\u093e \u091c\u093e\u090f\u0917\u093e!<br />\n...&nbsp;</p>\n\n<hr />\n<p class=\"mentions-texteditor__content\">Isn&#39;t holding of virtues a rebellion against evolutionary processes?</p>\n\n<hr />\n<p class=\"mentions-texteditor__content\">Science and religion cannot co-exist?&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"mentions-texteditor__content\">What is religion? What is science?&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"mentions-texteditor__content\">Religion is about relationships: within you, within social group, outside social group, and something covers everything.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"mentions-texteditor__content\">Now science also deals with things which were considered not to be in reach of science.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<hr />\n<p class=\"mentions-texteditor__content\">The most profound thing that I&#39;ve discovered about life is that sometimes dreams are as lively, sometimes thoughts themselves are as lively as &quot;real&quot; life experience. Sometimes I can be satisfied by someone else&#39;s experience as much as like it&#39;s my own. But the truth is that everything is impermanent. Other times I feel jealousy as well.</p>\n\n<hr />\n<p class=\"mentions-texteditor__content\">You know sometimes while driving on the highway one or two cars pass by (take over), my first intuitive reaction is to gear up and sometimes I do, but other times I think &quot;why&quot;, &quot;why am I rushing/hurrying, I don&#39;t know about their situation, maybe they need to hurry, or maybe it is normal for them, or maybe they don&#39;t care about it and just flow in high speed, but why am I hurrying when I don&#39;t feel that need?&quot;. Unfortunately, I do it in life as well.</p>\n\n<hr />\n<p class=\"mentions-texteditor__content\">Is it possible that we do actually love the ideas/concepts and then try to embody those into people. It could be your partner, some guru, god. Platonists, Sufists, Mystics rather focus on the forms themselves and realize that embodiments are pretentious.

The gap b/w these jumps from one novel thing to another is what gives feeling of existential crisis, and if you are lucky enough you won&#39;t realize the gaps as you quickly jump from one thing to another conforming the experiences of others or even your own. If you are lucky enough you have so many novel experiences that these gaps lose any significance, and you spend your whole life without being affected by it. There is no absolute for how novel something should be to make you happy, content, excited..it&#39;s all relative.</p>\n\n<p class=\"mentions-texteditor__content\">What if God is the projection of collective psychic body especially the positive aspects of it?</p>\n\n<hr />\n<p class=\"mentions-texteditor__content\">I think anything that can be defined <strong>exactly</strong>, is not natural.</p>\n\n<hr />\n<p dir=\"ltr\">A stupid thought:-</p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">What if our perceived world is a simulation?</p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Why would anyone run such a costly (in terms of resource consumption) simulation??</p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Here&#39;s a possibility:<br />\nLet&#39;s say in an alternate universe which has true democracy, at one point of time majority says: &quot;we have such and such idea... Why don&#39;t we implement it?&quot; Their idea is similar to our economic system (basically valuating everything with something like money and the rest of the game).</p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The thinkers of their universe mull over that idea and see certain flaws in it. But being a true democracy, they need to show the flaws to their people.<br />\nSo, they run a simulation by incepting some traits/passions in organisms to show what happens if that particular idea is implemented..</p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Seeing that we are unable to implement any other system (or even do away with it altogether) than our current economic system and an interesting thing that economic growth itself seems to be of supreme importance, everything else being secondary/side-effects (including alleviation of extreme poverty, otherwise I believe, I could be wrong though, that we already have enough resources and awareness to be able to solve such issues)... it makes sense.</p>\n\n<hr />\n<p class=\"mentions-texteditor__content\">You think the world is getting better?</p>\n\n<p class=\"mentions-texteditor__content\">Yes it is, but who is making it so? The players of money. Do you think intention matters or just the result at hand matters? Either way you should ask &quot;What is their intention?

A, B, C are main our main characters. A hated C, he decided to murder C by putting poison in the water bottle of C. Quite independently of this, B also decided to murder C, so (without realizing that B has already poisoned the water) he drilled a tiny hole in C&#39;s bottle. Several days later C died of thirst.

You see only the nutcases doing so, meybe they have lost their mind, their mind has been conditioned. You don&#39;t see adults doing childlike things. Why should they, they have learned things, their tricks and manners. They have responsibilities. Towards their families, the society, they are trying to make the world a better place, they don&#39;t have time to be childlike. It hurts to be a child and do childlike things, unless they are drunk. They know what is life, and they know exactly when to live it.</p>\n\n<p class=\"mentions-texteditor__content\">It is not very painful to see the blood gushing out of you. What hurts even more is the blood dripping drop by drop, slowly, peacefully as you watch it. After each drip or so you think it will be okay, that it does not matter. And it goes on till you become pale and there is nothing left. It doesn&#39;t hurt as much to get it, enjoy it and then lose it, much as you cherish it in your lucid dreams, see life in it, hope for it and then watch the only existence of it which is the hope itself fade away.</p>\n\n<hr />\n<p class=\"mentions-texteditor__content\">I woud love to agree to the people most of the time, I would love to accept the conventional ideas of beauty, knowledge, wisdom, good, bad and all those. I would even love to agree with the notion of being different and being radical, thinking out of the box. But the fact is that I simply can&#39;t. I see all the flaws, in me, in others, in the notion of beauty, in the notion of goodwill, in the process of thinking about the flaws itself, I see the flaw in the flaw itself. The only sympathy I find for this cynical thought process is in the literature, I see that some faced this same dillemma in the past.

And what&#39;s more absurd is the delusions that people live in. Just think about it: sentient beings are thrown into this world to fight a battle against the environment. What drives them? The desire to live, to continue living, the life itself. Basically every being has the same fundamental driving force. But in the process of fighting with environment they form so many delusions, and how they rejoice in those delusions like pride, aesthetics, superiority, classes,... The absurd is that they forget the basics as soon as they get comfortable with survival against environment. The ignorance that is shown by people, the ignorance of an understanding, a unique capability of humans to even think about this whole existence is absurd. The driving force for life is the desire to live, and once all the hindrances in the surival are taken care of, there seems to be no life. We seek something else. Then something new is desired, a new form of life. This continuous chase for&nbsp;life is absurd.

That they achieved something, accomplished something? If you do something, and it turns out to be well, it&#39;s not that you did well. You just did something, as per your capabilities, and the result turned out to be what it did. And if you are proud of the fact that you did your best, then the outcome doesn&#39;t matter anyway. I must assume that those who are proud in the second way, are respectable, humble and huamanistic. Those who are proud in the first way are beasts.</p>\n\n<p>See it like this, for a seed to grow into a plant or a tree many things are required - seed itself, sunlight, soil, minerals, water, shade etc..

How many humans are seen engaging in creative work?]</em></p>\n\n<p>Anarcho-Syndicalism : A federated, decentralized system of free association incorporating social as well as economic institutions. suppression, oppression, coercion, destruction which exist now only as historical residue will be eliminated. It is an appropriate form of social organization for an advanced technological society.</p>\n\n<p>Foucault:</p>\n\n<p>People know only about direct exertion of political power by govt e.g. police, army; there are other indirect institutions (which seem neutral and independent) which are used e.g. universities (education system in general), psychiatry, justice which exclude instruments of power of certain social class. We first need to criticize this mode of working, then move to formula future of society, otherwise these forms would reproduce themselves even in ideal organizations like Anarcho-Syndicalism.</p>\n\n<p>Chomsky: agree... also financial institutions e.g. MNCs appear to be neutral but are form of oppression, coercion. This is definitely a task of intellectual community. But also, we can&#39;t throw the abstract concepts of a just society should be, we should know what it would look like in future (even if we don&#39;t know the details).</p>\n\n<p>Foucault: Isn&#39;t there a danger there? These human natures you are talking about which have not been realized so far and so on, don&#39;t we risk defining this human nature in terms borrowed from out society, our culture, civilization? E.g. Marxism asserted that human nature was alienated in a capitalist system, and Marxism ultimately dreamed of a liberated human nature. On the other hand what model did Marxism use to conceive, project and eventually realize that human nature? It was in fact, the Bourgeois model. And this happened in Soviet Union. A utopic and real kind of society had been reconstituted. Look what happened. It&#39;s difficult to conceive what human nature is.</p>\n\n<p>Chomsky: Acknowledge that. But just like in political situations it seems urgency to take some action even if there is danger in taking it like in case of Civial Disobedience (an action undertaken under lot of uncertainities about its effect like it threatens the social order in ways which might bring on Fascism) but at the same time there was great danger in not undertaking an action (society of Indo-China will be shred under the power of America). Similarly in intellectual domain even though there are uncertainities, we need to take some action.</p>\n\n<p>Foucault:</p>\n\n<p>The notion of Justice itself functions within a society of classes as a claim made by and as a justification for the class which is oppressed. In a classless society, I&#39;m not sure we would still be using this notion of justice.</p>\n\n<p>Chomsky: Disagree. There is some sort of absolute basis ultimately residing in fundamental human qualities in terms of which our real notion of justice is grounded. Even though our existing systems of justice embody systems of class oppression, and other kinds of oppression, it&#39;s too hasty to characterize them as mere justification of oppression.</p>\n\n<p>My main takeaway from this talk: Philosophers (try to) see something that is not obvious (although it could be just a figment of mind?).</p>\n\n<hr />\n<p>We are buying more and more time using technology. But do we know what to do with that time?

With high quality AR/VR everything far will be realistic enough.</li>\n\t<li>Absorb yourself?<br />\n\t&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - Absorb into pursuit of some goal, work? But with more and more advancement, you will have less and less goals and work. There will be service providers for everything.<br />\n\t&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - Absorb into art, sciences? The scope of sciences is going to be minimal at some point. Art? Not sure. But you know how hard it is now to see originality in art. <em>(Same stuff, different packaging. AI is going to make it even more banal.)</em><br />\n\t&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - Absorb into pleasure? - Try it!!</li>\n\t<li>Distract yourself? - Use drugs to enter a different realm, or paint the reality with different colors.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Imagine you are able to (<em>with the help of technology</em>) listen to other people&#39;s thoughts without talking, without listening. All social games minimalised. Transmission of thoughts would also become digital??</p>\n\n<hr />\n<p>So, this is how we are trying to solve problems of humanity.</p>\n\n<p>More and more globalization, urbanization. This has proved to remove poverty. We are looking for/waiting for cheap energy resources. <em>Like we don&#39;t already have resources to eliminate poverty. Nobody is talking (at least in mainstream) that elimination of poverty is not the goal, it&#39;s just a side-effect. Making the world a better place is not a goal, but a side-effect while some people are fullfilling their passions.</em></p>\n\n<p>We don&#39;t want to be judged by people. We fail to make friends, We fail to make bonds. So, we are going to provide you with artificial intelligent friends/assistants. <em>(We don&#39;t want to change our nature of judging, we don&#39;t want to make ourselves capable of respecting everyone, forming bonds)</em></p>\n\n<p>We want AI to be able to be in war-fields. <em>(We are not capable of ending wars themselves, we don&#39;t want to solve the problem of war, hatred.

But it seems to me that we have developed a habit of pushing away the problems rather than solving them. And who is actually doing this? It&#39;s very clear. The people who are passionate for money, fame, power, knowledge&nbsp; etc.. ( or even just meaning in life). The users are just innocent people, consumers.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<hr />\n<p>What&#39;s the difference between a child and an adult? Let me give you an example: During Hitler&#39;s time of rise, those who thought that Hitler is all about peace in Germany, progress in Germany were child. Those who could <strong><em>see through</em></strong> him to figure out that he was determined to go to war, and he cared little about people were adults.</p>\n\n<p>Hitler once said that he had changed, he doesn&#39;t want war even if his book Mein Kamf suggested so. He said that he wrote it from jail in anger. Those who believed him, were innocent. And innocence is what?

But the problem is that I don&#39;t know what&#39;s better? Happiness? The things that people find happiness in, is absurd. And this is what (most) people have been doing actully, finding happiness. Then the current state of the world is good as is. And what is the final state of this world, a technological utopia?? I doubt that.</p>\n\n<hr />\n<p>To get real clarity, first you need to be awefully confused.</p>\n\n<hr />\n<p>I think it&#39;s very naive of us to label philosophers of the past according to the terms we have created. Looking at the works of theirs it does not seem correct to label them. Was Augustine a libertarian, or a Compatibilist?</p>\n\n<hr />\n<p>The question is Why superstition over knowledge, why blind faith over inquiry?</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>The possibility of really understanding the world and life and the universe is such an immensly exciting one that to be fobbed off with a cheap falsehood, a supernatural explanation that really doesn&#39;t explain anything; maybe it&#39;s harmless, maybe it gives you solace but I think it actually is mentally degrading in that it teaches you to be satisfied with a non-explanation when a real explanation is within our grasp - <a href=\"https://youtu.be/47pPkePJ0do?t=1312\" target=\"_blank\">Richard Dawkins</a>.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>&nbsp;<em>[Try giving explanation to someone who is looking for meaning of life.]</em></p>\n\n<p>The question is if God exists, then why doesn&#39;t he show up.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp; - It&#39;s not that simple. If God shows up and you see, and not everybody else sees. How to be sure that what shows up is not an imagination? And how to be sure that it is not real? OTOH, if God shows up to everybody, He is just another object that is seen.</p>\n\n<p>God is an invention. What&#39;s the benefit of this invention? - See Pascal&#39;s quote to get a hint.&nbsp; &quot;We never seek things for themselves, but for the search. Likewise in plays, scenes which do not rouse emotion of fear are worthless, so are extreme and hopeless misery, brutal lust, and extreme cruelty. So is with search of truth.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>And if God doesn&#39;t exist, then why the concept?</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;- this has been attributed to imagination. But the question is why other things imagined did not survive? E.g. unicorn (an amazing inagination) why don&#39;t we have people believe in it? And more importantly, why don&#39;t people care much about whether it exists or not? One answer could be because the imagination of God was useful and interweaved with life.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>People ask about existence of God, but rarely ask&mdash; with the same conviction &mdash; about existence of existence?</p>\n\n<p>What does existence even mean? What is the underlying mechanism of existence?&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Moreover, they necver question the explanations. Nothing can be explained unless you accept something.</p>\n\n<p>Moreover, they only take into account their usual perceptions. By usual perceptions, you can only see the existence of whole numbers 1, 2, 3,... But, as soon as you start using the intellect, the existence of real numbers becomes clear.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<hr />\n<p>Moral relativists say: why does it have to be objective, eternal meaning/benefit, I can find a transitory reason/purpose e.g. there is someone hurt, I can provide help, that is good enough grounds for morality.</p>\n\n<p>Voltaire said &quot;I know that there is no God but don&#39;t tell that to my servant, lest he&#39;ll kill me while I&#39;m asleep&quot;. Why would the servant do this, because he is damn sure that there is nothing objective, no God to fear, nothing on a grand scale, he just sees that his family will revel in the money he would steal, that&#39;s a good enough purpose to drive his actions. There goes the reasoning based grounds for morality.</p>\n\n<p>If you say that we have law for enforcement in such situations, then why don&#39;t we evaluate the enforcement of &quot;God&quot; vs enforcement of civil law.</p>\n\n<hr />\n<p>From the producers of <a href=\"https://www.amc.com/shows/mad-men/\" target=\"_blank\">MadMen</a>:&nbsp;</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Advertising does not make you want to do anything, It reflects, it reminds you to do what you already want to do. It is a mirror. You like to be thinner, we reminded that you are fat.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Is it so?</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>That&#39;s only one case. It is very well-known how psychological knowledge is exploited in advertisement.</p>\n\n<p>Advertisement by itself is not something that can be said bad. The methods applied in it, the consequences (intentional or unintentional) have to be taken into account, the intentions behind it matter as well. Moreover, it goes into more complex questions &mdash; what is life all about? What is a good life? What is best for humans psyche, considering its modes of operation, its limitations etc? What and how much does a person actually need to be happy, to lead a good life?</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<hr />\n<p>Before giving up:<br />\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;(a) Have I exhausted everything I have and everything I know?<br />\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;(b) Do I not see anything coming?<br />\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;(c) Can I believe myself on not seeing anything coming?<br />\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />\nYou don&#39;t give up, until the universe gives up on you. How do you know that universe has not given up on you?<br />\nOne thing is that you are still breathing, you still occupy space on this earth.<br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n\n<hr />\n<p>Do we really have a choice?</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>Is a child born like a clean slate?</li>\n\t<li>Yes? That means that the child does not have choice making capability, it won&#39;t even understand that it has choices. It won&#39;t even understand that it has the capability to choose.</li>\n\t<li>But when the child becomes adult it has choices, it can decide, in short it can make decision about its destiny and how he perceives the world, what is good, what is bad.</li>\n\t<li>Yes? Then what happened between childhood and adulthood?&nbsp;</li>\n\t<li>The child got learning. From where? - From everywhere including parents, close society etc.</li>\n\t<li>Let&#39;s say a child gets coffee, becomes fond of coffee. Parents see that he is consuming it in excess. Parents tell him that coffee is not good for health, it can affect hairs (causes hairfall). So the child stops drinking coffee in excessive quanity. In fact, he can be frightened about hairfall and not drink it at all.</li>\n\t<li>Another child, same problem, but nobody told him this piece of information. So he drinks on excessive amount of coffee.</li>\n\t<li>So, the choices these children make is dependent on what? - Environmental inputs.</li>\n\t<li>Another child, same problem, he is told the problem with coffee... But he doesn&#39;t really care about it. And fortunately nothing wrong happens to him due to excessive coffee.. In fact he finds that it boosts energy a bit. So he drinks on. So, what happened here? - The child made a choice.&nbsp;</li>\n\t<li>But we established that child cannot make choices, without environmental learning. Was it a conscious choice, like we adults make? Or, was it a random choice? Is a random choice indeed a choice? Wouldn&#39;t you call it fate?</li>\n\t<li>Now, if a child is born a clean slate. How come this child acted differently in this case. &quot;He didn&#39;t seem to care about it&quot; - why? what&#39;s different here? He was given same information in same way.&nbsp;</li>\n\t<li>Maybe his brain works in a different way. Maybe something is different in his underlying cognitive structure. Of course everyone is different, however we fall in categories.</li>\n\t<li>But you see, the child who didn&#39;t care and ignored parent&#39;s advice. And fortunately he didn&#39;t get any side effects from coffee (just because his body was capable of handling it), he might learn to avoid parent&#39;s advice. And in process as he goes on with his life, he ignores many of his parent&#39;s advice which are improtant. So, what happened here? - His perception of the world changed, his decision making process changed. What&#39;s good and what&#39;s bad changed. And all because of (interaction of nature and nurture). You know that small events can produce&nbsp;significant impacts?</li>\n\t<li>So effectively, when you say &quot;I made this choice or he made this choice for himself&quot;, I understand that it was his body, it was his mind, but when we can clearly see that it all resulted from a sequence of events, I don&#39;t see where was he in all this journey. This I/he/she you are talking about, is a result of numerous random choices, numerous things inside your body and brain, you don&#39;t even know (remember) where you got some ideas from.</li>\n\t<li>&nbsp;</li>\n\t<li>Now, let&#39;s talk about current state. What&#39;s done is done. Now you think that whatever it was, however it happened, you feel that now you can make choices for yourselves.</li>\n\t<li>Suppose you are a girl, you have a lot of options who show that they love you. (Some of the options&nbsp;may be hidden, you don&#39;t even know about them, because they couldn&#39;t show their love. Why couldn&#39;t they show? It&#39;s their choice? whatever...Let&#39;s forget about them for now). Do you really have a choice whom do you like, whom do you love. Not evaluate for marriage. Whom you ACTUALLY LOVE, you think you have a choice?</li>\n\t<li>Suppose these scenarios where girls choose boys. In some cases, the choice turned out to be bad, and their condition worsens. It&#39;s easy to say that it was their choice that brought them into this mess. But was it? Was love their choice? You could say that they could catch the red flags. But really? First thing not everybody is expert in catching red flags (why? - again nature and nurture), and second thing even if they caught red flags, it was love, was love their choice?</li>\n\t<li>Now you can say, okay things got messed up, now it&#39;s their choice how to proceed. But some of them had never happened to put a fight, struggle. They don&#39;t even know that they can get out of this mess easily. But you say, they have examples, we have so many examples, they did come out of mess.&nbsp;</li>\n\t<li>Remember that tea and coffe guy, where child couldn&#39;t practise parent&#39;s advice. Maybe this girl never practiced any positive advice. How can she suddenly make her mind, &quot;No! I can do this. It&#39;s a mess, I can get out of it.&quot; You know, the same motivational speech works on some people and is completely useless on others. Similarly with drugs, drugs affect some people and are useless on others.</li>\n\t<li>Also, it&#39;s very common to observe that same situation and people react differently, same wound, someone cries, someone doesn&#39;t, same temperature, someone feels more cold, someone less, we don&#39;t even see the same redness, if we are looking at a red thing. Clearly, our brain processes information differently, and if processing is different outcomes can be different too, if outcomes are different, behavior, habit can be different. If perception, habit, behavior is different choices can be different too.&nbsp;</li>\n\t<li>WHEN DO WE ACTUALLY MAKE A CHOICE? ACTUALLY WHERE IS THE ONE WHO MAKES CHOICE HERE? IT ALL SEEMS TO BE JUST REACTION, FORMING A PATTERN, SOMETIMES BREAKING A PATTERN.</li>\n\t<li>It wouldnt&#39; have taken this long to illustrate the point if we just consider that we act as our brain suggests, and our brain suggests after doing calculations, and calculations happen on input parameters, but input paramters themselves are result of computations, so it all goes back to seed parameters. Also, consider that in a multivariable system/equation, to simplify you can assume some variables to be constant, but the fact is that each variable can have a significant impact. Also, even if the input parameters, and computational instructions are same, the execution and output depends upon hardware.</li>\n\t<li>The quality/quantity of fruits that a tree gives, depends on how was the tree nurtured <em>(did it get proper manure, sunlight, shade, air etc when required)</em> and it also depends on the quality of the seed.</li>\n\t<li>Is happiness a choice?&nbsp; Is behavior a choice? Does behavior, habit play a role in choice? Does knowledge, mood, intuition, experience play a role in making choice?</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>What&#39;s the point here?</p>\n\n<p>The point is that in this random universe, dots can only be connected backwards. We don&#39;t really have choices. I can&#39;t blam anyone for behaving in the way they are, commiting actions that they commit. People need to be humble about themselves as well others.</p>\n\n<p>You can&#39;t blame the tree, you can&#39;t blame the person. There is no tree, there is no person. It&#39;s just an illusionary result of interactions among numerous things.</p>\n\n<hr />\n<p>In the lecture video, objectivism was rejected because statements like &quot;polygamy is bad/dubious&quot; do not hold true or false value universally, they depend on societies/groups.</p>\n\n<p>But take the other example which was ignored, that &quot;Genocide is wrong&quot;. Objectivism means that something will hold true, no matter who/what observed it (i.e. even if there were no humans, and a machine figures it out, it will be the same result), also that its truthiness will be universal.</p>\n\n<p>So let&#39;s generalize &quot;genocide&quot;: in terms of humans, it is killing of a mass of humans. Suppose there&#39;s a system, which has let&#39;s say particles in it, and they are flowing in a certain way (let&#39;s call this state &#39;natural&#39; state). Now, some force comes and destroys (/moves abruptly) a mass of particles. This event (which we happen to call &#39;killing&#39;) will leave the system in an unstable, &#39;unnatural&#39; state. We happen to call this state (or transition) &#39;wrong&#39;. So it&#39;s an objective (both empirically testable and universal) fact.</p>\n\n<p>So the claim that &quot;genocide is wrong&quot; is an objective fact. The statement that &quot;genocide is&nbsp;<em>morally</em>&nbsp;wrong&quot; will remain objective whatever you mean by &quot;morally&quot;, because other elements constitute a statement that is objectively true.</p>\n\n<p>The only common thing/concept between statements like &quot;Genocide is morally wrong&quot; and the statements like &quot;Polygamy is morally wrong&quot;, is the label (&quot;morally&quot;) that we have attached.</p>\n\n<p>So maybe the concept of morality itself is not objective, but some statements regarding morality are objective.</p>\n\n<hr />\n<p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wEdlDqKT8JQ\" target=\"_blank\">When you are with the right audience your words, even presentation doesn&#39;t matter</a> .

What is life? The story of a centipede.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<hr />\n<p>I&#39;m pretty sure, if we remove all our prejudices and biases, identities, and fears; we would feel the same amount of pain when a random person (or even animal) gets hurt as we feel when our loved one gets hurt (same goes for pleasure). It is clear, because there is no physical connection between you and your loved one, and yet because of the mental constructions normally you would feel a pain internally when your loved one gets hurt.</p>\n\n<p>We feel life from a limited set of faculties with limited resources, and yet we know the experience we have forgotten is as much of an experience as we are getting now,...<br />\nAlso, all the experience we get is inside our own mind and body only, yet we need triggers to get access to these experiences, and we need triggers constantly, regularly...</p>\n\n<hr />\n<p>Sometimes it&#39;s not just about the result, it&#39;s more about the process itself. For example, even if you have never caused a car accident, how you drive really matters to those who are sitting in your car.</p>\n\n<hr />\n<p>On one hand people say, why do we have to make sex a taboo, well maybe we shouldn&#39;t .. and now it&#39;s not, but on the other hand, when someone uses sexual remark/joke to make his/her point, it gets extra attention, so basically now it&#39;s&nbsp; eulogized,.... Maybe that&#39;s why, because you couldn&#39;t handle it as it is. Now sex is driving force for everything along with money.</p>\n\n<p>- Because it shows some sign of courage.</p>\n\n<p>- But you are using an otherwise natural thing to show some special trait courage?</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp; - And you are using it as an enticement in each sector of life. In the advertisement for almost everything.</p>\n\n<p>- How/why, of all the taboos this one grabbed such a high status?</p>\n\n<hr />\n<p>Each and every situation has these aspects:</p>\n\n<ul type=\"disc\">\n\t<li>What was</li>\n\t<li>What could be</li>\n\t<li>What is</li>\n\t<li>What should be</li>\n\t<li>What is going to be.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>We can only connect the dots backwards, because each choice we make eliminates all the other options available to us at that time.</p>\n\n<hr />\n<p>If there is no soul, what is the difference between love and lust?</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;- Nothing maybe.</p>\n\n<ul type=\"disc\">\n\t<li>The lovers wouldn&#39;t say so, would they?</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>When you foul someone and fall in love with that person, or when you rise someone and fall in love with them,</p>\n\n<p>When you see something in someone that you lack, or when you see something in someone that you have,</p>\n\n<p>An immense pleasure is borne in your mind and heart.</p>\n\n<p>Comes into your life like a bouquet of fresh red roses in an endless dry desert, and heals the shattered pieces inside you.</p>\n\n<hr />\n<p>We don&#39;t even remember all those things we read, learn, and yet they transform us somehow, it is not just the thoughts and memory that they transform, there is something that manifests itself through thoughts, speech, and actions.</p>\n\n<p>Or is it thought that has created an illusion of &quot;something else&quot;, after all this &quot;something else&quot; ceases to exist once the thought mechanism has died?</p>\n\n<hr />\n<p>How does a cattle feel when it gets lost from its pack into a non-natural setup like our societies made out of concrete <em>(a concrete jungle)</em>? Its sound clearly tells me that it is conscious of its relatives, whereabouts and a feeling of getting lost.</p>\n\n<hr />\n<p>Often times I thought, people are happy with the combination of whatever they have (money, fame, work, love, anger, etc). What&#39;s wrong with that?</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;- Well, nothing. It&#39;s all good. Part of the suffering makes life enjoyable. But these people are not the axle which on which the world runs. The dynamics of the world is controlled by those who are possessed by the passions, ideologies (which is easily manifested in politics but not limited to politics). And these innocent happy people&#39;s lives are controlled by the dynamics created by those who are passionate. For example, suppose you were perfectly happy living in a village. But then transformation started. There came some neo-technological people, who don&#39;t care about your village, don&#39;t care about people, don&#39;t care about nature, all they care about is development <em>(and ultimately money), or maybe they care about your village, but their conviction is that development, money, technology is cruicial for your happiness</em>. Now, you being accustomed to a simple life, do not find it very interesting; and you continue with your perfectly balanced life. But other people get involved with it. They get rich. Your child when mingles with the children of others, he sees those children with smartphones. The happiness of a child is affected, and in consequence, your happiness is affected. It is clear that your life is controlled (affected) by those ideological, passionate people.</p>\n\n<hr />\n<p>&quot;Today you&#39;re supposed to apologize to every NAKED SAVAGE anywhere on the globe, because you are more prosperous because you&#39;ve earned your money, you have to feel guilty and apologize for it...&quot; - Ayn Rand</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; A horse does not admire his companions.

No medical problem, just plain obsession and desire for control which created this monster.</p>\n\n<hr />\n<p>There are two types of people in the world - Platonic and Aristotelian.</p>\n\n<p>What do we mean by Platonic? - Socrates recurring impression that &quot;Man does evil only because he does not know what is actually good for him.&quot;, &quot;An un-inquired life is not worth living&quot;, &quot;We should be virtuous, but what is virtue, must be incessantly inquired?&quot;</p>\n\n<p>&quot;That knowledge is eternally possessed by us, we just recollect it in our current life&quot;, &quot;There is a world of Forms, which is actual cause (or cast) of the imperfect things we see in our perceived reality&quot;</p>\n\n<hr />\n<p>I hate the fact that when I pass by a beggar, I am unable to decide whether he/she genuinely needs help or not.

So, are we not moving from a MYSTERIOUS AUTOMATON to PURE AUTOMATON?&quot;</p>\n\n<p><cite>From &lt;<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6tMLAjPVyo\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6tMLAjPVyo</a>&gt; </cite></p>\n\n<hr />\n<p>I despise inequality and seeing the history and present, I am so disappointed that I do not even seek to eliminate it. Because it is so obvious to me, that inequality thrives because of peoples&#39; stupidity. And people can&#39;t even handle equality, they don&#39;t have that mental faculty. And now people are not only stupid, but they also have a sense of vain intelligence. Now there are more and more &quot;intelligent&quot; stupid. Earlier at least people would have accepted their stupidity, something that&#39;s becoming less and less common. This is my rage and pessimism.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<hr />\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>These monks etc tell that life is suffering... etc. But I have seen people who are happy casually. They get bored sometimes, anxious sometimes, sorrowful also sometimes, but they recover, they get happy again, and it&#39;s true that their happiness depends on things or other people, but in most cases, it works. What&#39;s wrong with that, where&#39;s the problem?</p>\n\n<p>As long as, you have capability to recover, it doesn&#39;t really matter. Suffering in part makes happiness possible and life is what, if not a spectrum of happiness, suffering, etc?</p>\n\n<p>So, are <em>(real)</em> monks superhuman, or not-a-human??</p>\n\n<p>These monks etc, they are so generous to everyone, compassanate. Is it because of some realization, or is it because of the lifestyle they lead. If you spend remaining silent, isolated, of course any human or even animal contact will give you joy. However, one thing to notice is that they do not seek this joy. Those real monks...</p>\n\n<hr />\n<p>When you say I am free, what are you free from? - You are obviously not free from Conformity. Then you might say that we need not be free from Conformity, I am a part of a force which itself is free (as demonstrated by social evolution).</p>\n\n<p>Okay, but how free (from nature) is that force? We will have to wait and see.</p>\n\n<hr />\n<p>Everybody is different, and yet everybody is so same that everybody wants happiness, everybody wants praise, acceptance, love etc. You try hard to understand them and find how chaotic this whole system is that no theory can be universal, and yet somehow they have found hacks to gather community, they search for alikes, they mingle with alikes, affirm their beliefs and faiths, they even try to transform others and succeed sometimes in doing so. It&#39;s all so undeterministic, yet so simplistic. It&#39;s all just a flux of energies looked from a high point, and yet it takes such solid shapes that people become willing to live and die for a particular identity.</p>\n\n<hr />\n<p>You know Hypnosis is possible to some extent, so if I hypnotize a person and tell him to open the door. He will open the door. But when I ask him later after he has come out of hypnosis &#39;why did you open the door?&#39;, he will (most likely) reply &quot;because I heard someone knock on the door&quot;. You conclude that it&#39;s not &quot;his&quot; fault. The mind makes stories to justify the actions that come out because of the subconscious. (This has been demonstrated in psychological studies).</p>\n\n<p>But another question is &quot;Who is &#39;he&#39;, if it&#39;s not &#39;his&#39; fault&quot;? If he is not his body if he is not his mind, then who is &#39;he&#39;?</p>\n\n<hr />\n<p>Suppose, Life is a bottomless pit, are you falling or flying? - Depends on &quot;do you fear the bottom(because your reasons tell you that it can&#39;t be bottomless)?&quot;</p>\n\n<hr />\n<p>You see nations are fighting to increase their combat power by more and more and advanced weapons, you can say that&#39;s progress. But if you see as an independent observer, the overall condition has not improved. The relative difference in combat power would not be as much as advancement. Same has happened with happiness. We have advanced in science and technology but I don&#39;t see any improvement in happiness.</p>\n\n<p>Quantification of happiness:</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp; A poor* person receives 100 Rs. And a rich* person receives 1M Rs, how much difference will be there in their happiness?</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp; A pro player defeats another pro player, and a pro player defeats a beginner. And a beginner defeats another beginner.</p>\n\n<p>How much difference in the winner&#39;s happiness level?</p>\n\n<p>Happiness in relation with necessity*.</p>\n\n<hr />\n<p>Let&#39;s put aside the objective truth, let&#39;s just talk about an individual&#39;s truth. Say an atheist&#39;s truth that &quot;God does not exist&quot;, and a theist&#39;s truth that &quot;God exists&quot;. Atheist&#39;s truth should be truth only if he maintains it when experiencing a lot of dilemma (because truth does not change by logic), similarly a theist&#39;s truth will be truth if he maintains it while experiencing a lot of dilemma (I am not talking about a short term dilemma, but a long term in which the individual gets time to ponder over the possibilities). If the individuals do not maintain their truth, it means it was not truth in the first place, but if they maintain that, it is quite possible that it is the truth that they have practised instead of the objective truth (because if they both have opposite truths how can both exist).</p>\n\n<hr />\n<p>Swampman Thought Experiment:</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;Suppose your child dies, but then with all its might science creates a being that is exactly like your child (EXACTLY!). What do you think is it your child?</p>\n\n<p>Now let&#39;s think this again, your child dies and you do not know about it, and someone sends an exact replica of your child to you. You will certainly accept him/her.</p>\n\n<p>What&#39;s the reality of your child? How is the exact replica not real?</p>\n\n<hr />\n<p>Who/what is it that watches your thoughts and the dream?

But then, which one overpowers depends on the amount of practice itself rather than their objective truth-ness.</p>\n\n<p>What about the things that are in reality (whether individual&#39;s or objective) but never discussed?</p>\n\n<hr />\n<p>We now have more information sources, but we now have less authenticity of the information.

And when you see someone whom you consider beautiful, you feel love towards them. There is a clear relationship between beauty and love. So if you happen to see beauty in everything, you end up loving everything. Does anyone really feel like this? - I don&#39;t know, but people claim so. Buddha, Socrates, Krishnamurthi are examples.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<hr />\n<p>The mediocracy of humans is that sometimes one example is enough to create negative thought and doubts in their minds and one example is enough to give them hopes. Trifle things such as pushing a ball into a hole or a false praise is enough to make them happy, and trifle things such as bad word coming from someone&#39;s mouth is enough to make him angry/anxious.</p>\n\n<hr />\n<p>If people can be angry without drugs, why can&#39;t they be blissful without drugs?</p>\n\n<hr />\n<p>Making computers (AI Agents) human-like doesn&#39;t even make sense.. especially when it comes to&nbsp;emotions</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp; Example: Humans have to practice, use props, form habits to make themselves happy (maybe it&#39;s still rewiring of neural circuitry) but AI agents can do the same thing instantaneously. Why would they go through all the fuss to reach the same state?</p>\n\n<p>The only point I see in making them human-like is to fool ourselves that we can CREATE life. But is there life? What is life? - Just mimicking what we have seen, or even imagining new things?</p>\n\n<hr />\n<p>Is a baby born conscious, or he/she becomes conscious at some point in life?</p>\n\n<hr />\n<p>From reading Sophie&#39;s world, the question arises:</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;If a 3d simulation is a candidate for reality i.e. &#39;we are in a simulation&#39;, why can&#39;t the ideas themselves be real?

(maybe I need to research more)</p>\n\n<p>Rebirth - We do not have many examples of this happening, Buddhism arose from Hinduism, and somehow this concept was already there for a long time. Dalai Lama selection is done by testing reincarnation. If rebirth is not true, then a lot of things in Buddhism would be falsified.</p>\n\n<p>If somehow it gets proven that there is no rebirth, what&#39;s the USP of Buddhism? Isn&#39;t it pity that so many people <em>wasted</em>&nbsp;their lives in pursuit of freedom from the cycle of birth-rebirth (which never even existed)? OTOH, did they have any life <em>(a conventional life that would fit into normal society)</em> in the first place, because if they had such life, it would have found its way and they would not have turned monks?</p>\n\n<p>Ok, but even if they had no life, the waste a potential life.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"mentions-texteditor__content\">One of the arguments for the theory of reincarnation is this: Many times it has been seen where ducks have been hatched by hens, that, as soon as they come out of the eggs, they flew to water, and the mother thought they would be drowned. If experience be the only source of knowledge, where did these chickens learn to pick up food, or the ducklings that the water was their natural element? If you say it is instinct, it means nothing&mdash;it is simply giving it a word, but is no explanation. What is this instinct? We have many instincts in ourselves. For instance, most of you ladies play the piano, and remember, when you first learned, how carefully you had to put your fingers on the black and the white keys, one after the other, but now, after long years of practice, you can talk with your friends, and your hand goes on just the same. It has become instinct, it becomes automatic, but so far as we know, all the cases which we now regard as automatic are degenerated reason.</p>\n\n<p class=\"mentions-texteditor__content\">In the language of the Yogi, instinct is involved reason. Discrimination becomes involved, and gets to be automatic Samskaras. Therefore it is perfectly logical to think that all we call instinct in this world is simply involved reason. As reason cannot come without experience, all instinct is, therefore, the result of past experience. Chickens fear the hawk, and ducklings love the water, and these are both the result of past experience, and these are both the result of past experience. Then the question is whether that experience belongs to a particular soul, or to the body simply, whether this experience which comes to the duck is the duck&rsquo;s forefather&rsquo;s experience, or the duck&rsquo;s own experience. Modern scientific menhold that it belongs to the body, but the Yogis hold that it is the experience of the soul, transmitted through the body. This is called the theory of reincarnation. We have seen that all of our knowledge, whether we call it perception or reason, or instinct, must come through that one channel called experience, and all that we know call instinct is the result of past experience, degenerated into instinct, and that instinct regenerates into reason again. So on throughout the universe, and upon this has been built one of the chief arguments for reincarnation, in India.</p>\n\n<p class=\"mentions-texteditor__content\">One more skepticism about these &quot;enlightened&quot; people is: why are they in such a necessity to impart wisdom, to help others? It&#39;s ok for others that they do, but this necessity, compulsion is doubtful.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<hr />\n<p lang=\"en-US\">Sigmund Freud books: The Interpretation of Dreams, The Ego and the Id</p>\n\n<hr />\n<p lang=\"en-US\">Okay, I get it, that all the ideas of not-self, higher consciousness may be derived due to our learnings (what we hear, what we see, what we imagine combined), from thoughts themselves, but the fact that it occurred for the first time means it either originated from pure imagination, or they saw the truth?</p>\n\n<p lang=\"en-US\">But what if you consider that imagination is not pure? (Imagination also is a function)</p>\n\n<p lang=\"en-US\">How did this sense of higher consciousness occur for the first first time? Was it <em>realization</em>, was it an effect of some drug/plant?</p>\n\n<hr />\n<p lang=\"en-US\">5 aggregates of self: Form, Feelings, Perception, Mental Formations, Consciousness</p>\n\n<p lang=\"en-US\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If I remove one(/some) of them, does it make sense if I say that I am not the same as I was, and hence I have got rid of that person.</p>\n\n<hr />\n<p lang=\"en-US\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no magic in being happy. I can be happy without reason, just by thinking <em>(it&#39;s easy, all you need is a calm and clear mind)</em>, but sustaining that happiness and securing that happiness, is a challenge.</p>\n\n<p lang=\"en-US\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In fact, anybody can become happy anytime. But we ordinary mortals need props to sustain and secure that happiness.</p>\n\n<hr />\n<p lang=\"en-US\">&nbsp;&nbsp;We like to think that humans are special. But in a normal flow of life, there is nothing special about an average human. An average human is just reacting to the environment forced by nature and nurture. Nature and nurture constantly play a dual; and habit, passion, attitude come out as the result of this dual. Nature and nurture affect psychology and physiology. Physiology and psychology also affect each other. An average human is not so special compared to an average animal. An average human is just another animal with a wider range of senses and brain cells, resulting&nbsp;in a somewhat wider spectrum of consciousness. But even with all the senses and consciousness, an average human lives unconsciously, just reacting to the environment forced by nature and nurture. An average human likes to think that (s)he has control, but fails to recognize that the control is just an illusion. The universe is a multi-variable system, an average human tries to control one/few variables, and correlates it with the outcome and control,&nbsp; but fails to see that the result is a combined effect of all the variables in the system. An average human thinks that (s)he has some identity, but fails to recognize that the very identity is an illusion which has been imprinted on his/her mind. An average human is nothing but a bit of consciousness bundled with nature(comprised of genetic materials), nurture(comprised of the pre-natal/natal/post-natal environment).</p>\n\n<p lang=\"en-US\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This limited consciousness bundled with forces of nature and nurture results in psychological and physiological identity,</p>\n\n<p lang=\"en-US\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Like, Dislike, Emotions (Anger, Calm, Affection, etc) all result from this bundle. The interesting thing is that this&nbsp;is not very different in animals.</p>\n\n<p lang=\"en-US\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; An average human feels affection/love, anger, in very much the same way as other animals.</p>\n\n<p lang=\"en-US\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; An average human thinks that there is a soulmate for everyone, what they fail to recognize that all the traits in their solumate are not something special, they are just complicated reactions of many forces working together.</p>\n\n<p lang=\"en-US\">But there is one thing that makes humans special: the ability to think so much, and the control resulting from training&nbsp;of the mind, the ability to break this chain of nature and nurture <em>(but even this breakage might be an illusion)</em>.</p>\n\n<hr />\n<p lang=\"en-US\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There&#39;s so much debate about Consciousness and Intelligence. Some say that it&#39;s something special, some say that it&#39;s just information processing and reaction; that we can reduce it to logic.</p>\n\n<p lang=\"en-US\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I find it very analogous to romantic love. For lovers, it is something special that they feel towards each other.</p>\n\n<p lang=\"en-US\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While onlookers can easily tell that it&#39;s just about compatibility match on an emotional, psychological level.</p>\n\n<p lang=\"en-US\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Can anybody prove that love is just an emotional game and not something special?</p>\n\n<p lang=\"en-US\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Well, you can; but it won&#39;t matter for the lovers, they will continue feeling special and onlookers will doubt occasionally that &quot;Are we missing something?&quot;</p>\n\n<p lang=\"en-US\">&nbsp; &nbsp; The same thing goes with Consciousness and Intelligence, you can reduce it to logic and enact it in AI toys, but it seems that there will always be &quot;something more&quot; which cannot be captured in logic and algorithms.</p>\n\n<hr />\n<p lang=\"en-US\">As long as you are revelling in the high tides of energy, like enjoying overpowering, lust, anger, or are under the influence of substances; you have no problem.</p>\n\n<p lang=\"en-US\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The problem occurs when you come down from these high tides. And it can happen anytime, for any reason (including external factors, and self-realisation; yes mind is mysterious, it can turn anytime).</p>\n\n<p lang=\"en-US\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That&#39;s the time when satisfaction arising from virtues come into play. That&#39;s when the soul matters. That&#39;s when altruism, compassion, serenity, spirituality, enlightenment etc matter.</p>\n\n<p lang=\"en-US\">&nbsp; Why be good? So that your soul helps you in these times.</p>\n\n<hr />\n<p lang=\"en-US\">&nbsp;&nbsp; Why did we develop fear as our defence mechanism? Why did the meditative and attentive mind did not develop as a result of evolution?</p>\n\n<hr />\n<p lang=\"en-US\">&nbsp;If I imagine a certain situation&nbsp;and enjoy it without forming some kind of expectation, that can still be enjoyable, after all, you enjoy dreams as much as real events; until you realize that they are not true. But if I imagine and form expectations, that will lead to suffering.</p>\n\n<hr />\n<p lang=\"en-US\">Suppose we catch a criminal who has murdered someone.
