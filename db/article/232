Two Optimal Organizational Forms</p>\n\n<p>The market was seen as the optimal institution for the production and exchange of private goods</p>\n\n<p>For nonprivate goods, on the other hand, one needed &ldquo;the&rdquo; government to impose rules and taxes to force self-interested individuals to contribute necessary resources and refrain from self-seeking activities.</p>\n\n<p>Without a hierarchical government to induce compliance, self-seeking citizens and officials would fail to generate efficient levels of public goods, such as peace and security, at multiple scales</p>\n\n<p>B. Two Types of Goods</p>\n\n<ol>\n\t<li>Pure Private Goods: Excludable &amp; Rivalrous. You can be excluded from consuming my private goods unless you pay for it. If you consume it, someone else cannot.</li>\n\t<li>Public Goods: Non-Excludable, Non-Rivalrous. It&#39;s impossible to stop someone from consuming it without paying for it. Consumption by you doesn&#39;t stop someone else from consuming it as well.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>This leaves people as either goods owners, consumers or voters. Public became government-owned managed by a public hierarchy elected by voters.</p>\n\n<p>This was later modified to include third type &mdash; Club goods. It was feasible for groups of individuals to create private associations (clubs) to provide themselves nonrivalrous but small-scale goods and services that they could enjoy while excluding nonmembers from participation and consumption of benefits.</p>\n\n<p>C. One Model of the Individual</p>\n\n<p>The assumption that all individuals are fully rational was generally accepted in mainstream economics and game theory.</p>\n\n<p>Utility as originally conceived is not the same as profit. But now it is believed to be so.</p>\n\n<p>Polycentric Arrangements:</p>\n\n<p>Earlier studies were on water industries in California, Policing and public safety in&nbsp;Indianapolis,&nbsp;Nashville, Tennessee etc.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>The conclusion in short was that&nbsp;<span class=\"math\">\\text{Complexity} \\ne \\text{Chaos}</span>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Goods model was proposed to be modified:-</p>\n\n<ol>\n\t<li>Replacing the term &ldquo;rivalry of consumption&rdquo; with &ldquo;subtractability of use.&rdquo;</li>\n\t<li>Conceptualizing subtractability of use and excludability to vary from low to high rather than characterizing them as either present or absent.</li>\n\t<li>Overtly adding a very important fourth type of good&mdash;common-pool resources&mdash;that shares the attribute of subtractability with private goods and difficulty of exclusion with&nbsp;public goods (V. Ostrom and E. Ostrom 1977). Forests, water systems, fisheries, and the global atmosphere are all common-pool resources of immense importance for the survival of humans on this earth.</li>\n\t<li>Changing the name of a &ldquo;club&rdquo; good to a &ldquo;toll&rdquo; good since many goods that share these characteristics are provided by small scale public as well as private associations.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<table class=\"ui-draggable ui-draggable-handle ui-resizable\" style=\"position: relative\">\n\t<tbody>\n\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t<td class=\"ui-resizable\">\n\t\t\t<div class=\"ui-resizable-handle ui-resizable-s\" style=\"z-index: 90;\">&nbsp;</div>\n\t\t\t</td>\n\t\t\t<td class=\"ui-resizable\">\n\t\t\t<div class=\"ui-resizable-handle ui-resizable-s\" style=\"z-index: 90;\">&nbsp;</div>\n\t\t\t</td>\n\t\t</tr>\n\t\t<tr width=\"100%\">\n\t\t\t<td class=\"ui-resizable\">\n\t\t\t<div class=\"ui-resizable-handle ui-resizable-s\" style=\"z-index: 90;\">&nbsp;</div>\n\t\t\t</td>\n\t\t\t<td class=\"ui-resizable\" colspan=\"2\" style=\"padding: 5px; text-align: center\">Subtractability of Use\n\t\t\t<div class=\"ui-resizable-handle ui-resizable-s\" style=\"z-index: 90;\">&nbsp;</div>\n\t\t\t</td>\n\t\t</tr>\n\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t<td class=\"verticalTableHeader ui-resizable\" style=\"\n    width: 200px;\n\">\n\t\t\t<p>Difficulty of excluding potential beneficiaries</p>\n\n\t\t\t<div class=\"ui-resizable-handle ui-resizable-s\" style=\"z-index: 90;\">&nbsp;</div>\n\t\t\t</td>\n\t\t\t<td class=\"ui-resizable\">\n\t\t\t<table border=\"1\" class=\"data\" style=\"border-collapse: collapse; width: 600px; margin-left: -15px; margin-top: 0px; text-align: center; height: 300px;\">\n\t\t\t\t<tbody>\n\t\t\t\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<th class=\"ui-resizable\" style=\"text-align: center\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"ui-resizable-handle ui-resizable-e\" style=\"z-index: 90;\">&nbsp;</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</th>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<th class=\"xheader ui-resizable\" style=\"text-align: center\">High\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"ui-resizable-handle ui-resizable-e\" style=\"z-index: 90;\">&nbsp;</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</th>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<th class=\"xheader ui-resizable\" style=\"text-align: center\">Low\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"ui-resizable-handle ui-resizable-e\" style=\"z-index: 90;\">&nbsp;</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</th>\n\t\t\t\t\t</tr>\n\t\t\t\t\t<tr class=\"data\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<th class=\"yheader ui-resizable\" style=\"text-align: center; padding-left: 4%; padding-right: 4%;\">High\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"ui-resizable-handle ui-resizable-e\" style=\"z-index: 90;\">&nbsp;</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</th>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<td class=\"ui-resizable\" style=\"\"><i>Common-pool resources</i>:<br />\n\t\t\t\t\t\tgroundwater basins, lakes, irrigation systems, fisheries, forests, etc.</td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<td class=\"ui-resizable\" style=\"\"><i>Public goods:</i><br />\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpeace and security of a community, national defense, knowledge, fire protection, weather forecasts, etc</td>\n\t\t\t\t\t</tr>\n\t\t\t\t\t<tr class=\"data\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<th class=\"yheader ui-resizable\" style=\"text-align: center; padding-left: 4%; padding-right: 4%;\">Low\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"ui-resizable-handle ui-resizable-e\" style=\"z-index: 90;\">&nbsp;</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</th>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<td class=\"ui-resizable\" style=\"\"><i>Private goods:</i><br />\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfood, clothing, automobiles, etc.</td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<td class=\"ui-resizable\" style=\"\"><i>Toll goods:</i><br />\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttheaters, private clubs, daycare centers</td>\n\t\t\t\t\t</tr>\n\t\t\t\t</tbody>\n\t\t\t</table>\n\n\t\t\t<div class=\"ui-resizable-handle ui-resizable-s\" style=\"z-index: 90;\">&nbsp;</div>\n\t\t\t</td>\n\t\t</tr>\n\t</tbody>\n</table>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h2>Developing a Framework for Analyzing the Diversity of Human Situations</h2>\n\n<p>Institutional Analysis and Development Framework (IAD)</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>With this framework we can compare different theories.&nbsp;Microlevel theories including game theory, microeconomic theory, transaction cost theory, and public goods/common-pool resource theories are examples of specific theories compatible with the IAD framework.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>External Variables = { Biophysical conditions, Attributes of Community, Rules-in-use }</p>\n\n<p>Biophysical conditions = { Goods,.. }</p>\n\n<p>Attributes of Community = { History of prior interactions,&nbsp;internal homogeneity or heterogeneity of key attributes, Knowledge and&nbsp;social capital of those who may participate or be affected by others&nbsp;}</p>\n\n<p>Rules in use&nbsp;&rArr; Common understanding of participants,&nbsp;related to who must, must not, or may take which actions affecting others subject to sanctions. Rules may evolve.</p>\n\n<p>External Variables impact Action Situations to generate patterns of interactions and outcomes that are evaluated by participants (as well as scholars studying it), and feed back on both External Variables and Action Situations.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;It is not feasible to develop a formal game (or even an Agent Based Model) to analyze the more complex empirical settings with many variables of relevance affecting outcomes and of importance for institutional analysis. It is possible, however, to use a common set of structural elements to develop structured coding forms for data collection and analysis. And one can design experiments using a common set of variables for many situations of interest to political economists and then examine why particular behavior and outcomes occur in some situations and not in others.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>&quot;The classic models have been used to view those who are involved in a prisoner&rsquo;s dilemma game or other social dilemmas as always trapped in the situation without capabilities to change the structure themselves. This analytical step was a retrogressive step in the theories used to analyze the human condition.&quot;</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Garrett Hardin&rsquo;s (1968) portrayal of the users of a common-pool resource&mdash;a pasture open to all&mdash;being trapped in an inexorable tragedy of overuse and destruction has been widely accepted since it was consistent with the prediction of no cooperation in a prisoner&rsquo;s dilemma or other social dilemma games.</p>\n\n<p>It captured the attention of scholars and policymakers across the world. Many presumed that all common-pool resources were owned by no one. Thus, it was thought that government officials had to impose new external variables (e.g., new policies) to prevent destruction by users who could not do anything other than destroy the resources on which their own future (as well as the rest of our futures) depended.</p>\n\n<p>In CPR dilemmas where individuals do not know one another, cannot communicate effectively, and thus cannot develop agreements, norms, and sanctions, aggregate predictions derived from models of rational individuals in a noncooperative game receive substantial support. These are sparse environments and full rationality appears to be a reasonable assumption in them.</p>\n\n<p>On the other hand, the capacity to overcome dilemmas and create effective governance occurred far more frequently than expected and depended upon the structure of the resource itself and whether the rules-in-use developed by users were linked effectively to this structure (William Blomquist et al. 1994). In all self-organized systems, we found that users had created boundary rules for determining who could use the resource, choice rules related to the allocation of the flow of resource units, and active forms of monitoring and local sanctioning of rule breakers (ibid.: 301). On the other hand, we did not find a single case where harvesters used the &ldquo;grim trigger&rdquo; strategy&mdash;a form of punishment that was posited in many theoretical arguments for how individuals could solve repeated dilemmas (Prajit K. Dutta 1990: 264).</p>\n\n<p>The meta-analysis of existing field cases helped to identify five property rights that individuals using a common-pool resource might cumulatively have: (i) access&mdash;the right to enter a specified property,4 (ii) withdrawal&mdash;the right to harvest specific products from a resource, (iii) management&mdash;the right to transform the resource and regulate internal use patterns, (iv) exclusion&mdash;the right to decide who will have access, withdrawal, or management rights, and (v) alienation&mdash;the right to lease or sell any of the other four rights.</p>\n\n<p>The seven types of rules are:</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>Boundary rules that specify how actors were to be chosen to enter or leave these positions;</li>\n\t<li>Position rules that specify a set of positions and how many actors hold each one;</li>\n\t<li>Choice rules that specify which actions are assigned to an actor in a position;</li>\n\t<li>Information rules that specify channels of communication among actors and what information must, may, or must not be shared;</li>\n\t<li>Scope rules that specify the outcomes that could be affected;</li>\n\t<li>Aggregation rules (such as majority or unanimity rules) that specify how the decisions of actors at a node were to be mapped to intermediate or final outcomes; and</li>\n\t<li>Payoff rules that specify how benefits and costs were to be distributed to actors in positions (Crawford and E. Ostrom 2005).</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n","authorId":null,"subject":"hidden","tags":null,"img":null,"summary":null,"lastUpdated":"2020-06-07T09:55:52.728+0000"}
