{"name":"Intra-Personal Psychology","id":188,"content":"<h3><strong>The intertwining of body and mind:</strong></h3>\n\n<hr />\n<p>Observe that when you are happy you tend to smile automatically; Observe that when you force yourself to smile, your mind gradually moves towards happiness. Observe that this change happens quickly if someone else whom you like forces you to smile (by a joke, by some quirky action or whatever). <em>[I&#39;m using the word force here, because it breaks the <strong>inertia,</strong> in the absence of which you could go from non-happy to happy state at your&nbsp;will]</em></p>\n\n<p>Observe how a single random negative thought starts, grows and affects the state of the body, it can make the body lousy, energyless. Observe how the lousiness of the body attracts negative thoughts in the mind.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Observe that your mind tends to become calmer when your body is harmonized by actions such as Yoga, Meditation poses which make body at ease; Observe that your body can easily be in a harmonized state, and be at ease if your mind is calm.</p>\n\n<p>Observe that balance of body begets balance of mind, and the balance of mind begets balance of body. Similarly, a healthy mind resides in a healthy body, and a healthy body results from a healthy mind.</p>\n\n<p>Observe that the expansion of the strength of the body is dependent on the strength of the mind; Observe that the strength of the mind is dependent on the body (a body in disease tends not to have a strong mind, your will power diminishes).</p>\n\n<p>Observe that the dullness of mind produces dullness in body, and dullness of the body produces dullness in mind. Observe that when you sit in erect position, your mind tends to go towards active state, and when you sit slouching your mind tends to go towards dullness.</p>\n\n<p>Observe the effect of pain in the body on the mind; Observe the effect of suffering in the mind on the pain in the body. Observe that, if anything, draws your attention away from the pain point in the body, there remains no pain <em>(at least as long as there is no attention; and gradually it disappears)</em>. What can force your attention away from the bodily pain -&nbsp;&nbsp;One example is motivation (intrinsic or extrinsic), when you are attented by a trainer (e.g. in a Gym or in military). Observe that by forcing your mind to accept pain, and not focus on the pain in body, your body gradually becomes unaware of [, accustomed to] the pain&nbsp;<em>(This is quite obvious in any programme which has rigourous training routine e.g. in military)</em>. Observe that a person whose body tends to [consiously] become unaware&nbsp;of pain (or, resistant to it), his mind also tends to move away from suffering. <em>(Suffering means pain of the mind)</em></p>\n\n<p>Observe that the suffering (of mind) tends to move body towards pain and disease; Observe that the pain, disease&nbsp;in the body tends to move the mind towards suffering.</p>\n\n<p>Observe that an angry mind results in an unrested/agitated&nbsp;body, and unrested body tends to make mind more susceptible to anger.</p>\n\n<p>Observe that when you have habit of waking up at 9 a.m. and set an alarm to wake up at 6 a.m. if you force your mind to become active your body gets ready to get out of the bed, also Observe that if you force your body to become active by getting out of the bed quickly your mind also becomes (gadually if not immediately) active and accustomed.</p>\n\n<p>How much and in what ways does the body affect the mind, and how much does the mind affect the body, is neither constant nor universally objective. Which comes first - the mind or the body? It all depends on when you happen to observe it.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Observe that a slight change in mind can affect a bodily action (for example, when running a thought comes in your mind that you will not be able to run more and you suddenly feel more tired, unable to continue); Observe that a slight change in body can affect the state of mind (for example, a simple action as getting up and walking can get you out of a depressive thought).</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>The effect of novelty on the mind [and body]:</strong></p>\n\n<p>Why do you laugh at a joke? Do you laugh more at a new joke than at a worn-out joke? Do you laugh at the same old joke but in a different setting?</p>\n\n<p>Why do you like seeing new places? Why do you like meeting new people? Or, coming across new stories, new ideas?</p>\n\n<p>What effect does novelty (coming across something&nbsp;new) have on your mind? - Does it please your mind?&nbsp;Does it refresh your mind? Does it make you happy? Does it bring you out of some mental state in which you were stuck?</p>\n\n<p>Observe that what your mind considers novel, is itself dependent on what your mind already has and how it handles what it already has.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Sometimes, a simple victory as putting a ball into a hole can be considered novel by your mind. Sometimes, making a person smile can be considered novel by your mind. Sometimes, a new sarcasm can be considered novel by your mind. At times, none of it is considered novel.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>The hunger for novelty is so much that even if the most desirable object is attained by mind, it still looks for something new. What&#39;s your most desirable object &mdash; a beutiful spouse, a beautiful house, a delicious food, ...? If you are supplied constantly whatever is the most desirable to you while at the same time you are mostly restricted from new things, your mind suffers as much when it does not receive that which is desired by it.</p>\n\n<p>Observe that the novelty in bodily actions satisfy the hunger of mind; Observe that novelty in mind [mental states] satisfies the hunger [for novelty] of the body.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<hr />\n<h3>&nbsp;</h3>\n\n<h3><strong>The intertwining of the mental states:</strong></h3>\n\n<p>...</p>\n\n<h3>The intertwining of Memory,&nbsp;Mind and Body:</h3>\n\n<p>Here we are concerned about bigger picture of memory which records the evolutionary process.</p>\n\n<p>...</p>\n\n<hr />\n<h2>Mental States</h2>\n\n<p><strong>Loneliness</strong></p>\n\n<p>Man is a social animal. How do we know this? &mdash; Because you can simply observe it, because scientists have studied it, because it&#39;s the way history of humanity (and the history of your family) has progressed in time. Because if you are left alone for an extremely long time, it&#39;s rare that you&#39;ll survive.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Some remarks from people:</strong></p>\n\n<div style=\"margin-left: 10px; border-left: solid black thin; padding-left: 5px;\">\n<p><em>&quot;Paradox -&nbsp;If you find yourself in a social situation and you tell people that you have no friends; nobody wants to be your friend.&quot;</em></p>\n\n<p><em>&quot;I actually like being alone, but sometimes I&#39;ll feel a want for some social contact, then I remember why I like being alone.&quot;</em></p>\n\n<p><em>&quot;[It&#39;s] Hard to have a social circle when you&#39;re poor... having friends is costly&quot; </em></p>\n\n<p><em>&quot;The worse thing is when you have friends, but if you don&#39;t call then they don&#39;t call back, or they isolate you from social activities because what you do or like is something very different from what everyone do&quot;</em></p>\n\n<p><em>&quot;There&rsquo;s a big difference between being alone and feeling lonely&quot;</em></p>\n\n<p><em>&quot;</em><em>It is possible to be lonely in a crowd of friends, even when you are smiling&quot;</em></p>\n\n<p><em>&quot;Technology is at the root of this problem&quot;</em></p>\n</div>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>Solutions:</strong></p>\n\n<p>&quot;<em>Getting out and meeting people</em>&quot; - Is it so simple? In some cases, it can result in success, in others it just means <em>&quot;being lonely in public places&quot;</em></p>\n\n<p><em>Community of loners</em> - How much success has it achieved so far?</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>Depression</strong></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>Anger</strong></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>Jealousy</strong></p>\n\n<p><em>&quot;Jealousy is not a curse or some mental illness.
