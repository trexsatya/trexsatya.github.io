They don&#39;t think about the thinking and the thought itself.<br />\n<em>&nbsp; <span style=\"color:#8e44ad;\">&nbsp;[Everyone at every level should be aware of this.]</span></em></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#8e44ad;\">&nbsp; &nbsp;<em>[Actually, if you take this seriously. you will ultimately realize that most of the times rationality, dialectics fails. Analyse something by considering <strong>ALL THE ASPECTS</strong>, and ultimately you will find that you can&#39;t even decide what is good and what is bad, what is right and what is wrong. But anyway, we have to deal with various phenomena in our lives and&nbsp;the world in general, so we have to take some stance.]</em></span></p>\n\n<p><strong>Can we view history primarily as an economic class structure?</strong>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The&nbsp;Hierarchical structure is present in nature everywhere. Hierarchical competition among human beings is natural then.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Human&nbsp;beings struggle not just for economics, they struggle within themselves. There is psychological and spiritual warfare going on within them.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;We are also at odds with nature. We come into life starving and lonesome, and then we make social arrangements to ameliorate that. Hierarchical organizations might have a positive element. We have to make some form of organization to solve complex problems. It might result in inequality, but it also happens to be very efficient in distributing resources.&nbsp;<em><span style=\"color:#8e44ad;\">[Nature shapes our existence.]</span><br />\n&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</em>Human hierarchies are not fundamentally predicated on power (biological, anthropological evidence suggests that). You don&#39;t rise to a position of authority that&#39;s reliable by human society by exploiting others. It&#39;s a very unstable means of obtaining power. <span style=\"color:#8e44ad;\"><em>[It&#39;s unstable, but it was the easiest way. Although now things are changing, <strong>generally</strong> you don&#39;t see someone <strong>DIRECTLY</strong> exercising their power upon you. But it doesn&#39;t mean that this game of power has ended. Given our human history, it&#39;s very naive to even hope for it.]</em></span></p>\n\n<p><strong>Can we divide society into binary classes? like <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proletariat\" target=\"_blank\">Proletariat</a> and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bourgeoisie\">Bourgeoisie</a>? Is it wise to do so?</strong><br />\n&nbsp; &nbsp;How would you even decide who belongs to which class?<em>&nbsp;[Especially in today&#39;s time]</em>&nbsp;for example, shareholders of a company, are they exploiter, or exploit-ee. There are multiple ways in which you could inadvertently&nbsp;fall into Bourgeoisie class, it could be a result of inheritance, good education, or hard work &amp; accumulation of wealth throughout your life. An example of this misinterpretation of economic class in history is <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kulak\" target=\"_blank\">Kulaks</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Is it wise to consider that all of the good is on one side, and all of the bad is on the other side/class? <span style=\"color:#8e44ad;\"><em>[But biases are present in us in one form or another! Rather than analyzing on an individual basis, we take shortcuts&nbsp;and attribute properties to groups, even our brain neurologically works in this way, we have shortcut pathways inside our brain, &#39;when you see a rope in the dark, your brain doesn&#39;t stop there to analyze and find out whether it&#39;s a snake or not, it just prompts you to step&nbsp;back&#39;].</em></span></p>\n\n<p>It&#39;s classical Group Identity thinking. <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Identity_politics\" target=\"_blank\">Identity Politics</a> does the same thing, and once you divide people into groups and pit them against one another, it&#39;s very easy to assume that all the evil in the world can be attributed&nbsp;to&nbsp;one side, and all the good is on the other side.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>What makes sure that the class (actually a chosen segment of this class) which is considered oppressed, will make a good system&nbsp;when given power/dictatorship? Is it even possible?</strong></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp; Sudden access to power, wouldn&#39;t it corrupt them? Social pressure is one of the determining factors of human character.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp; How would you even select that segment of the group, who is&nbsp;going to rule?&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>What&#39;s wrong with Profit (oriented) market?</strong></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp; That it is theft. - It might be, but not in all cases. Profit makes security for times not so great. How can you grow without profit? It&#39;s also a good constraint on wasted labour. Run enterprise on a for-profit basis, and you will avoid forms of stupidity fearing that you will be punished by the market.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>Compared to free-market, will a group of people (who run the society) be hyper-productive?</strong></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;The idea that this group of ruling people will be so hyper-productive that there will be enough material goods for everyone, and so people will be engaging in meaningful creative works from which they had been alienated, and utopia will be automatically ushered in.&nbsp;<br />\n&nbsp; Is this form of utopia suitable for everyone? We were built for troubles, and if we were every handed everything we needed in a silver platter, the first thing we would do is engage in some form of creative destruction, just to engage ourselves and have an adventure of our lifetime.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp; Shouldn&#39;t we let the system which has been efficient in producing material security which is some form of free-market, and see how it plays out?</p>\n\n<p>We do not know how to set up an economic system without inequality. No one has ever managed that. It&#39;s also not evident that the more free economies (in the west) produce more inequality than the less free markets. Free market also produces wealth, other systems only produce inequality. GDP growth is evident. We are eradicating poverty at an unparalleled rate seen in human history.</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#8e44ad;\"><em>[It&#39;s quite evident that the current form of profit-oriented, free-market has resulted in the eradication of poverty. That&#39;s not the problem, the problem is that all these good outcomes are by-products, they are not the goal (or even interest) of the free market. Tell me, whatever amount of wealth, resources and technology we have currently (combined on the world level), is that not enough to almost completely eradicate the poverty? But that doesn&#39;t happen, why? - Because that&#39;s not the goal, that&#39;s a side-effect.]</em></span></p>\n\n<p>China is a success story combining authoritarian State and wild capitalist dynamics. They do it on behalf of the happiness of the community. But are they any happier?&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Although Dalai Lama justifies Tibetan Buddhism as the pursuit of happiness and the avoidance of pain. <em><span style=\"color:#8e44ad;\">[Maybe this is a misinterpretation of Dalai Lama. I don&#39;t know about Tibetan Buddhism, but Buddhism, in general, does not focus on happiness itself, it focusses on <strong>EQUANIMITY</strong>, which is considered real happiness and peace, and this is very clear as per their meditation techniques.]</span></em><br />\n<br />\nHappiness as a goal of life is a very problematic notion. Psycho-analysis tells us that we humans are very good at sabotaging our pursuit of happiness. In our daily lives, we pretend to desire things which we don&#39;t really desire. So the worst thing that can happen to us, is that we get what we officially desire. For happiness, we have to find some cause beyond the mere struggle of pleasurable survival.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>We are responsible for our burdens <span style=\"color:#8e44ad;\"><em>[especially in the modern world]</em>. </span>We are never just instruments of some higher cause.<span style=\"color:#8e44ad;\"> <em>[Are we not? In a world dominated by religion, the higher cause was definitely God. But in the modern world, the higher cause is the political-economic structure itself and technology is the means of this instrumentation. Remember? We do not really desire things we pretend to desire? Why, because that&#39;s what is being incepted in people&#39;s mind for the growth of this shapeless entity which (over)feeds the passionate, hungry people]</em></span></p>\n\n<p>While without religion, good people would have been doing good things, and bad people doing bad things, only something like religion can make good people do bad things. If God doesn&#39;t exist, then everything is permitted. The lesson of today&#39;s terrorism is: if there is a God, then everything, even blowing off hundreds of innocent people is permitted. <span style=\"color:#8e44ad;\"><em>[Are we still not convinced that religion itself is not dangerous, the usage of religion as a tool, misinterpretations of ideas is dangerous, I think it is quite known now that Jihad which is considered the dogma that provokes such horrible activities as blowing off&nbsp;even innocent people, is a misinterpreted concept. Jihad was originally meant to purify yourself.]</em></span></p>\n\n<p>Renunciation of pleasure can easily turn into pleasure of renunciation itself <span style=\"color:#8e44ad;\"><em>[That&#39;s why in all meditation techniques, there is a guideline to break this off, as soon as you find that you are getting attached to the pleasure arisen from detachment, you make effort to eliminate it and regain equanimity]</em></span>. Do not fall in love with your suffering. Never make the mistake that your suffering is proof of your authenticity <span style=\"color:#8e44ad;\"><em>[People can easily misinterpret this to justify inclination towards the idea that &quot;just enjoy!&nbsp;it doesn&#39;t matter!&quot;]</em></span>. Self-denigration can also be used for profit.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Even if what a jealous husband claims about his wife (that she sleeps with other men) is true, his jealousy is nonetheless pathological. The pathological element is the husband&#39;s need for jealousy as the only way for him to sustain his identity.&quot; <span style=\"color:#8e44ad;\"><em>[If we&nbsp;take this further into all aspects, we can easily see that all of our strong emotions especially the negative ones like Anger, Jealousy, Resentment, Pride are just to assert our identity. Just think about it: &#39;Someone says a swear word to you, and you get furious (especially when someone inferior to you does this), nothing has changed in the world, and yet you consider it worth a fight. Why? - Because it goes against your self-image, pride, you consider it a blow to your identity.&#39; ]</em></span> This is something like what Nazis were doing. <em><span style=\"color:#8e44ad;\">[Scapegoating on Jews]</span>?</em>&nbsp;This is what people are doing when they take a stance against immigration.</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#8e44ad;\"><em>[This identity thing is at the root of all the problems in the world.]</em></span></p>\n\n<p>Hitler provided a story to Germans for their then situation (which was bad, unstable): that they are in this mess because of the Jews. We make stories to justify what we do. <span style=\"color:#8e44ad;\"><em>[Psychological studies suggest this is true. Spiritual ideas have been suggesting this since ages, but we feel (in general) an unknown intellectual aversion towards spiritual concepts and talks]</em></span></p>\n\n<p>One should stop blaming pleasure-seeking self-centred love for our woes. The true opposite of self-centered love is not altruism (a concern for the common good), but envy, resentment which makes me act against my own interests. Evil is more profoundly spiritual, in some sense more spiritual than goodness. <span style=\"color:#8e44ad;\"><em>[What kind of spirituality people are following, I can understand why spiritual ideas have been altered to include ideas that can make normal people do bad things, but I cannot understand why intellectuals would not see this that the root of all these spiritual things was not evil, it simply cannot be, there were already many efficient systems for doing evil, why would you need spirituality to assert evil.]</em></span></p>\n\n<p>I&#39;m ready to renounce something&nbsp;so that others will also not have it. <span style=\"color:#8e44ad;\"><em>[A corrupted form of the idea of equality]</em></span></p>\n\n<p>&quot;Me-too&quot; campaign, since the years it began, has deployed unwavering obsession with perpetrators. <span style=\"color:#8e44ad;\"><em>[Which campaign, movement, revolution, setup has not been corrupted? Sooner or later, they all do.]</em></span></p>\n\n<p>Equality should not be in distribution, instead, in the creating opportunity for individuals to develop their different potentials. Paradoxically today&#39;s free-market does this.</p>\n\n<p>Free education, healthcare are no&nbsp;threat to freedom, the American way of life, etc, instead, it will create such a space, to help us focus more on creative work.</p>\n\n<p>Nature itself is not a stable hierarchical system, but instead, full of improvisations. Something like French&nbsp;cuisines, whenever something goes&nbsp;wrong in the process of producing something in a standard way, they create a new dish out of it. Sexual instincts are of-course biologically determined&nbsp;but look what we made out of them, they are not limited to the mating season, they can develop into a permanent obsession, which is sustained by obstacles, that demand to be overcome, in short, into a metaphysical passion that&nbsp;perturbs the biological written with twists like endlessly prolonging satisfaction in courtly love, engaging in different perversions etc. It has become trans-functionalised, part of the culture. <span style=\"color:#8e44ad;\"><em>[<br />\n&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Although a piece of bread is essential to determine how a sandwich or burger would turn out&nbsp;but is that the only thing that determines the taste of sandwich/burger? Could you even say that it is the core thing that determines this?<br />\n&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For those who know about computers, the hardware is definitely what ultimately determines the efficiency of the system, but is that it? Can you have a sophisticated system without deploying a sophisticated software on top of it?&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Then, why do we keep trying to justify human behaviour by comparing it to the biological,&nbsp;evolutionary instincts? It should be studied, definitely, but keeping in mind that humans are able to deploy a sophisticated software of humanity&nbsp;on shitty hardware&nbsp;and do a pretty good job at it.&nbsp;It is difficult, but humans are always capable of rising above animalistic instincts, also it is not that just thinking will enable you to rise above these instincts, it requires training, just like everything else does.<br />\n]</em></span></p>\n\n<p>It&#39;s not just that in spite of all natural, cultural differences, the same&nbsp;divine&nbsp;spark dwells in everyone, and this divine spark enables us to create the Holy Ghost or Holy Spirit. Hierarchy, family values are somewhat abolished. There is no longer Jew or&nbsp;Greek, there is no longer male or female in Christ.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Democracy extends this logic to a political stance. In spite of all the differences in competence, the ultimate decision should stay with all of us. <span style=\"color:#8e44ad;\"><em>[Political forms predate any sophisticated understanding of spirituality I GUESS, so this seems not a&nbsp;good point, on the second thought, democracy is relatively a new concept, on another second thought, probably it is not, Aristotle analysed it quite a bit.]</em></span></p>\n\n<p>If we give power to a group of expert people, there could be fake experts legitimizing their rules. Can we believe in the wisdom of ordinary people? We often need a master figure to push ourselves out of inertia, that forces us to be free <span style=\"color:#8e44ad;\"><em>[from responsibility].</em>&nbsp;<em>[This is the reason people become slave, both in literal and in a deeper sense, they want to outsource everything, even their redemption. But it is old oriental wisdom that a person himself has to attain his salvation, you could try and use other people&#39;s&nbsp;way/tools, but ultimately the responsibility and capability is with you only]</em></span></p>\n\n<p>If a child says he respects his father because he is a competent and good guy, this is an affront to the father&#39;s authority <span style=\"color:#8e44ad;\"><em>[Why? - Again, because of the assertion of identity, maybe]</em></span>. Power in the sense of asserting authority, cannot be directly grounded in competence. It is much more mysterious. Political power and competence should be kept apart.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Free-markets do not focus on commons e.g. ecological dangers.</p>\n\n<p>Are we sure that we are in ecological danger? - We&#39;ve had wrong predictions. But we do have the prospect of catastrophe. <strong>We can be sure only when it&#39;s already too late</strong>.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>We are in a deep mess, we have to admit that. Even the radical measurements against ecological catastrophe can be dangerous. Example, Solar radiation management by dispersing aerosol in the environment.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>In our new century, we should say that&nbsp;maybe in the last century we tried all too fast to change the world, the time&nbsp;has come to step back and interpret.</p>\n\n<p>Commons of the internal nature. Example Neuralink. <span style=\"color:#8e44ad;\"><em>[Can we even imagine the consequences of this?]</em></span></p>\n\n<p>We live in a world which is inter-connected <span style=\"color:#8e44ad;\"><em>[technologically]</em></span>, but nonetheless deeply divided. <span style=\"color:#8e44ad;\"><em>[Pessimistic? But the truth is almost always&nbsp;pessimistic...]</em></span></p>\n\n<p>Giving shelter to refugees is not the solution, the solution is to change&nbsp;the situations&nbsp;which create&nbsp;immigration. <span style=\"color:#8e44ad;\"><em>[Changing, eliminating the source, the root of the problem, is always the best solution! But how often do we try&nbsp;this?]</em></span></p>\n\n<p>Free-market needs to be somehow regulated to solve these problems of commons. Ecology, digital control, unity of the world etc. <span style=\"color:#8e44ad;\"><em>[We do have bodies, structures which try to regulate it, but there is a vicious cycle of who controls whom. There is corruption in the regulation itself, which results from the corruption of the individuals themselves (especially individuals who are highly passionate about money, power, control). The&nbsp;economic crisis of 2008&nbsp;would not have occurred if Moodys had not been corrupted. But as we know, ultimately (almost) everything corrupts.]</em></span></p>\n\n<p>In spite of protests here and there, we will probably continue to slide towards some kind of apocalypse awaiting large catastrophes to awaken us. When someone says in spite of all the problems, there is a light at the end of the tunnel, my instant reply is, yes, and it&#39;s probably another train coming towards us.</p>\n\n<p>Democracy is the worst form of government, except for all the other forms. Similarly, Capitalism is the worst form of economic management, except for all the other forms that have failed.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Can we reduce every element of life to the economic competition? - No. But, today&#39;s market culture definitely tries to push in that direction. Sales &amp; Marketing, Advertising culture does that. Their reasons are understandable, but this is not the best way forward.</p>\n\n<p>People are more concerned with not being miserable than they are with being happy. Happiness and the&nbsp;&quot;absence of misery&quot; are two different emotional states. There is a relationship between an absolute level of income and self-reported lack of misery, pretty linear until you hit a decent working-class income. <strong>Once you get shielded from economic miseries, adding more money to your life has no benefit whatsoever.&nbsp;</strong><span style=\"color:#8e44ad;\"><em>[Again, The only thing here is that&nbsp;we do have the capability to shield (almost) everyone from the economic misery, but that is not the focus, the goal is to fill the&nbsp;bottles&nbsp;more and more, and whatever oozes out will quench the thirsty ones]</em></span></p>\n\n<p>If we add more nourished brains (which current system seems to do), we will be able to solve these problems. <span style=\"color:#8e44ad;\"><em>[Really? Let&#39;s see it like this: those who are the source of the problems discharge negative charge, and those brains who try to solve these problems discharge positive charge, there is no doubt, I guess, that both of them will reproduce, and multiply, what is the hope that positive charges will multiply enough to be able to neutralize the negative one, while it is clear, again I guess, that the multiplication of negative charge is more prevalent. Again, don&#39;t count the positive outcomes (which are side-effects), count the positive motivations].</em></span></p>\n\n<p>It&#39;s not like all the people at the top have everything, and all the people at the bottom have nothing. <span style=\"color:#8e44ad;\"><em>[The definition of nothing and everything changes, I guess. 10 Rs used to be a lot sometime, now it is nothing. So if a person went from owning zero to Rs 10 now, he still is at the same position.]</em></span></p>\n\n<p>A proper pathway forward is individual responsibilities aimed at the highest good, something that is already rooted in religious traditions. You can accept this without any religious supposition, and it&#39;s something that you do accept to some extent when you participate in the voting process. The very stability of the state depends upon the integrity of individuals&#39; character. Act as if what&#39;s good for you, and what&#39;s good for your family, and what&#39;s good for the society in a larger context. <span style=\"color:#8e44ad;\"><em>[This is what Spirituality has been saying since ages, but the power of evil nature is so strong I guess!]</em></span></p>\n\n<p>A couple of years ago, some kind of survey was done asking people &quot;Are they happy with their life&quot;. Scandinavian countries scored low, and countries like Bangladesh scored high. <span style=\"color:#8e44ad;\"><em>[If this is what people reported, I can think why it would be so. Every one of us has a social, economic, psychological, biological, spiritual profile/sphere. The size of the spheres vary. If my spheres are small, and I am getting most of what I know about in these spheres, I would definitely say I&#39;m happy. Think about this: &#39;All you know about the existence of life is that you need food, a few friends, chattering, and a few more things. And someone asks you &quot;Are you happy with your life?&quot;, your mind will collect information&nbsp;about all these things related to existence, and if you are getting enough of them, you will say &quot;Yes, I&#39;m happy&quot;&#39;. But we are not limited to minimal things, we have enlarged all our spheres so much that our mind will mostly remain in confusion about happiness, even if you were happy.]</em></span></p>\n\n<p>One of the conditions of happiness is that there be fewer&nbsp;responsibilities, democracy puts more responsibility on participants.</p>\n\n<p>This was done in Checkoslovakia, there was a kind of a silent pact between power and population, the message was &quot;Leave us the power, don&#39;t mess with us, and we guarantee you a relatively safe life, employment, private pleasures, private niche etc.&quot; We have a corrupted nature of happiness. Happiness should be treated as a by-product, if you work for it you will not get it. <span style=\"color:#8e44ad;\"><em>[Again this is what old wisdom tells us, I don&#39;t understand why we have been keen to avoid ancient wisdom and create layers upon layers only to create new problems.]</em></span></p>\n\n<p>We are subject to forces within us, that aren&#39;t in our voluntary control (psycho-analysis suggests that). You can&#39;t will yourself to be happy, it just happens. Somehow you happen to be in the right place at the right time, and this minor miracle happens.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>We know ecological problems, but we don&#39;t really take them seriously. We are growing protests and so on.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>We can never underestimate the evil inside us. Once a God-like figure came to a farmer and said what do you want, I can do anything, just that I will do that with your neighbour twice as much as I do to you. The farmer said - Fine, take one of my eyes. <span style=\"color:#8e44ad;\"><em>[Again, evil is present, maybe even more powerful, but the true power of humans is the ability to overcome it, and that&#39;s also present in (probably) everyone]</em></span></p>\n\n<p>Philosophy can grasp the social order when it&#39;s already in its decay, it cannot see into the future. <span style=\"color:#8e44ad;\"><em>[But it can try to enlist all (or most) the possible paths into the future. Although I&#39;m not very fond of human wisdom.]</em></span></p>\n\n<p>Even if we were somehow able to eliminate economic hierarchies, there would be other forms of hierarchies (and contentions) for example in terms of attractiveness which has little to do with economics. <span style=\"color:#8e44ad;\"><em>[Attractiveness doesn&#39;t remain a good example nowadays. MOSTLY, you will find rich people more attractive now, even though that attractiveness is fake. But still this point is to be taken seriously.]</em></span></p>\n\n<h2>How can we be truly happy then?</h2>\n\n<p>It lies in meaning, self-redemption, acting in such a way that it is not only good for yourself&nbsp;but also good in a larger context, good for society. Responsibility is not only to do what you believe is right, you cannot stay within confines of your ethical beliefs, you have to be on edge of what you know, and encounter continually the consequences of your ignorance to expand your domain of knowledge and ability. Psychological and neuropsychological evidence suggests that, that&#39;s when true happiness descends upon you&nbsp;because it&#39;s an indication from the deepest recesses of your psyche, that you are in the right place at the right time, you are doing what you should be doing, but also expanding your capacity to do better things in the future.</p>\n\n<p>Suppose you have a perfectly good life, you suddenly fall in passionate love, in some sense it is a catastrophe, you lost all the balance in your life. But ultimately you gain true happiness in that.&nbsp;Happiness is not some blissful&nbsp;unity with the highest value, it&#39;s the very struggle, the fall <em>[as in case of falling in love]</em>.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Why focus on individual development&nbsp;first, what about society, you say we need to clean our own house first before sorting the society, but what if you realize that your house is in this state particularly because of the state <span style=\"color:#8e44ad;\"><em>[and what guarantees that your house will not get in another mess, if the society is not sorted]</em>.&nbsp;</span></p>\n\n<p>When you deal with ecology, they say, &quot;what did you do for it, did you separate coke cans, and so on...&quot;, yes we should all do this. But it&#39;s also a very easy way to discard yourself of greater responsibility. You say, &quot;okay, I did my part, recycling, did my duty, why to bother now&quot;.</p>\n\n<p>Even Jesus, at the time of the crucifixion, felt alienated from God. <span style=\"color:#8e44ad;\"><em>[Don&#39;t know about Jesus, but many people did including Mother Teressa or so I&#39;ve read about her].&nbsp;</em></span></p>\n\n<p>We have clinical evidence that one of the best ways to work towards a solution is some sort of map from where the things aren&#39;t good to where the things are better. Exposure therapy works for self-redemption. The light that you discover in your life is proportional to the amount of the darkness that you are willing to forthrightly confront, and there is no necessary limit to that. The good that people are capable of is more than the evil they are capable of. If you take a personal problem seriously enough, you will simultaneously solve a social problem.<br />\n<span style=\"color:#8e44ad;\"><em>[<br />\nWe have to start somewhere! And it&#39;s quite well-known that solving the problem at a smaller level, and then take the incremental approach is more efficient, even if it takes longer.<br />\n]</em></span></p>\n\n<p>Of course, we are not immune to social problems, but personal problems might reflect a micro-version of a larger social problem, and while trying to solve it, you might get an insight into the larger problem, which is helpful. Also, you face the direct consequence of the steps you take to solve this problem, so you are more cautious and efficient. For example, the tension between male and female in the west (as evident by divorce rates, and the later phases of life people are willing to enter into a permanent relationship), you face a micro-version of it in your personal relationship.</p>\n\n<p>You do not fall from good, you fall and retrospectively construct what you fell from as good. <span style=\"color:#8e44ad;\"><em>[Age old question: Is there objective good? objective truth? Most often people say, there&#39;s not. Even though most of them&nbsp;would agree that it would be bad/wrong if someone murdered them.]</em></span></p>\n\n<p>We think that we are free, permissive, and so on, but secretly we are dominated by an entire structure of prohibitions and so on. We are told that we are living in a permissive time, take your pleasure, enjoy it, but at the same time, clinicians are telling that there are more cases of frigidity and impotence.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Neils Bohr lived outside of Copenhagen, he had a superstitious horseshoe (to prevent evil spirits and all that) on his door, once a friend asked him &quot;Do you believe in it?&quot;. He said, &quot;of course not, I am a scientist&quot;. &quot;Then why do you&nbsp;have it there?&quot; &quot;Because I was told that it works even if I don&#39;t believe in it&quot;. <span style=\"color:#8e44ad;\"><em>[That&#39;s what enlightenment in east aims at, removing the very need for this deep-rooted fear, ideologies. But, in pursuit of this, you will definitely lose the normal way of life. But it is also not wise to even hope for a paranormal fearlessness, freedom while otherwise leading a normal life. If you are going to live a normal life, you have to deal with these bondages. But even being aware of&nbsp;these sort of bondage&nbsp;is better, that&#39;s what I like about philosophers. But philosophers should also keep in mind that, just being aware, does not prevent them from falling prey to these bondages]</em></span></p>\n\n<p>People do many things which they deep inside know that it&#39;s wrong, they do it anyway. Example, you pursue hedonic pleasure that will harm you in future. Trying to stop it, that&#39;s part of the process to&nbsp;self-redemption.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heinrich_Himmler\" target=\"_blank\">Heinrich Himmler</a> (a horrible guy) said, &quot;Any idiot can sacrifice himself for his country, but it takes a truly great man to be ready to lose his soul and do horrible things for his country&quot; He used to carry a translation of Bhagavata Gita with him. How to make Nazis do horrible things without themselves being horrible beings? His solution was oriental wisdom. Zen Buddhists provided support and justification for the expansion of Japan into&nbsp;China <em>[which was a horrible event]</em>.<br />\n<span style=\"color:#8e44ad;\"><em>[<br />\nAgain, everything corrupts. Every religion, ideology, institution has. But I doubt Buddhism has any such message. As per a story, Buddha wasn&#39;t even sure he should teach his way to enlightenment to others. He doubted that people will not understand, or it will get corrupted. Also, as per stories many a time, there were people who thought Buddha was a rogue, he never bothered to go to them to argue. He knew not everyone will understand the truth even if they were told the truth. In short, he was never interested in the expansion of his ideas, although he was interested in the welfare of people. So, this expansion thing of Buddhism is nowhere justified.<br />\n]</em></span></p>\n\n<p>If my officer orders me to kill you, stab you with a knife and if I remain in this illusionary self, then I feel I killed you, I am responsible. But if I get enlightened by Zen Buddhism, then I know there is no substantial reality, you just become a neutral observer, life is just a phenomenon, and it&#39;s not that I killed you, but in the cosmic dance of phenomena, my knife is floating and somehow my knife falls on you and kills you. <em><span style=\"color:#8e44ad;\">[People have banalized this concept of enlightenment, Enlightenment is the highest state. And we doubt that someone was able to attain this state. If you get enlightened you won&#39;t even feel any force that could make you take orders from anyone, you would be fearless. Also, you would be so much compassionate to even become the&nbsp;cause of this event in this cosmic drama. This is not conducive to our rationality.&nbsp;I think madness and stupidity are&nbsp;taken as enlightenment here in the even of stabbing a knife and considering it a cosmic dance. I know it&#39;s a joke, but the sad part is the possibility that it was/is considered truth by some]</span></em></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<hr />\n<h2>CAPITALISM</h2>\n\n<p>Characterisitcs: private property, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capital_accumulation\" title=\"Capital accumulation\">capital accumulation</a>, <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wage_labor\" title=\"Wage labor\">wage labor</a>, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voluntary_exchange\" title=\"Voluntary exchange\">voluntary exchange</a>, a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Price_system\" title=\"Price system\">price system</a> and <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Competitive_market\" title=\"Competitive market\">competitive markets</a>.</p>\n\n<p>In a capitalist <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_economy\" title=\"Market economy\">market economy</a>, decision-making and investments are determined by every owner of wealth, property or production ability in <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_market\" title=\"Financial market\">financial</a> and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capital_market\" title=\"Capital market\">capital markets</a>, whereas prices and the distribution of goods and services are mainly determined by competition in goods and services markets.</p>\n\n<p>Forms of Capitalism: <i><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laissez-faire\" title=\"Laissez-faire\">laissez-faire</a></i> or <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free-market\" title=\"Free-market\">free-market</a> capitalism, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Welfare_capitalism\" title=\"Welfare capitalism\">welfare capitalism</a> and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_capitalism\" title=\"State capitalism\">state capitalism</a>.</p>\n\n<p>If you take away the half of the wealth of eighty richest people, they would still be the richest, but a lot of world&#39;s problems could be be potentially solved.</p>\n\n<p>Masters-Slaves, Lords-Peasants, Employers-Employee</p>\n\n<p>Capitalism link with Democracy, Freedom, Work</p>\n\n<p>(New) Socialism seeks to democratize the workplace.</p>\n\n<p>Too much power in too few hands.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n","authorId":null,"subject":"philosophy","tags":["basic","intro"],"img":null,"summary":"Extract from debate between Jordan Peterson and Slavoj Zizek.
