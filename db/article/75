{"name":"Writing Real / Logical Programs","id":75,"content":"<h2><span style=\"font-family:Georgia,serif;\">What is logic ?</span></h2>\n\n<p>Logic (reasoning) implies Predicates and Inference. <strong><em>Mostly if this, then that kind of situations</em></strong>. Logical statements may include some keywords like <strong>if, then, else, any, and, all, or, not ...&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n<p><font face=\"Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif\">Each programming language has its own way to express these logical statements.</font></p>\n\n<h2><font face=\"Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif\">How does Java express these logical statements ?</font></h2>\n\n<p>Java language has defined a grammar for these logical statements. The logical words that Java provides if, else, while, for, &amp; (and), || (or)</p>\n\n<p>Other logical clauses like any, all, none can be implemented using these existing logical words.</p>\n\n<p>Suppose you are writing code for a Robot which should say <strong>&quot;Hello sir&quot;</strong> if the person&#39;s age is above 18, otherwise it should say <strong>&quot;Hello kid&quot;</strong>. Suppose the Robot has detected the correct age of person somehow, now following method can be used by Robot to handle this simple logic.</p>\n\n<pre>\n<code class=\"language-java\">void sayHelloBasedOnAge(int age){\n   if(age &gt;= 20) { System.out.println(\"Hello Sir!\"); }\n   else {\n      System.out.println(\"Hello kid!\");\n   }\n}</code></pre>\n\n<p><br />\nLogic in Java is written by using these</p>\n\n<p>keywords: if, else, while, for, do<br />\noperators: &amp;&amp; (AND), || (OR), ! (NOT), == (EQUALS TO), != (DOESN&#39;T EQUAL TO), ?: (Ternary operator; just another way of writing if,else )</p>\n\n<p>These can be used to write any logical situation:</p>\n\n<pre>\n<code class=\"language-java\">//Do something forever; suppose that something will be done by method something()\ndo{ something(); } while(true);\n\n//Or\nwhile(true){ something(); }\n\n//Do something while some condition is true\nwhile(conditionIsTrue(....)){ something(); }\n\nboolean conditionIsTrue(....){  \n   boolean isTrue = false; \n       ...  //change the value of isTrue by using if, else or however possible\n       ...   \n   return isTrue; \n}</code></pre>\n\n<p><br />\nSuppose a robot wants to count from one to ten.</p>\n\n<pre>\n<code class=\"language-java\">int currentCount = 1;\nwhile(currentCount &lt; 11){\n   System.out.println(currentCount);\n   currentCount += 1;\n}\n\n//Or\nint currentCount = 1;\nwhile(currentCount &lt;= 10){\n   System.out.println(currentCount);\n   currentCount += 1;\n}\n\n//Or\nfor(int currentCount=1; currentCount &lt; 11; currentCount += 1){\n   System.out.println(currentCount);\n}\n\n//If you are thinking that why can't we say something like this, and Java will understand\n// From 1 to 10; print it\n\n//We can say something similar, but not if you are using a Java with version less than 1.8\nrange(1,11).forEach(System.out::println); // Do not forget to add this line on top of file\n                                          // import static java.util.stream.IntStream.range;\n\n\n</code></pre>\n\n<p><br />\nYou see there are two words doing same thing (<strong>for, while)</strong>&nbsp;but we have to tell them in different ways. These are called <strong>while-loop </strong>and<strong> for-loop .</strong></p>\n\n<h2>&nbsp;</h2>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n","authorId":null,"subject":"linked-to-132","tags":["basic"],"img":null,"summary":null,"lastUpdated":"2018-07-01T13:59:23.151+0000"}
