General Philosophy - Anything* (more precisely, the answers to any properly formatted questions) can be represented as computation.<br />\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;2. Mathematical Philosophy - Any function (and hence any computation) can be represented in form of some polynomial equation.</p>\n\n<p>Science of Machine Learning:<br />\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The science of machine learning involves scientific tools such as mathematics of functions, calculas, linear algebra, statistics.<br />\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Function represents the computation which gives the answer to the desired question.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Linear Algebra helps us represent a function in a way which can be easily be worked upon.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Calculas gives us some tricks which allows us to get the &quot;Correct&quot; form of the function which can give correct answers.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Statistics helps in both in telling us what should be a good form of the desired function and how to find that function.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Scientific&quot; procedure:<br />\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;1. You need some data for which you already know the correct answer.&nbsp;<br />\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;2. Choose a random function.<br />\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;3. Apply this function to the data that you have. The function that you currently have will give random results some of which might be correct.&nbsp;<br />\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;4. Calculate how far you are off from the correct results for the data that you have.<br />\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;5. If you are getting &quot;satisfactorily correct answers&quot;, you are done.<br />\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;6. Modify the function a little.<br />\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;7. Go to step 3.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Where is the science here?<br />\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;1. In knowing how to choose that random function? (Statistics?)<br />\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;2. In knowing how to calculate how far you are off from the correct answers. (Statistics?)<br />\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;3. In knowing how to modify the function a little. (Calculas)<br />\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;4. In knowing whether the function will ever get to a satisfactory form. (Calculas)</p>\n\n<p>Engineering:<br />\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The engineering part here is (as always) tightly coupled with Science and experience.&nbsp;<br />\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;1. Deciding the shape of the function.<br />\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;2. How much to change in the function.<br />\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;3. When do you know that you are going in the right direction.<br />\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;4. How to execute this procedure and get things done.</p>\n\n<p>Let&#39;s execute this scientific procedure:<br />\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;1. Frame the question<br />\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;2. Collect the data</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Do this in order 1,2 or 2,1. Both orders will have their own impications.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Let&#39;s say the question is:<br />\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;What will be the price of my house after 10 years?&quot;<br />\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;What will be the data that you need to collect?<br />\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;- One data that is compulsory is this: the price of houses in past.<br />\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;- Price of which houses?<br />\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;- Maybe all houses in your locality.<br />\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;- Or, all the houses in your city, district, state or whatever.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The other things/data that you need to collect are the about the factors which affect the price of houses?<br />\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;What are those things/factors?<br />\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;- Who knows; Everythig is connected. It could be the distance from industries, it could be the climate, it could be the the area covered by houses, it could be economic status of the locality, it could be the number of influential people living around there, ....&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Which factors should you take seriously?<br />\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;- That&#39;s where engineering comes - the combination of experience and science (basically statistics).</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Let&#39;s say we choose the main factor that determines the price to be &quot;Area covered by the house&quot; and &quot;how old is the house&quot;.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Now, the question is:<br />\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;What will be the price of my house after 10 years?<br />\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;And, we have data of the houses from the past i.e. their area/size.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Let&#39;s say the function that we choose randomly is:<br />\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;price = ax + b; where a = size of the house, b = some number.<br />\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;How did we choose this function?&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;What will be the value of a and b?<br />\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;- We will determine that using our scientific procedure.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Let&#39;s apply this function to the size of houses that we have and compute the price.<br />\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;...<br />\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;..<br />\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Let&#39;s calculate how far this function is off from the &quot;correct&quot; function:<br />\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;We have a statistical tool for that.<br />\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;That&#39;s called Mean Squared Error. This is not the only way, but a good way.<br />\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Calculate the error of computation for each house -&gt; Square them -&gt; Sum them -&gt; Find the average of them.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Let&#39;s find out whether the function is good enough:<br />\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;If the error is negligible, then it&#39;s OK.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Let&#39;s modify the function a little:<br />\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;We have a mathematical tool for that: Calculas. (Actually we have many tools: see book - Linear and Nonlinear Optimization)<br />\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Using this tool, you can find out the values that will give minimum or maximum value for a given function.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;We know the error-function - Mean Squared Error.<br />\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;And we want that to be minimum (if that&#39;s possible)</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Let&#39;s use calculas for that.<br />\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;J = (1/m)*Sigma_1^m (y - (ax+b))^2</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The calculas says that if you apply &#39;derivative&#39; to a function and it gives you negative value, then you are most probably going in the right direction to find out the minimum value of the function.<br />\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The calculas also gives a way to directly find out what will be the values that will give the minimum value of the function, we will see that later.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Let&#39;s find the derivative of our error function.<br />\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Derivative with respect to what? - a and b; because that&#39;s what we will be modifying to get to the correct function.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Find derivatice w.r.t. a and modify a<br />\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Find derivatice w.r.t. b and modify b</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;We can control how much change we want to make by multiplying the values of derivatives with some number.<br />\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;This number controls how fast we are making changes to reach to the correct function.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n","authorId":null,"subject":"hidden","tags":["learning"],"img":null,"summary":null,"lastUpdated":null}
