Is it just something that can be perceived by our sensory mechanism? It is to be noted that our sensory apparatus takes the data in various forms and creates image in our mind and by virtue of the fact that it can create the same images when the actual thing is not there (e.g. in <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dream\" target=\"_blank\">dream</a>, during <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hallucination\" target=\"_blank\">hallucination</a>), it is not illogical to doubt the existence of things outside our minds. Maybe there exists <em>something</em>, but it may not be the same as what we perceive.</p>\n\n<p>Traditional philosophies have said this in many places that &quot;Reality does not exist, it flows, and beings are an illusion upon the flow&quot;.&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parmenides\" title=\"Parmenides\">Parmenides</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heraclitus\" title=\"\">Heraclitus</a>, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samkhya\" target=\"_blank\">Hindu Samkhya philosophy</a></p>\n\n<p>What is&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Existence\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Existence\">existence</a>, i.e. what does it mean for a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Being\" target=\"_blank\">being</a> to be?&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>What are the fundamental entities for the whole existence?&nbsp;How far can we go in finding a common part among beings (just the perceived beings for simplicity)? What is common among <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elementary_particle\" target=\"_blank\">fundamental particles</a>?</p>\n\n<p>What are the categories of the things that <em>exist</em>? What are the fundamentals for existence as far as our minds and understanding are concerned?</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>What forms the identity of an entity?&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ship_of_Theseus\" target=\"_blank\">Ship_of_Theseus</a></p>\n\n<p>If abstract ideas don&#39;t exist, how can <em>Self</em> exist? Self is also something imperceivable. (Associative connection between life episodes is necessary and sufficient for the maintenance of a united selfhood. Personal character and memories can persist after radical mutation of the body. - <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kant\" title=\"Kant\">Kant</a>)</p>\n\n<p>Everything exists in some model e.g. for a mathematician triangle exists, not in the same way as physical bodies exist, but within a mathematical model of the world. Then what is the model containing everything? Can there be a model without conscious being?</p>\n\n<p>Is it that &#39;what exists&#39; is wrong question?</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Some ideas regarding being and existence (Source: wikipedia etc):</p>\n\n<ol id=\"list1\">\n\t<li><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Materialism\" title=\"Materialism\">Materialism</a>&nbsp;there is nothing that is not either <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matter\" title=\"Matter\">matter</a> or <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energy\" title=\"\">energy</a>.

It can also represent an existential angst. In both these cases, it is not possible to satisfy with an answer. This question then is an expression of emotion/feeling rather than a typical question.</p>\n\n<p>If the &quot;why&quot; in this question demands a purpose, then there is no logical, scientific answer as Science can just observe, record, calculate, predict phenomena, it cannot assign any meaning. It can sometimes assign some meaning in a particular framework or context e.g. it can answer why regarding some behaviors of animals (including humans) in terms of evolutionary purpose, but on a larger scale it cannot give any meaning or purpose.</p>\n\n<p>If the &quot;why&quot; in this question is concerned about &quot;how come&quot;, about the causes, processes then cosmology and physics has some answers.</p>\n\n<hr />\n<p><br />\nIf we map this to mathematical concepts<br />\nWhat do we observe? What has science observed?<br />\n&nbsp;{x,y,z}<br />\n&nbsp;If {x,y,z} is possible then so is {x,y}, {x}, {y}<br />\n&nbsp;And so is {} EMPTY</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;But if there are infinite such possibilities, then the PROBABILITY of {} is 1/Infinity which is zero, so is the probability of any other sets.<br />\n&nbsp;But the probability of a set with at least something is 1-prob({}) &rArr;&nbsp;1-0 &rArr;&nbsp;1</p>\n\n<p>So, mathematically there has to exist something.</p>\n\n<hr />\n<p>If we consider all our observations;<br />\n&nbsp; it is not possible to make anything from nothing.<br />\n&nbsp; Things just transform; If you consider energy to be a thing, the universe or multiverse came from energies. <em>(Where did that energy come from? - We don&#39;t know. Maybe some other energy/matter..)</em></p>\n\n<hr />\n<p>This question is simply unanswerable, because any explanation would require some entity (abstract or real) which will be considered &#39;something&#39;</p>\n\n<hr />\n<p>Can nothing exist without something? How would you even start to imagine this?<br />\n&nbsp;Can darkness exist without light? Can holes exist without a solid?<br />\n&nbsp;You say these are not concrete entities. Then how would you first define concrete entities?</p>\n\n<hr />\n<p>Everything exists in Space and Time, so a contained question is &quot;Why is there Space and Time?&quot;</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>What does a man love more than life?<br />\nHate more than death or mortal strife?<br />\nThat which contented men desire,<br />\nThe poor have, the rich require,<br />\nThe miser spends, the spendthrift saves,<br />\nAnd all men carry to their graves?</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (Leeming, 1953, 201)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>&nbsp;The answer to the above is &quot;Nothing&quot;.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n","authorId":null,"subject":"philosophy","tags":null,"img":"/images/web.jpg","summary":"","lastUpdated":"2020-03-29T18:20:42.251+0000"}
