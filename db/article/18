Earlier the only option for Adidas was to do it based on Loan, but Loans are something that nobody wants. So, Klarna comes in and says, &quot;let me hand over the loan, and in return you pay some small money (some percent of order value + some fixed fee) to us&quot;. Adidas would accept it because - maybe they don&#39;t have capacity/intent to handle the loans, outsourcing the Loan management is more profitable for them.</p>\n\n<p>Klarna gives loan to the customer at some cost - fees, interest.</p>\n\n<p>Adidas would also be willing to pay some money for the traffic generated by Klarna.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h1>Financial Markets:</h1>\n\n<p>WHAT, WHY, WHEN, HOW</p>\n\n<p>Where buyers and sellers participate in Trading of assets [ equities, bonds, currencies and derivatives ].<br />\nCapital Markets :- Companies and Govt tries to raise Capital (or Funds) by selling Securities (Stocks and Bonds).<br />\n&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;There are Bond Markets and Stock Markets.</p>\n\n<p>Money Markets :- Where Financial Instruments with high liquidity and short maturity are traded [egotiable&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/certificateofdeposit.asp\"><strong>certificates of deposit</strong></a>&nbsp;(CDs), banker&#39;s acceptances, U.S. Treasury bills, commercial paper, municipal notes, eurodollars, federal funds and repurchase agreements (repos)].</p>\n\n<p>Cash or Spot Market :- Where the goods (commodities and securities) are sold for cash and are immediately delivered.<br />\n<br />\nDerivative Market :- Common derivatives are Options, Forwards, Futures, Swaps and Contracts-For-Difference.</p>\n\n<p>Forex and Inter-bank Markets :- Where banks and large financial institutions participate in trading specially currencies.</p>\n\n<p>Over-The-Counter (OTC) Market :- A.k.a. Dealer Market. OTC refers to Stocks that are not trading on Stock Exchanges.</p>\n\n<p>Terms:</p>\n\n<p>Liquid Asset: An asset which can be converted into cash quickly with minimal impact to price received in Open Market. These &nbsp;include Money market instruments and Govt&nbsp;bonds.<br />\nLiquidity describes the degree to which an&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/asset.asp\">asset</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/security.asp\">security</a>&nbsp;can be quickly bought or sold in the market without affecting the asset&#39;s price.</p>\n\n<h2>Bonds:</h2>\n\n<p>Bond :- Corporations issue bonds to borrow money from investors, giving extra in form of interest payments at regular intervals (interest rate is called Coupon) and giving original amount ( face value ) at predetermined time called maturity date.<br />\nBonds versus Equity :- Bonds are debts while Stocks are Equities. Bonds have lower risk associated than equities, but at the cost of lower return.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;Govt Bonds: Bills , Notes and Bonds. Bills have maturity less than a year. Notes have maturity one to ten years. Bonds have more than ten years.<br />\n&nbsp;Corporate Bonds: Convertible bonds, Callable bonds. In Convertible bonds investor can convert bond to stock. In Callable bond, company can issue before maturity.</p>\n\n<p>Factors considering for Bonds: Maturity, Yield To Maturity, Coupon, Discount, Issuer&#39;s Credit record.</p>\n\n<p>Bond prices are quoted as a percentage of the face value of the bond, based on $100. For example, if a bond is selling at 95, it means that the bond may be purchased for 95% of its face value; a $10,000 bond, therefore, would cost the investor $9,500.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Types are Treasury Bills, Notes and Bonds. T-Bills have maturity of one or less year.</p>\n\n<p>Bond Terminology:&nbsp;<br />\nFace Value / Par Value: The value at which interest is paid.<br />\nMarket Price: On par value.<br />\nCoupon: Interest rate paid on par value.<br />\nYield: Amount of return investor gets on a bond. Nominal Yield: Coupon divided by Face Value<br />\n&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Current Yield: Annual earnings of bond divided by current market price.<br />\nBond Price may be listed using convention handle+ n/32. So&nbsp;102-04 means (102+4/32)% of par value. Treasuries may be in n/64 format. Generally handle is known and hence omitted.</p>\n\n<p>If YieldToMaturity is higher than Coupon, then you will effectively get more than what you could get with just coupons. How, by compounding the return, reinvest the coupon. YTM takes into factor many things, such as Compounding, Discount/Premium (diff b/w price&nbsp; and face value) etc.If YieldToMaturity is higher than Coupon, then you will effectively get more than what you could get with just coupons. How, by compounding the return, reinvest the coupon. YTM takes into factor many things, such as Compounding, Discount/Premium (diff b/w price&nbsp; and face value) etc.</p>\n\n<p>Risks associated with Bonds:</p>\n\n<p>Company or Govt&rsquo;s failure to give coupon, in that case you would sell bond at much lower rate.<br />\nThings are tricky when you do not hold bond till maturity, instead you try to sell in between.</p>\n\n<h2>&nbsp;Stocks:</h2>\n\n<p>1 Share is equivalent to 1 small business.<br />\nVolume (Volume of Trade): Number of shares traded in given time period. 1 large business is divided into multiple shares.<br />\nHigher volumes &nbsp;means&nbsp;more liquidity, more active market.</p>\n\n<p>3 types of account sheets of company/ business.</p>\n\n<p>Income Statement, Balance Sheet, Cash Flow Statement</p>\n\n<p><strong>Income Statement</strong></p>\n\n<p>Revenue: The money that business receives from it&rsquo;s customers.<br />\nGross, Operating and Net (GON)&nbsp;Income/Profit<br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Gross Profit / Sales Profit: &ldquo;Total Revenue&rdquo; minus &ldquo;Cost of Goods Sold (COGS)&rdquo;.
