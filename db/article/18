Dealer Market. OTC refers to Stocks that are not trading on Stock Exchanges.</p><p>Terms:</p><p>Liquid Asset: An asset which can be converted into cash quickly with minimal impact to price received in Open Market. These &nbsp;include Money market instruments and Govt&nbsp;bonds.<br />Liquidity describes the degree to which an&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/asset.asp\">asset</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/security.asp\">security</a>&nbsp;can be quickly bought or sold in the market without affecting the asset's price.</p><h2>Bonds:</h2><p>Bond :- Corporations issue bonds to borrow money from investors, giving extra in form of interest payments at regular intervals (interest rate is called Coupon) and giving original amount ( face value ) at predetermined time called maturity date.<br />Bonds versus Equity :- Bonds are debts while Stocks are Equities. Bonds have lower risk associated than equities, but at the cost of lower return.</p><p>&nbsp;Govt Bonds: Bills , Notes and Bonds. Bills have maturity less than a year. Notes have maturity one to ten years. Bonds have more than ten years.<br />&nbsp;Corporate Bonds: Convertible bonds, Callable bonds. In Convertible bonds investor can convert bond to stock. In Callable bond, company can issue before maturity.</p><p>Factors considering for Bonds: Maturity, Yield To Maturity, Coupon, Discount, Issuer's Credit record.</p><p>Bond prices are quoted as a percentage of the face value of the bond, based on $100. For example, if a bond is selling at 95, it means that the bond may be purchased for 95% of its face value; a $10,000 bond, therefore, would cost the investor $9,500.&nbsp;</p><p>Types are Treasury Bills, Notes and Bonds. T-Bills have maturity of one or less year.</p><p>Bond Terminology:&nbsp;<br />Face Value / Par Value: The value at which interest is paid.<br />Market Price: On par value.<br />Coupon: Interest rate paid on par value.<br />Yield: Amount of return investor gets on a bond. Nominal Yield: Coupon divided by Face Value<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Current Yield: Annual earnings of bond divided by current market price.<br />Bond Price may be listed using convention handle+ n/32. So&nbsp;102-04 means (102+4/32)% of par value. Treasuries may be in n/64 format. Generally handle is known and hence omitted.</p><p>If YieldToMaturity is higher than Coupon, then you will effectively get more than what you could get with just coupons. How, by compounding the return, reinvest the coupon. YTM takes into factor many things, such as Compounding, Discount/Premium (diff b/w price&nbsp; and face value) etc.If YieldToMaturity is higher than Coupon, then you will effectively get more than what you could get with just coupons. How, by compounding the return, reinvest the coupon. YTM takes into factor many things, such as Compounding, Discount/Premium (diff b/w price&nbsp; and face value) etc.</p><p>Risks associated with Bonds:</p><p>Company or Govt’s failure to give coupon, in that case you would sell bond at much lower rate.<br />Things are tricky when you do not hold bond till maturity, instead you try to sell in between.</p><h2>&nbsp;Stocks:</h2><p>1 Share is equivalent to 1 small business.<br />Volume (Volume of Trade): Number of shares traded in given time period. 1 large business is divided into multiple shares.<br />Higher volumes &nbsp;means&nbsp;more liquidity, more active market.</p><p>3 types of account sheets of company/ business.</p><p>Income Statement, Balance Sheet, Cash Flow Statement</p><p><strong>Income Statement</strong></p><p>Revenue: The money that business receives from it’s customers.<br />Gross, Operating and Net (GON)&nbsp;Income/Profit<br /> </p><p>Gross Profit / Sales Profit: “Total Revenue” minus “Cost of Goods Sold (COGS)”.
