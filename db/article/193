{"name":"Plato's Theaetetus","id":193,"content":"<p><em>The following is an extract from Plato&#39;s book &quot;Theatetus&quot;. This is a dialogue between Socrates and Theatetus. My comments are in [] brackets.</em></p>\n\n<p>The structure of the arguments made in this book:</p>\n\n<div style=\"color: green; padding-left: 2%; border-left: 1px solid blue;\">\n<p>What is knowledge?</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp; ⌞ X, Y, Z</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;⌞⌞ But they are examples of knowledge, not the definition of it.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;⌞ Knowledge is perception</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;⌞⌞ But perception is different for different men. And perception can be erring. E.g. a doctor might have knowledge of disease, whether other people can have erring perception. It seems to them, but they don&#39;t know.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;⌞⌞ If thousands agree with you one something and hundreds don&#39;t, does that mean your perception and hence knowledge is more truer than others?</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;⌞ Knowledge is true opinion</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;⌞⌞ What is false opinion? Can we know false opinion without having knowledge? Then how come we will know what is true opinion without having knowledge?</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;⌞⌞ Judges make judgements based on opinion, and even if this comes out to be true opinion, they do not actually know, they do not have knowledge. So true knowledge and knowledge must be different.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp; ⌞ True opinion, combined with reason, is knowledge. The opinion which has no reason is out of the sphere of knowledge, and the things of which there are no rational account are not knowable.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ⌞ ⌞ Seems good. But let&#39;s take the example of knowing letters and syllables. Through rational exercise a person knows syllables and can define them, but what about letters, can we define letters, they are just mere signs, noises. How can it be possible that we do not know the elements and know the syllables formed by these elements?</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;⌞ ⌞ Suppose I have true opinion of you, and if to this I add your definition, then I have knowledge, otherwise opinion only.&nbsp;&nbsp;If I have right opinion about you I would recall you when I see you tomorrow, then I already must have something that makes you different from everyone else. Then right opinion implies the perception of differences.&nbsp;And, so when the&nbsp;question is asked, What is knowledge? this fair argument will answer &#39;Right opinion with knowledge (knowledge of difference)&#39;. [But this is circular] and utterly foolish.</p>\n</div>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<hr />\n<p>Socrates: Are not men wise in that which they know?</p>\n\n<p>Theaetetus: Certainly they are.</p>\n\n<p>S: Then wisdom and knowledge are the same? <span style=\"color:#8e44ad;\"><em>[Is this a right deduction, logically? Knowledge can be subject-specific, but is wisdom also subject specific?]</em></span></p>\n\n<p>T: Yes.</p>\n\n<p>S: But..what is knowledge?</p>\n\n<p>T: The sciences like geometry and arts of craftsmen, cobbler, etc. are all,&nbsp;knowledge.</p>\n\n<p>S: Too many...So if someone asks &#39;what is clay?&#39; and we were to reply, that there is a clay of potters, there is a clay of oven-makers, there is a clay of brick-makers; would not the answer be ridiculous.</p>\n\n<p>T: Truly. I got your point. Just another day we learned to classify numbers in two classes based on their properties while finding their roots. You want something similar. But I am unable to provide a similar answer for knowledge. So,&nbsp; Theoderus&nbsp;is a deceiver after all [in telling you that I am bright].</p>\n\n<p>S: Well, but if someone were to praise you for running, and to say that he never your equal among boys, and afterwards&nbsp;you were beaten in a race by a grown-up man, who was a great runner - would the praise be any less true?<br />\n<span style=\"color:#8e44ad;\"><em>[Socrates tries to encourage Theaetetus]</em></span></p>\n\n<p>T: Certainly not.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>S: And is the discovery of the nature of knowledge so small a matter, as just now said? Is it not which would require the powers of men perfect in every way?</p>\n\n<p>S: Try your best with the knowledge, the same way you did to find roots and classify numbers.</p>\n\n<p>T: I have tried very often, when the report of questions asked by you was brought to me; but I can neither persuade myself that I have a satisfactory answer to give, nor hear of any one who answers as you would have him; and I cannot shake off a feeling of anxiety.</p>\n\n<p>S: <span style=\"color:#8e44ad;\">These are the pangs of </span><span style=\"color:#8e44ad;\">labour</span><span style=\"color:#8e44ad;\">, my dear Theaetetus; you have something within you which you are bringing to the birth.&nbsp;</span><em>[Here Socrates tells Theaetetus that just as midwives attend to women to give birth to child, he attends to men&#39;s soul when they are in </em><em>labour</em><em>, and just like midwives are normally those who have lost ability to bear child, he too is barren, that is he does not know answers to questions he asks, but those who converse with him </em><em>do</em><em> get something, not from him, but from themselves. Also, like midwives are good matchmakers, he too points people to great sages. Socrates encourages Theaetetus to make some effort in answering; and also tells him not to be discouraged if Socrates refutes him because just like a midwife he can tell between true birth and a mere wind-egg]</em>.</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#8e44ad;\"><em>[I included these lines in the summary just to show that Theaetetus was an avid learner, with a bit of scepticism, and that Socrates did not ever assert any statement, rather asked questions to verify his statement. ]</em></span></p>\n\n<p>T: At any rate, Socrates, after such an exhortation I should be ashamed of not trying to do my best. Now he who knows perceives what he knows, and, as far as I can see at present, knowledge is perception.</p>\n\n<p>S: Bravely said boy, that is the way in which you should express your opinion... Your opinion of knowledge is indeed the same as that of Protagoras when he says &quot;<strong>Man is the measure of all things, of the existence of things that are and of the non-existence of things that are not.</strong>&quot;... Now if you say that the wind is cold, and I say that the wind is not, then the wind regarded absolutely, not in relation to us, is cold or not? We can&#39;t say but we can ertainly say that the wind is cold to him who is cold and not to him who is not. <span style=\"color:#8e44ad;\"><em>[Is Socrates taking Protagoras&#39;s words too literally?]</em></span></p>\n\n<p>T: Quite true.</p>\n\n<p>S: Then it must appear so to each of them, and &#39;appears to him&#39; means same as &#39;he perceives&#39;. This is true for hot and cold, and similarly for other things..&nbsp;Then perception is always of existence, and being the same as knowledge is unerring? Similar to Protagoras, other philosophers like Heracleitus, Empedocles, and poets like Homer, Epicharmus, believe the same thing. There are plenty of other proofs that show that motion is the source of what is called being and becoming, and inactivity of not-being and destruction; for fire and warmth which are supposed to be the parent and guardian of all other things, are born of movement and of friction. And the race of animals is generated in the same way?<br />\n<span style=\"color:#8e44ad;\"><em>[Motion is the source of being? - Maybe, after all, we now know from modern physics that atomic and subatomic particles are always in motion!]</em></span></p>\n\n<p>T: Yes.</p>\n\n<p>S: And is not the bodily habit spoiled by rest and idleness, but preserved for a long time by motion and exercise? And what of the mental habit? Is not the soul informed, and improved, and preserved by study and attention, which are motions; but when at rest, i.e want of attention and study, is uninformed, and speedly foregts whatever she has learned. Then motion is good and rest is an evil, to the soul as well as to the body?</p>\n\n<p>T: Clearly.</p>\n\n<p>S: Now let&#39;s apply this to vision. That which you call white colour is not in your eyes, and is not a distinct thing which exists out of them. And you must not assign any place to it, for then it would be at rest, and there would be no process of becoming.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>T: Then what is colour?</p>\n\n<p>S: Let us carry the principle which has just been affirmed that nothing is self-existent, and then we shall see that white, black and every other colour arises out of the eye meeting the appropriate motion, that what we call color is in each case neither an active nor a passive element but something which passes between them. Are you quite certain that the several colours appear to a dog or to any animal whatever as they appear to you? Or that anything appears the same to you as to another man?</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#8e44ad;\"><em>[SO, REST IS EVIL, MOTION IS NECESSARY FOR BODY, SOUL&nbsp;&amp; PERCEPTIONS]</em></span></p>\n\n<p>T: Far from it.</p>\n\n<p>S: In the&nbsp;case of dreams and diseases and illusions, we have false perceptions. So far from saying that everything is which appears, we should rather say that <span style=\"color:#8e44ad;\"><strong>nothing is which appears</strong></span>. Then how can we contend that knowledge is perception, or that to every man what appears is? <span style=\"color:#8e44ad;\"><strong>How can you determine whether at this moment we are sleeping, and all our thoughts are a dream; or whether we are awake, and talking to one another in the waking state?</strong></span></p>\n\n<p>S: If Protagoras&#39;s claim is true, then why should he be the&nbsp;judge of this truth that &quot;Man is the&nbsp;measure of all things existent and non-existent&quot;?&nbsp;<br />\nWhy, suppose that you determine in your own mind something to be true, and declare your opinion to me; let us assume, as he (Protagoras) argues, that this is true to you. Now, if so, you must either say that the rest of us are not the judges of this opinion or judgment of yours, or that we judge you always to have a true opinion? But are there not thousands upon thousands who, whenever you form a judgment, take up arms against you and are of an opposite judgment and opinion, deeming that you judge falsely? So, what you think is true to you and false to the ten thousand others? So, if multitude does not agree with Protagoras, you must allow that in whatever proportion the many are more than one, in that proportion his truth is more untrue than true?</p>\n\n<p>Theodorus: That would follow if the truth is supposed to vary with individual opinion.</p>\n\n<p>S: And the best of the joke is, that he acknowledges the truth of their opinion who believe his own opinion to be false; for he (Protagoras) admits that the opinion of all men are true. <span style=\"color:#8e44ad;\"><em>[TRUTH&nbsp; CANNOT BE WHAT IS PERCEIVED BY ANYONE/EVERYONE, IT MEANS IT CANNOT BE SUBJECTIVE, AND CANNOT BE RELATIVE]</em></span></p>\n\n<p>S: Protagoras will himself allow that neither a dog nor any ordinary man is the measure of anything which he has not learned. And the truth of Protagoras being doubted by all, will be true neither to himself to any one else?</p>\n\n<p>S: One thing which no&nbsp;one will deny is that there are great differences in the understandings of men. And is there not most likely to be firm ground in the distinction which we were indicating on behalf of Protagoras, i.e. that most things, and all immediate sensations, such as hot, dry, sweet are only such as they appear; if however difference of opinion is to be allowed at all, surely we must allow it in respect of health or disease? for every woman, child, or living creature has not such a knowledge of what conduces to health as to enable them to cure themselves. Or again, in politics, while affirming that just and unjust, honourable and disgraceful, holy and unholy, are in reality to each state such as the state thinks and makes lawful, and that in determining these matters no individual or state is wiser than another, still the followers of Protagoras will not deny that in determining what is or is not expedient (convenient or practical although possibly improper) for community one state is wiser and one counseller better than another. But in another case, I mean when they speak of justice and injustice, piety and impiety, they are confident that in nature these have no existence or essence of their own - <span style=\"color:#2980b9;\"><strong>the truth is that which is agreed on at the time of the agreement, and as long as the agreement lasts;</strong></span> and this is the philosophy of many who do not altogether go along with Protagoras.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#2980b9;\"><em>[Here Socrates comments on how philosophers are different from normal people, not very much related to the topic of knowledge being discussed, but very interesting]</em></span></p>\n\n<p>[Socrates tells how philosophers are mocked giving an example of Thales, when he fell into a well as he was looking up to the stars. A Thracian&nbsp;handmaid was watching him, she said jokingly, that he was so eager to know what was going on in heaven, that he could not see what was before his feet. A philosopher is wholly unacquainted with his next-door neighbor; he is ignorant, not ony of what he is doing, but he hardly knows whether he is a man or an animal; he is searching into essence of man, and busy in enquiring what belongs to such a nature to do or suffer different from any other. When he appears in a law-court, or in any other place in which he has to speak of things which are at his feet and before his eyes, he is the jest, because of his inexperience. His awkwardness is fearful, and gives the impression of imbecility. When he hears a tyrant or king eulogized, he fancies that he is listening to the praises of some keeper of cattle, who is congratulated on the quantity of milk which he squeezes from them. Hearing of enormous landed proprietors of ten thousand acres and more, our philosopher deems this to be a trifle, because he has been accustomed to think of the whole earth; and when they sing the praises of family, and say that some one is a gentleman because he can show seven generations of wealthy ancestors, he thinks that their sentiments only betray a dull and narrow vision in those who utter them, and those who are not educated enough to look at the whole, nor to consider that every man has had thousands of progenitors, and among them have been rich and poor, kings and slaves innumerable. He thinks that a little arithmetic would have got rid of their senseless vanity. Now in all these cases, our philosopher is derided by the vulgar, partly because he is thought to despise them, and also because he is ignorant of what is before him, and always at loss. Such are the two characters: the one of the freeman, who has been trained in liberty and leisure, whom you call the philosopher, - him we cannot blame because he appears simple and of no account when he has to perform some menial task, such as packing up bed-clothes, or flavouring a sauce or fawning (flattery, affectionate) speech. Other are the men who can do these effortlessly.</p>\n\n<p>Socrates then refutes the theory of universal flux i.e. &quot;<strong>Everything is in motion</strong>&quot;.</p>\n\n<p>S: What do they mean when they say that all things are in motion? Is there only one kind of motion, or, as I rather incline to think, two? When a thing changes from one place to another, or goes round in the same place, is not that what is called motion?</p>\n\n<p>T: Yes.</p>\n\n<p>S: That is one kind of motion. But when a thing, remaining on the same spot, grows old, or becomes black from being white, or hard from being soft, or undergoes any other change, can this not be called the second kind of motion, &#39;Motion in place&#39;? - Yes</p>\n\n<p>S: So, are all things in both kinds of motion, or some in both and some in only one of them?</p>\n\n<p>T: In both I guess.</p>\n\n<p>S: Yes, otherwise they would have to say, same things are in motion and at rest, and there would be no more truth in saying that all things are in motion, than that all things are at rest.</p>\n\n<p>S: And if they white and whiteness itself is flux, act of seeing is in motion, then we must not speak of seeing any more than not-seeing, similarly for other perceptions... Then when we asked what is knowledge, we no more answered what is knowledge than what is not knowledge. That means knowledge cannot be perception. <span style=\"color:#8e44ad;\"><em>[GRANTED THAT THINGS ARE IN FLUX, BUT MAYBE THEIR CONSTITUENTS ARE IN FLUX, BUT THERE IS SOMETHING WHICH EMERGES FROM THESE MOVING CONSTITUENTS WHICH IS IMPERMANENT AS WE KNOW BUT NOT ALWAYS IN FLUX]</em></span></p>\n\n<p>Theaetetus asks Socrates to consider doctrine of <strong>&quot;Everything is one and at rest&quot;</strong>.</p>\n\n<p>S: We perceive through our faculties. The objects of sight cannot be perceived through hearing, and objects of hearing cannot be perceived through sight? But if you have any thought about both of them, thought of being, not being, likeness, unlikeness, sameness, difference, what faculty is responsible for that?</p>\n\n<p>T: The mind.</p>\n\n<p>S: So if you admit that the soul views some things by herself, and others through bodily organs; to which class would you refer being or essence?</p>\n\n<p>T: To that class which the soul aspires to know of herself.</p>\n\n<p>S: The simple sensations which reach the soul through&nbsp;the body are given at birth to men and animals by nature, but their reflections on being and use of them are slowly and hardly gained, if they are ever gained, by education and long experience. Can a man attain truth who fails of attaining being? Can he who misses the truth of anything, have a knowledge of that thing? - No.<br />\nS: Then knowledge does not consist in impressions of sense, but in reasoning about them. Impressions of sense can be called perception? <strong>Then knowledge is not the same as perception&nbsp;</strong><em><span style=\"color:#2980b9;\">[because perception is just about sensory inputs, even brutes can perceive, but do they have knowledge?]</span></em> But we wanted to find what is knowledge rather than what is not knowledge. So try once more.</p>\n\n<p>T: <strong>Knowledge is true opinion</strong>.</p>\n\n<p>S: Hmm... but there is a difficulty that troubles my mind...how there can be <strong>false opinion</strong>... When we say that a man holds a false opinion and another a true opinion, as though there were some natural distinction between them?&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/cupitor-220103.appspot.com/images/theaetetus_knowledge_falsity.png\" /></p>\n\n<p>Where then is false opinion? For all things are either known or unknown. <span style=\"color:#2980b9;\"><em>[SO, THERE CANNOT BE FALSE OPINION OF AN INDIVIDUAL UNTIL WE BRING SOMEONE ELSE&#39;S OPINION INTO PICTURE, BUT ISN&#39;T THIS WHAT RELATIVISM SAYS? - MAYBE, BUT THE DIFFERENCE IS THAT THEY ALREADY BELIEVE THAT THERE IS NO ABSOLUTE]</em></span></p>\n\n<p>S: Suppose that we remove the question out of the sphere of knowing and not knowing, into that of being and not-being.</p>\n\n<p>S: ... he who thinks anything, that which is not, will necessarily think what is false, isn&#39;t it? - Yes.<br />\nS: Is it possible for any man to think that which is not, either as a self-existent substance or as a predicate of something else? - Yes, he can, when he thinks what is not true.</p>\n\n<p>S: But is there any parallel to this? Can a man see something and yet see nothing?&nbsp; A man sees some one thing, sees something which is, hears some one thing, hears that which is... then does it not imply that a man thinks some one thing, will think of something which is? Then he who thinks of that which is not, thinks of nothing? <strong>And he who thinks of nothing, doesn&#39;t think at all? </strong><span style=\"color:#2980b9;\"><em>[Is this correct deduction, logically?]</em></span></p>\n\n<p>S: Then to think falsely is different from thinking that which is not.</p>\n\n<p>S: But we can say that false opinion is heterodoxy, a person may make an exchange in his mind and say that one real object is another real object.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>T: Like when a man puts the base in the place of the noble, or the noble in the place of the base, then he has truly false opinion.</p>\n\n<p>S: [Socrates does realize and actually argues that a person can mistaken some one thing in his mind for another even though he knows both of them, like putting the foot in the wrong shoe]..There true and false opinion may arise, true&nbsp;when memory and impressions of sense meet straight and false when they go awry and crooked.</p>\n\n<p>S: So we have discovered that false opinion arises neither in the comparison of perceptions with one another nor yet in thought, but in union of thought and perception. One might ask &#39;you mean to say that the man whom we only think of and do not see, cannot be confused with the horse which we do not see or touch but only think of?&#39; - Yes, we shall reply. Well, then, he will say, the number 11, which is only thought, can never be mistaken for 12, which is only thought. Can a man not mistake 5+7 to be 11 rather than 12?</p>\n\n<p>S: Does it not imply that 12 in the waxen block [memory] are supposed to be 11. Then we come back to same old difficulty. For he who makes such mistake does think one thing which he knows to be another thing which he knows; but&nbsp; this we said, was impossible and afforded an irresistible proof of the non-existence of false opinion, because otherwise the same person would inevitably know and not know the same thing at the same time. Then false opinion cannot be explained as a confusion of thought and sense, for in that case we could not have been mistaken about pure conceptions of thought. Thus we must say, either that false opinion does not exist, or that a man may not know that which he knows. Let us attempt to explain the verb &#39;to know&#39; shamelessly.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>T: Why shameless?</p>\n\n<p>S: <span style=\"color:#2980b9;\">Is it not shameless when we do not know what knowledge is, to be explaining the verb &#39;to know&#39;?</span> The truth is that we have long been infected with logical impurity. Thousands of times have we repeated the words &#39;we know&#39; and &#39;do not know&#39; as if we could understand what we are saying to one another, so long as we remain ignorant about knowledge, at this moment we are using the words &#39;we understand&#39;, &#39;we are ignorant&#39;, as though we could still employ them when deprived of knowledge or science.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>T: But if you avoid these expressions, Socrates, how will you ever argue at all?</p>\n\n<p>S: I couldn&#39;t being the man I am. It would be different if I were a true hero of dialectic. Let&#39;s make an attempt anyway.</p>\n\n<p>S: They explain the word &#39;to know&#39; as meaning &#39;to have knowledge&#39;. I should make a slight change, and say &#39;to possess knowledge&#39;. I should distinguish &#39;having&#39; from &#39;possessing&#39;: e.g. a man may buy and keep under his control a garment which he does not wear; and then we should say, not that he has, but that he possesses the garment.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><em>[Plato here starts developing the theory of forms, sort of!]</em></p>\n\n<p>S: If a man has forms of knowledge in his mind, how can he mistake one form with another, e.g. if man knows number 5, 7, 11, 12 and every other number. How can he make a mistake when he looks for sum of 5, and 7? Having knowledge present with him in his mind, he should still know nothing and be ignorant of all things? - you might as well argue that ignorance may make a man know, and blindness make him see, as that knowledge can make him ignorant.</p>\n\n<p><em>[Socrates makes an illustration in which knowledge is like birds, which man puts in an&nbsp;aviary, and the&nbsp;man catches the bird when required]</em></p>\n\n<p>T: Perhaps, Socrates, we may have been wrong in making only forms of knowledge our birds: whereas there ought to have been forms of ignorance as well, flying about together in the mind, and then he who sought to take one of them might sometimes catch a form of knowledge, and sometimes a form of ignorance; and thus he would have a false opinion from ignorance, but a true one from knowledge, about the same thing.</p>\n\n<p>S: But he would certainly not think he has a false opinion. He will think he has captured knowledge and not ignorance. But if a man knows the form of ignorance and form of knowledge, can he think that one of them which he knows is the other which he knows, etc <em>[as shown in the above image]</em>? Back to original difficulty.</p>\n\n<p>S: We are wrong in seeking for false opinion until we know what knowledge is? - Yes. Then, once more, what shall we say that knowledge is.</p>\n\n<p><strong>T: Knowledge is true opinion which is unerring, and the results which follow from it are all noble and good.</strong></p>\n\n<p>S: Do you imagine that there are any teachers in the world so clever as to be able to convince others of the truth about acts of robbery or violence, of which they are not eye-witnesses.</p>\n\n<p>T: Certainly not, they can only persuade them.</p>\n\n<p>S: Persuading them is making them have an opinion? When, therefore, judges are persuaded about matters which you can know only by seeing them, and not in any other way, and when this judging of them from report they attain a true opinion about them, they judge without knowledge, and yet are rightly persuaded, if they have judged well. So, my dear, if true opinion in law courts and knowledge are the same, the perfect judge could not have judged rightly without knowledge; and therefore I must infer that they are not the same.</p>\n\n<p>T: .... True opinion, combined with reason, is knowledge. The opinion which has no reason is out of the sphere of knowledge, and the things of which there are no rational account are not knowable.</p>\n\n<p>S: .... There are some primeval letters or letters of which we and all other things are compounded, have no reason or explanation. You cannot define them, you can just name them. The elements and letters are only objects of perception, and cannot be defined or known; but the syllables or combinations of them are known and expressed, and are apprehended by true opinion. When, therefore, any one forms the true opinion of anything without rational explanation, you may say that his mind is truly exercised, but has no knowledge; for he who cannot give and receive a reason for a thing, has no knowledge of that thing; but when he adds rational explanation, then, he is perfected in knowledge and may be all that I have been denying of him.</p>\n\n<p>S: This is all good. But one thing does not quite satisfy me: That the elements or letters are unknown, but the combination or syllables known.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>S: Those who put this argument forth, what was the way in which they learned letters? and, first of all, are we right in saying that syllables have a definition, but that letters have no definition? I think yes - because if I ask you for first syllable of my name, you can say SO, but if I ask to define S and O?</p>\n\n<p>T: How can anyone tell the elements of the element? I can only reply, that S is a consonant, a mere noise, as of tthe tongue hissing; B and most other letters, again, are neither vowel-sounds nor noises. Thus letters may be most truly said to be undefined; for even the most distinct of them, which are the seven vowels, have a sound only, but no definition at all.</p>\n\n<p>S: But how can a person know the syllable and not know the constituents? It seems that the fine theory has again taken wings and departed.</p>\n\n<p>S: What if we consider syllables as a simple form arising out of the several combinations of harmonious elements - of letters or of any other elements. And it must have no parts because that which has parts must be a whole of all the parts. Or would you say that a whole, although formed out of the parts, is a single notion different from all the parts?</p>\n\n<p>T:&nbsp; I should.</p>\n\n<p>S: And would you say that all and the whole are the same, or different?</p>\n\n<p>T: Different.</p>\n\n<p>S: According to this new view, the whole is supposed to differ from all. Well, but is there any difference between all (in the plural) and the all (in the singular)? E.g. when we say 1,2,3,4,5,6; or when we say twice three, or three times two, or four and two, or three and two and one, are we speaking of the same or of different numbers? - Same, i.e. 6.</p>\n\n<p>S: And in each form of expression we spoke of all the six? - Yes.</p>\n\n<p>S: In speaking of all (in the plural) there is actually one thing which we express i.e. six. Then in predicating the word &#39;all&#39; of things measured by number, we predicate a singular and a plural at the same time. Number of acre and the acre are the same, the number of the stadium in like manner is the stadium, the army is the number of the army; and in all similar cases, the entire number of anything is the entire thing? - True.</p>\n\n<p>S: And the number of each is the parts of each? - Exactly.</p>\n\n<p>S: Then as many things as have parts are made up of parts. But all the parts are admitted to be the all, if the entire number is the all. Then the whole is not made up of parts, for it would be the all, if consisting of al the parts. But is a part a part of anything but the whole?</p>\n\n<p>T: Yes, of the all.</p>\n\n<p>S: And yet is not the all, that of which nothing is wanting? And is not a whole likewise that from which nothing is absent?&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>T: I now think that there is no difference between a whole and all.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>S: But we were saying that when a thing has parts, all the parts will be a whole and all. Then, as I was saying before, must not the alternative be that either the syllable is not the letters, and then letters are not parts of the syllable, or that the syllable will be the same with the letters, and will therefore be equally known with them?</p>\n\n<p>T: Right</p>\n\n<p>S: And, in order to avoid this, we suppose it to be different from them. But if letters are not part of the syllable, then there are no parts of the syllable with the same line of argument. Then, a syllable must surely be some indivisible form.</p>\n\n<p>S: But if the letters are indefinable and unknown then how can syllables be known. Also, from your learning experience, you know that you learn to distinguish between letters when you learn to read, then also, if we should not say that letters are unknown and syllable is known.</p>\n\n<p>S: When we say that knowledge is right opinion with rational definition or explanation, what do we mean by &#39;explanation&#39;? I think we have three choices for that:</p>\n\n<p>S: First one that meaning may be manifesting one&#39;s thoughts by the voice with verbs and nouns, imaging an opinion in the stream which flows from lips, as in mirror or water.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>S: Second, that we&nbsp;can enumerate the elements of which the thing is made of. E.g. a waggon consists of wheels, axle, body, rims, yoke should be enough when someone asks what is waggon.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#2980b9;\"><em>[But then how is this not enough when we explain syllables or names enumerating letters? ]</em></span></p>\n\n<p>S:...when a person is able to write the letters in order, he is correctly explaining a name, but if he doesn&#39;t have exactness of knowledge, if he has not attained the knowledge of syllables, even though he has right opinion and explanation.</p>\n\n<p>S: The third, telling the mark or sign of difference which distinguishes the thing in the question from all others. E.g. when we say the&nbsp;sun is the brightest of heavenly bodies which revolve&nbsp;about the earth, this satisfactorily defines the sun.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>S: Suppose I have true opinion of you, and if to this I add your definition, then I have knowledge, otherwise opinion only. The definition is supposed to be the interpretation&nbsp;of your difference. But when I had only opinion, I had no conception of your distinguishing characteristics. Then I must have conceived of some general or common nature which no more belonged to you than to another. How in that case could I have formed a judgement of you any more than of any one else? If I have right opinion about you I would recall you when I see you tomorrow, then I already must have something that makes you different from everyone else. Then right opinion implies the perception of differences.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>S: So, what is the point of adding definition or explanation to the right opinion? If the argument, in speaking of adding the definition, had used the word to &#39;know&#39;, and not merely &#39;have an opinion&#39; of the difference, this would have been end, for to know is surely to acquire knowledge.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>S: And, so when the&nbsp;question is asked, What is knowledge? this fair argument will answer &#39;Right opinion with knowledge (knowledge of difference)&#39;. [But this is circular] and utterly foolish. So, knowledge is neither sensation nor true opinion, nor yet definition and explanation accompanying and added to true opinion.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n","authorId":null,"subject":"philosophy","tags":["basic","intro"],"img":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cupitor-220103.appspot.com/images/plato.jpg","summary":"Socrates searches for \"What is knowledge?\" Difference between perception and knowledge?
