Imprtant to note:
-----------------
1. The tool can look complex at first. Check below to know about the tool.
2. The tool uses automated language translation. So, the translation may not be perfect, even though in most cases it works.

Learning Philosophy:
-------------------
Following are important aspects of learning a language:
Listening, Speaking, Reading, Writing.

1. You should be able to search words, their detail.
2. You should be able to see how those words are used in different context.
3. You should be able to see common words, phrases, sentences.
4. You should be able to listen to the pronunciation of the words/sentences.

The tool helps you in most of these. You should do the speaking, writing part yourself.

As of now, only the videos that I found interesting are available. But in the future, I will allow users to add the videos of their own choice.
